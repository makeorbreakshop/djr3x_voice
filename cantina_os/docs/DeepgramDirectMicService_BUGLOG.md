# DeepgramDirectMicService Implementation Plan

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: Our current audio pipeline has threading and event flow issues that create reliability problems and potential race conditions. The architecture uses two separate services:

1. MicInputService - Captures audio with sounddevice
2. DeepgramTranscriptionService - Processes captured audio and sends to Deepgram

This separation creates multiple thread-to-asyncio boundaries that must be carefully managed:
- Audio callback thread → Event Loop → Event Bus → Audio Queue → Deepgram Thread

## Investigation

### Current Implementation Analysis

The dev log (2025-05-12) indicates ongoing issues with our audio transcription pipeline:

> "Audio Pipeline Integration Issues Fixed:
> - Fixed critical issue where audio wasn't reaching Deepgram
> - Updated to Deepgram SDK v4.0.0 with proper event handler registration
> - Implemented proper thread-to-asyncio bridging for audio callbacks
> - Enhanced debugging and monitoring capabilities"

Despite these fixes, we're still experiencing complexity and reliability issues with this approach.

### Deepgram Microphone Class Capability

Investigating the Deepgram Python SDK documentation reveals that Deepgram provides a built-in `Microphone` class that directly streams audio from the local microphone to their service:

```python
# Example from Deepgram docs
microphone = Microphone(dg_connection.send)
microphone.start()
# ...
microphone.finish()
```

This allows bypassing our complex threading architecture entirely by letting Deepgram handle both audio capture and streaming.

## Proposed Solution

We propose creating a new `DeepgramDirectMicService` that:

1. Uses Deepgram's built-in `Microphone` class to capture and stream audio directly
2. Eliminates our custom audio capture and intermediate event bus messaging
3. Simplifies the threading model by reducing thread-to-asyncio boundaries
4. Maintains compatibility with our existing event system

### Alignment with Architecture Standards

This solution aligns with multiple guidelines from our [ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md](../ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md):

1. **Section 9: Audio Processing Standards**:
   - "Use a dedicated thread for audio I/O operations" - Deepgram's `Microphone` class handles this for us
   - "Single direction of data flow" - Direct flow from microphone to Deepgram
   - "Minimize thread crossings" - Eliminates intermediate event bus

2. **Section 3: Asynchronous Programming**:
   - "Always manage tasks properly" - Simpler task management with fewer components
   - "Handle task cancellation properly" - Cleaner lifecycle with fewer moving parts

3. **Section 2: Error Handling**:
   - "Use consistent error handling pattern" - Simplified error flow means more predictable handling
   - "Service status reporting" - Clearer status reporting with a unified service

## Complete Pipeline Integration

The new service will maintain full compatibility with our existing conversation pipeline:

```
User Speech → DeepgramDirectMicService → GPTService → ElevenLabsService → Audio Response
```

### Integration with Other Services

1. **GPT Service Integration**:
   - DeepgramDirectMicService will emit the same `TRANSCRIPTION_FINAL` and `TRANSCRIPTION_INTERIM` events
   - GPTService will continue to subscribe to these events without modification
   - Text processing and response generation will work as before
   - No changes needed to GPTService

2. **ElevenLabs Service Integration**:
   - GPTService will continue to emit `SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_REQUESTED` events
   - ElevenLabsService will process these events as before
   - Text-to-speech conversion and playback remain unchanged
   - No changes needed to ElevenLabsService

3. **Event Topics Maintained**:
   - All existing event topics will be maintained for compatibility
   - Event payload structures will remain consistent
   - This ensures other services can continue functioning without changes

### Conversation Flow

1. User speaks → DeepgramDirectMicService captures and transcribes
2. DeepgramDirectMicService emits `TRANSCRIPTION_FINAL` event with text
3. GPTService processes text and generates response
4. GPTService emits `SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_REQUESTED` with response text
5. ElevenLabsService converts text to speech and plays audio
6. User hears response and conversation continues

## Implementation Plan

### Service Structure

The new service will follow our `StandardService` template pattern:

```python
class DeepgramDirectMicService(StandardService):
    """
    Service that directly captures and streams microphone audio to Deepgram.
    
    Features:
    - Direct microphone integration using Deepgram's Microphone class
    - Streaming transcription with interim and final results
    - Configurable Deepgram model and language options
    """
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        event_bus,
        config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None
    ):
        # Initialize with standard template pattern
        super().__init__(event_bus, config or {}, logger, name="deepgram_direct_mic")
        # ...
```

### Core Components

1. **Service Configuration**:
   - Deepgram API key and transcription options
   - Microphone device configuration
   - Processing options (language, model, etc.)

2. **Client Management**:
   - Deepgram client initialization
   - WebSocket connection handling
   - Event callback setup

3. **Lifecycle Methods**:
   - Proper initialization in `_start()`
   - Clean resource handling in `_stop()`
   - State management throughout

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Voice control event subscriptions
   - Transcript event processing and emission
   - Error handling and reporting

### Event Flow

1. User initiates voice recording (via CLI, push-to-talk, etc.)
2. System emits `VOICE_LISTENING_STARTED` event
3. DeepgramDirectMicService handles event, initializes Deepgram client
4. Service starts the Deepgram microphone capture
5. Deepgram processes audio and returns transcription results
6. Service emits transcription events (interim & final) **with identical format**
7. GPTService processes transcription and generates response
8. GPTService emits `SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_REQUESTED` event
9. ElevenLabsService converts text to speech and plays audio

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - Single service for audio capture and transcription
   - Fewer components to manage and debug
   - Clearer event flow

2. **Improved Reliability**:
   - Reduced thread boundary crossings
   - Fewer race condition opportunities
   - Leverages Deepgram's optimized implementation

3. **Better Performance**:
   - Lower latency with direct streaming
   - Reduced CPU usage
   - Less event bus traffic for audio data

4. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Less custom code to maintain
   - Better alignment with SDK provider recommendations
   - Clearer debugging and error reporting

5. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Maintains compatibility with GPTService and ElevenLabsService
   - No changes required to other services
   - Complete conversation pipeline preserved
