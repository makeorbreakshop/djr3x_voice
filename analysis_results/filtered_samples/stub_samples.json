Comprising movies, novels, comics, video games, toys, and numerous television series, the ''Star Wars'' franchise employs archetypal motifs common to religions, classical mythology, and political climax, as well as musical motifs of those same aspects.\n\nAs one of the foremost examples of the [[Wikipedia:space opera|space opera]] [[Wikipedia:Science fiction genre|subgenre of science fiction]], ''Star Wars'' has become part of mainstream popular culture, as well as being one of the highest-grossing series of all time.<ref name=\"thirdhighest\">{{WebCite|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/star-wars-overtakes-james-bond-become-third-highest-grossing-movie-franchise|text=Star Wars Overtakes James Bond To Become Third Highest-Grossing Movie Franchise|author=Briers, Michael|date=2016-12-29|work=[https://wegotthiscovered.com We Got This Covered]|archivedate=20170128095116}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2012]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] bought the rights to the franchise from George Lucas for 4.05 billion dollars. Since then, Disney has split off ''Star Wars'' into two main categories, those being [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] and ''Star Wars'' [[Canon]], with Canon being the \"official\" story of the franchise.\n\nThe catalyst of the multimedia franchise was the release of its mainline story, officially known as [[Star Wars saga|the Skywalker Saga]]; a collection of 9 films released from the years [[1977]] to [[2019]], with the first and last release of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] and [[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']], respectively. Despite the saga's ending, the franchise still continues strong, mainly due to the success of [[Disney+]] original television series, both live-action, such as ''[[The Mandalorian]]'', and animated, such as ''[[Star Wars: The Bad Batch]]'', as well as publishing projects such as ''[[Star Wars: The High Republic]]''.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Atathoth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-ATs]] on [[Hoth]]]]\n{{Quote|George Lucas has achieved what few artists do; he has created and populated a world of his own. His 'Star Wars' movies are among the most influential, both technically and commercially, ever made.|Roger Ebert|<ref name=\"Ebert quote\">{{WebCite|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050519/REVIEWS/50503002/1023|text=Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|author=Roger, Ebert|date=2005-05-19|work=rogerebert.suntimes.com|archivedate=20050605081357|nolive=1}}</ref>}}\nThe ''Star Wars'' story has been presented in a series of [[Wikipedia:Cinema of the United States|American films]], which have spawned a large quantity of books and other media, which have formed the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]]. The ''Star Wars'' mythos is also the basis of many toys and games of varying types. The films and novels employ common science-fiction motifs.\n\nWhereas [[W:c:memory-alpha:Gene Roddenberry|Gene Roddenberry's]] [[Memoryalpha:Star Trek|''Star Trek'']], a [[Wikipedia:science fantasy|science fantasy]] franchise that has enjoyed long-lasting popularity in [[Wikipedia:Culture of the United States|American popular culture]], and often combines magical/supernatural elements with a rational and progressive approach to storytelling, ''Star Wars'' has a strong mythic quality alongside its political and scientific elements.\n\nUnlike the heroes of earlier space-set sci-fi/fantasy film and TV series, such as [[Wikipedia:Flash Gordon (serial)|''Flash Gordon'']], the heroes of ''Star Wars'' are not militaristic types but romantic individualists. College literature professors have remarked that the ''Star Wars'' saga, with its struggle between good and evil, democracy and [[Galactic Empire|empire]], can be considered a national epic for the [[Wikipedia:United States|United States]]. The film has many visual and narrative similarities to [[Wikipedia:John Ford|John Ford's]] ''[[Wikipedia:The Searchers|The Searches]]'', which also provides a clue to the relationship between [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and [[Luke Skywalker]].\n\nGeorge Lucas attributed the strong appeal of ''Star Wars'' to it being a mythology that takes from thousand-year-old psychological motifs and underpinnings of humanity. Particularly, Lucas saw children as the prime audience for such stories. The ''Star Wars'' films show considerable similarity to Japanese ''[[Wikipedia:Jidaigeki|Jidaigeki]]'' films, as well as [[Wikipedia:Roman mythology|Roman mythology]]. Lucas has stated that his intention was to create in ''Star Wars'' a modern mythology, based on the studies of his friend and mentor [[Wikipedia:Joseph Campbell|Joseph Campbell]]. He has also called the first movie's similarity to the film [[Wikipedia:The Hidden Fortress|''The Hidden Fortress'']] ([[Wikipedia:Akira Kurosawa|Akira Kurosawa]]) an \"homage.\"\n\nThe ''Star Wars'' films portray a world full of grime and technology that looks like it has been used for years, unlike the sleek, futuristic world typical of earlier science-fiction films. In interviews, Lucas tells of rubbing the new props with dirt to make them look weatherworn. Lucas may have been inspired by the [[Wikipedia:Sergio Leone|Sergio Leone]] [[Wikipedia:Spaghetti Western|Spaghetti Western]] films of the [[1960s]], which performed a similar function on the [[Wikipedia:Western (genre)|Western]] many years earlier. It is tempting to speculate that this break from traditional science-fiction film influenced the [[Wikipedia:cyberpunk|cyberpunk]] genre that emerged around [[1984]].\n\nLicensed ''Star Wars'' novels have been published since the original movie was released in [[1977]]. Although these novels are licensed by Lucas (meaning he shares in the royalties), he retains ultimate creative control over the ''Star Wars'' universe, forcing [[Lucas Licensing]] to devote considerable ongoing effort to ensuring continuity between different authors' works and Lucas' films. Occasionally, elements from these novels are adopted into the highest tier of ''Star Wars'' [[canon]], the movies. Books, games, and stories that are not directly derived from the nine movies of ''Star Wars'' are known as the Extended or Expanded Universe (EU for short). Lucas has said that he does not deeply involve himself in the EU, choosing instead to concentrate mainly on his movies instead of \"&hellip;the licensing world of the books, games and comic books.\"\n\nThe original (1977) ''Star Wars'' ([[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']]) and the first sequel, [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''The Empire Strikes Back'']] (1980), have been selected for preservation in the United States [[Wikipedia:National Film Registry|National Film Registry]].\n\nIn [[1978]], Lucas sued the creators of [[Wikipedia:Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] for its similarity to ''Star Wars''. The case was dismissed as having no merit in [[1980]] by a [[Wikipedia:United States federal judge|U.S. Federal judge]].\n\nThe mainline story of ''Star Wars'', known as the [[The Skywalker Saga]], ended in 2019 with the release of [[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker]]. However, the ''Star Wars'' franchise itself has not ended, and is continuing to move on past the story of the original saga with shows like [[The Mandalorian]] and the upcoming project known as the [[Star Wars: The High Republic]].\n\n==History==\n===Original Trilogy===\n====''Star Wars'' (''A New Hope'')====\nAlthough [[George Lucas]] had made a name for himself among some industry insiders for his work at [[Wikipedia:University of Southern California|USC]], it was not until the release of ''[[Wikipedia:American Graffiti|American Graffiti]]'' in August of [[1973]] that he reached stardom. The film grossed over $115 million at the box office and was dollar-for-dollar the most profitable film in the history of Hollywood at the time. Lucas' profit participation in ''Graffiti'' earned him over $7 million. Lucas was now a millionaire and one of the most sought after young directors in the world.\n\n[[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], then the head of [[20th Century Studios|Twentieth Century Fox]], saw a smuggled print of ''American Graffiti'' before it was released in theaters and was determined that Fox was going to be the next studio to profit from Lucas' genius.\n\n=====Influences=====\n[[File:Star_Wars_poster.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Poster art for ''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]\nMany different influences have been suggested for the ''Star Wars'' films by fans, critics, and George Lucas himself. Lucas has said that the plot and characters in the [[1950s#1958|1958]] Japanese film ''The Hidden Fortress'', directed by Akira Kurosawa, was a major inspiration. Additionally, the film influenced Lucas to tell the story of ''Star Wars'' from the viewpoint of the humble droids, rather than a major player. It also played a role in the conception of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], whose trademark black [[helmet]] intentionally resembles a [[Wikipedia:Samurai|samurai]] [[Wikipedia:Kabuto|helmet]].\n\nGeorge Lucas has often said that his original idea for the project that evolved into ''Star Wars'' was to remake the Flash Gordon movie serials from the 1930s (a \"serial\" is a movie shown in weekly installments of about 10-20 minutes each). The license wasn't available, so Lucas moved on to other ideas, beginning with Akira Kurosawa's film ''The Hidden Fortress'' and then Joseph Campbell's ''[[Wikipedia:The Hero with a Thousand Faces|The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''. Despite the plot changes the ''Star Wars'' films are still bursting with influences from the Flash Gordon movie serials, including the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebels]] vs. the Imperial Forces, [[Cloud City]] and even the famous \"roll up\" which begins the movie.\n\nThe second major direction for ''Star Wars'' (used in the 1973 synopsis) was to use the Flash Gordon \"vocabulary\" to create an outer-space version of the Samurai films of Akira Kurosawa, primarily ''Kakushi toride no san akunin'' (''The Hidden Fortress'', 1958), ''[[Wikipedia:Yojimbo|Yojimbo]]'' (1961) and ''Tsubaki Sanj\u016br\u014d'' (''[[Wikipedia:Sanjuro|Sanjuro]]'', 1962). Joseph Campbell's ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' eventually gave Lucas a third and final major story direction, but many elements from Kurosawa's work remain, including the two bickering peasants (who evolved into the droids), and the queen who often switches places with her handmaiden. The Darth Vader-like evil general who has a change of heart at the end wears a [[Wikipedia:Mon (emblem)|kamon]] (a Japanese family crest) that looks very similar to the [[Wikipedia:Imperial Seal of Japan|Japanese Imperial Crest]].\n\nLucas had already written two drafts of ''Star Wars'' when he rediscovered Joseph Campbell's ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' in 1975 (having read it years before in college). This blueprint for \"The Hero's Journey\" gave Lucas the focus he needed to draw his sprawling imaginary universe into a single story. Campbell demonstrates in his book that all stories are expressions of the same story-pattern, which he named the ''Hero's Journey'' or the ''monomyth''.\n\nLucas has often cited The ''[[W:c:lotr:The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'' series as a major influence on ''Star Wars''. Lucas learned from [[W:c:lotr:J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] how to handle the delicate stuff of myth. Tolkien wrote that myth and fairytale seem to be the best way to communicate morality - hints for choosing between right and wrong - and in fact that may be their primary purpose. Lucas has also acknowledged in interviews that the [[W:c:lotr:Gandalf|Gandalf]] and the [[W:c:lotr:Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king]] characters in the ''Lord of the Rings'' influenced the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and Darth Vader characters respectively.\n\n=====Screenplays=====\nThere are many myths surrounding the writing of ''Star Wars'', many perpetuated by [[Lucasfilm]] and George Lucas himself. Author Michael Kaminski tried to set the record straight in his book ''The Secret History of Star Wars'', as did [[Jonathan W. Rinzler|Jonathan Rinzler]] in [[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film|''The Making of Star Wars'']], both released in [[2007]].\n\nLucas' original concept was a swashbuckling space adventure movie. He says \"the film was a good concept in search of a story\". He first tried to have a child buy the rights to remake Flash Gordon, but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1971, [[Wikipedia:United Artists|United Artists]] agreed to make ''American Graffiti'' and ''Star Wars'' in a two-picture contract, though they would reject ''Star Wars'' in its early concept stages. ''Graffiti'' was made first, and when it was completed in 1973, Lucas set to work on making his space adventure movie. In early 1973, Lucas wrote a short summary called \"The Journal of the Whills,\" which told the tale of the training of apprentice C.J. Thorpe as a \"Jedi-Bendu\" space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.\n\nFrustrated that his story was too hard to understand, Lucas wrote a 13-page treatment called [[The Star Wars: Rough Draft|''The Star Wars'']], which loosely based on the structure of Akira Kurosawa's ''The Hidden Fortress''. By 1974, he had expanded the treatment into [[The Star Wars: First Draft|a rough-draft screenplay]], which added elements such as the Sith and the Death Star, and once more had the protagonist as a young boy, named [[Annikin Starkiller]]. For [[Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars|the second draft]], Lucas made heavy simplifications, and also introduced the young hero on a farm, with his name now Luke rather than Annikin. Luke/Annikin's father is still an active character in the story at this point, a wise Jedi knight, and \"the Force\" now became a supernatural power. [[The Star Wars: From The Adventures of Luke Starkiller|The next draft]] removed the father character and replaced him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi, and in 1976 a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography. The film was titled ''Adventures of Luke Starkiller, as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars''. During production, Lucas changed Luke's last name to Skywalker and altered the title to just ''The Star Wars'' and finally ''Star Wars''.\n\nAt this point, Lucas was thinking of the film as the only entry that would be made&mdash;the fourth draft underwent subtle changes that made it more satisfying as a self-contained film that ended with the destruction of the Empire itself, as the Death Star was said to achieve; possibly this was a result of the frustrating difficulties Lucas had encountered in pre-production during that period. However, in previous times Lucas had conceived of the film as the first in a series of adventures. The second draft contained a teaser for a never-made sequel about \"The Princess of Ondos,\" and by the time of the third draft some months later, Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to make two sequels. Not long after, Lucas met with author [[Alan Dean Foster]] and hired him to write these two sequels&mdash;as novels. The intention was that if ''Star Wars'' was successful&mdash;and if Lucas felt like it&mdash;the novels could be adapted into screenplays. He had also by this point developed a fairly elaborate backstory&mdash;though this was not designed or intended for filming; it was merely backstory. \"The backstory wasn't meant to be a movie,\" Lucas has said.\n\nWhen ''Star Wars'' was successful, and not just successful but the biggest hit ever made at that time, Lucas decided to use the film as a springboard for an elaborate serial, although he considered walking away from the series altogether. However, Lucas wanted to create an independent filmmaking center&mdash;what would become [[Skywalker Ranch]]&mdash;and saw an opportunity to use the series as a financing agent for him. Alan Dean Foster had already begun writing the sequel as a novel, but Lucas decided to disregard that for filming and create more elaborate film sequels; the book was released as ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' the next year. At first Lucas envisioned an unlimited number of sequels, much like the [[W:c:jamesbond:James Bond films|''James Bond'' series]], and in an interview with [[Wikipedia:Rolling Stone|''Rolling Stone'']] in August of 1977 said that he wanted his friends to take a try directing them and giving unique interpretations on the series. He also said that the backstory where Darth Vader turns to the dark side, kills Luke's father and fights Ben Kenobi on a volcano as the Republic falls would make an excellent sequel. Later that year, Lucas hired sci-fi author [[Leigh Brackett]] to write \"Star Wars II\" with him. They held story conferences together, and in late November of 1977 Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment called ''The Empire Strikes Back''. The story is very similar to the final film except Darth Vader does not reveal he is Luke's father. In the first draft that Leigh Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke.\n\nDuring this period, Lucas had now had time to attach a numeric figure to the amount of sequels&mdash;he revealed to ''[[Wikipedia:Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in [[March]] 1978 that there would be twelve films altogether. This was then revealed in the official ''Star Wars'' fanclub newsletter, [[Bantha Tracks (newsletter)|''Bantha Tracks'']]. The figure of 12 was likely selected due to its tradition in serial episodes.\n\nBrackett finished her first draft of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' in early 1978; Lucas has said he was disappointed with it, but before he could discuss it with her she had died from cancer. With no writer available, Lucas had to write his second draft himself. Here Lucas finally made use of the \"Episode\" listing in the film&mdash;''The Empire Strikes Back'' was Episode II. As Michael Kaminski argues in ''The Secret History of Star Wars'', the disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions to take the story in. Here he made use of a new plot twist: Darth Vader says he is Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the year-long struggles of the first film, and quickly wrote two more drafts in the same month&mdash;[[April]] of 1978&mdash;which both retained the new Vader-as-father plot. He also took this darker ending farther by imprisoning [[Han Solo]] in [[carbonite]] and leaving him in limbo.\n\nThis new storyline where Vader was Luke's father had drastic effects on the series. Michael Kaminski argues in his book that it is unlikely that this was a plot point that had seriously been considered before 1978, or even thought of before then, and that the first film was clearly operating under an alternate storyline where Vader was separate from Luke's father; there is not a single reference to the Vader-as-father plot point before 1978. After the second and third drafts of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', where Lucas first introduced this point, he reviewed the new backstory he had now created: Annikin Skywalker is Ben Kenobi's brilliant student, has a child (Luke) but is swayed to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark-side]] by the [[Darth Sidious|Emperor]] (who was now a [[Sith]] and not just a politician), [[Duel on Mustafar|battles]] Ben Kenobi on the site of a volcano and is wounded but resurrected as Darth Vader; meanwhile, Kenobi hides Luke on [[Tatooine]] while the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] becomes the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]] and Vader has hunted down the [[Jedi Knight]]s. With this new backstory, Lucas decided to film this as a trilogy&mdash;moving ''The Empire Strikes Back'' from Episode II to Episode V in the next draft. [[Lawrence Kasdan]], who had just completed writing ''[[W:c:indianajones:raiders of the Lost Ark|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', was then hired to write the next drafts, and was helped by additional input from director [[Irvin Kershner]]. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer [[Gary Kurtz]] saw the film as a more serious and adult film, which was helped by the new, darker storyline, and brought the series far away from the light adventure roots it had existed as only a year earlier.\n\nLucas had also around this time developed a third trilogy as well, which took place twenty years after [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|Episode VI]].\n\nBy the time of writing Episode VI&mdash;''[[Star Wars: Episode VI Revenge of the Jedi|Revenge of the Jedi]]'', as it was then known&mdash;in [[1981]], much had changed. Making ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was stressful and costly, and Lucas' personal life was disintegrating. Burnt out and not wanting to make any more ''Star Wars'' films, he vowed to be done with the series, as he makes explicit in a [[May]] [[1983]] interview with ''Time'' magazine. Lucas' 1981 rough drafts of ''Revenge of the Jedi'' had Darth Vader competing with the Emperor for possession of Luke&mdash;and in the second script, the \"revised rough draft,\" Vader was turned into a sympathetic character. Lawrence Kasdan was hired to take over once again, and in these final drafts Vader was explicitly redeemed, and finally unmasked. This change in character would provide a springboard for the \"Tragedy of Darth Vader\" storyline in the prequels.\n\n=====Cast and crew=====\n[[File:3p-anthony.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Anthony Daniels reflects (literally) on his portrayal of C-3PO]]\nSince most major motion-picture companies no longer had special-effects teams, or they thought the American public was no longer interested in nonrealistic films, George Lucas had to create one from scratch. He eventually put together a team of model makers and special-effects people to create [[Industrial Light & Magic]]. The team worked in a run-down part of [[Wikipedia:Van Nuys|Van Nuys]] in a cramped work space that no one liked. Lucas himself bought old equipment for pennies on the dollar.<ref name=\"encore\">[[Industrial Light & Magic: Creating the Impossible]]</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, George Lucas was looking for actors for ''Star Wars''. Lucas had decided to go with a group of unknowns, against the advice of his friend [[Wikipedia:Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Ford Coppola]], who had picked famous stage and screen actors for [[Wikipedia:The Godfather|''The Godfather'']]. Hundreds of actors and actresses tried out for the three main roles, Luke Skywalker, [[Princess]] Leia and Han Solo. Actors like [[Wikipedia:Burt Reynolds|Burt Reynolds]] and actresses like [[Wikipedia:Jodie Foster|Jodie Foster]] tried out for the parts, but Lucas eventually chose 25-year-old [[Mark Hamill]] (who had only worked on television) as Luke Skywalker and 19-year-old [[Carrie Fisher]], daughter of Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, as Princess Leia. Initially, Harrison Ford was not eligible for the role of Han Solo because he had worked with Lucas on ''American Graffiti'' but eventually swayed Lucas over after helping the other actors and actresses with their lines and got the part.\n\nAfter casting the initial group, Lucas had to find actors for two of the film's droids, [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]]. ILM had made some quaint remote-controlled robots, but these parts would require living actors. In came three-foot comedian [[Kenny Baker]]. Due to his shortness and the fact that kids could not control this heavy machine, he got the part of R2. [[Anthony Daniels]], however, did not want the part of C-3PO until he saw a drawing of C-3PO by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], and he instantly wanted the part and got it. Lucas eventually found Australia native [[Peter Mayhew]], who was over seven feet tall, making him the perfect size for Han Solo's furry [[Wookiee]] counterpart, [[Chewbacca]]. After casting all the characters, Lucas began production on ''Star Wars'' in mid-1976.\n\n=====''Star Wars'' comes to life=====\nThe cast and crew of ''Star Wars'' began filming in Tunisia, North Africa where mid-morning temperatures reached 105 degrees. Many crew members and cast workers thought the movie was a joke and between problems on props and machinery, during filming Tunisia had their largest rainstorm in many years. Through it all [[Alec Guinness]], the Academy Award&ndash;winning actor who was cast as the wise mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, kept up a positive attitude and inspired the cast. The only silver lining was that after Africa, the team would be filming at a more controlled area, [[Elstree Studios]] in London.\n\nAfter finishing up filming in Africa, the entire cast and crew of ''Star Wars'' finally came together to film the action sequences on the [[Death Star]] battle station. While this was happening, problems at ILM were far worse than the filming ones. Lucas eventually had to supervise every day at ILM, causing him to nearly have a heart attack. Meanwhile, Fox studios had had enough of George Lucas and his \"kid's movie\" and asked Alan Ladd, Jr. to terminate the project. Instead, Alan told Lucas he had only a few weeks to finish filming or have his movie fail. The last few climactic scenes were finished quickly with Lucas biking from soundstage to soundstage. Eventually, the film was finished, and the process to edit and fix his film began.\n\n=====Problems ''Star Wars'' faced=====\nWhen Lucas saw the first cut of his film, he was horrified. To make matters worse, he had to fire his editor. Luckily, his replacements (including his then wife [[Marcia Lucas|Marcia]]) greatly improved the film, but Lucas still insisted on reshooting some scenes. This, among other reasons, forced Fox to move the release date from Christmas [[1976]] to summer 1977. After showing the film without its music score to some of his friends, only [[Steven Spielberg]], who had recently become an A-list director with the release of [[Wikipedia:Jaws (film)|Jaws]], liked it. However, when Fox executives saw it they loved it. With his film cut and most of the sounds for the film completed (and with the help of [[Ben Burtt]]), Lucas started to think about his film's score. It was Spielberg who recommended [[John Williams]] (who had just scored ''Jaws''). This was considered a gutsy move because thematic scores were out of style at the time, but Lucas went ahead with it.\n\n=====Pre-release=====\nAfter the score was completed, Lucas began to market his picture. However, many people thought it would be a flop, so not many people went with him. One company that did, however, was the toy company [[Kenner Products]], who decided to make a few figures for the release. Eventually, Lucas's film was released on May 25, 1977. It would be a day they would never forget.\n\n=====Success=====\nWhen ''Star Wars'' opened, it initially opened at a few theaters. A month after its release, ''Star Wars'' played at almost every theater in the country and hundreds worldwide. People, especially children, flocked to see the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia again and again and again. Lines stretched for miles. Kenner, caught up in a vortex, ran out of toys by early fall of the film's release. So, the infamous \"Empty Box\" scheme was formed. Fox's stock rocketed up. Merchandise flew off the shelves by the thousands and Lucas became very rich. ''Star Wars''{{'}} run eventually ended by early 1978 with over 260 million dollars, making it the most successful film in history at that time. It would be re-released over the next 20 years, adding 220 million to its overall total. Currently, it is the second-highest American grossing film of all time (in inflation-adjusted dollars), second only to [[Wikipedia:Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']].\n\n''Star Wars'' was nominated for 10 Oscars including Best Picture and won 6 of them. But just being nominated for it showed Fox and Lucas, who knew all along, that this was not a \"kids' film.\"\n\n====''The Empire Strikes Back''====\n[[File:Empire_strikes_back_old.jpg|right|200px|Original poster art for ''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]\nIn 1978, with George Lucas a millionaire, he began taking his screenplays for Episodes V and VI and turning them into films, as, despite later declarations, he was already developing the idea of a \"trilogy of trilogies\" of which ''Star Wars'' would have been only Episode IV.<ref name=\"Starlog50\">{{Starlog|50|Starlog (magazine)|Log Entries}}</ref> In early 1978, Lucas began working on ''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back''. ''Star Wars'' was also retitled ''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope''. However, this time Lucas left the Director's Guild, and Irvin Kershner was the new director with Lucas as the producer. Filming began in mid to late 1978 with the snowy planet of Hoth scenes being filmed in Norway. However, during filming, as if a curse, Norway suffered their worst snowstorm in many years. Mark Hamill, who was still recovering from his car accident injuries, filmed in a scene in the snow while the crew stayed in their hotel rooms. After the filming there concluded, the next part of the filming process turned to Elstree Studios.\n\nSince Lucas wanted this movie to be bigger and more spectacular than ''Star Wars'', more sets were made and new characters were introduced, which included the first black ''Star Wars'' character, [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], played by [[Billy Dee Williams]], and a 2-foot puppet named [[Yoda]] voiced by [[Frank Oz]]. It was also the first time that Han Solo and Princess Leia kissed. But the biggest surprise was Darth Vader's revelation to Luke. A few minutes before shooting that scene, Kershner told Hamill that Vader was Luke's father. To stop the big reveal leaking, [[David Prowse]], the man in the Vader suit, was given a different line to say on set, \"Obi-Wan killed your father.\" When they recorded Vader's dialogue with [[James Earl Jones]], the line was {{Audio|NoIAmYourFather-ESB.ogg|\"No. I am your father.\"}} This line would later spark the lightsaber duel in Episode VI and all the prequels.\n\nMany people believed that the sequel would not be as good as ''Star Wars'', but audiences didn't think so. ''The Empire Strikes Back'' took in 6.4 million dollars of the weekend of May 21, 1980. It was also considered the darkest ''Star Wars'' movie until [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] was released. However, its gross in the U.S. ended at 290 million dollars, making it the lowest-grossing ''Star Wars'' movie.\n\n====''Return of the Jedi''====\n[[File:Return_of_the_jedi_old.jpg|left|200px|Original poster art for [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]]]\n\nBefore beginning the production of Episode VI, Lucas, using the profits from ''Star Wars'' and ''Empire'', made Skywalker Ranch, a place where friends of Lucas could hang out and work on movies, mostly ''Star Wars''&ndash;related things. It would be used more during the making of the [[prequel trilogy]].\n\nIn early [[1982]], Lucas still out of the director's chair, [[Richard Marquand]] began shooting ''Revenge of the Jedi''. Some of the new things in the films included a speeder-bike chase, a [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] and one of the most controversial groups of characters in ''Star Wars'' history, the [[Ewok]]s. Also, to keep the title of Episode VI from leaking out, the title ''Blue Harvest: Horror Beyond Imagination'' was the working \"title\" of the movie. After filming for ''Jedi'' completed, a few months before the film's release, Lucas changed the title to ''Return of the Jedi'', stating, \"revenge was not a quality of the Jedi,\" although some industry insiders attribute the title's change to ''Star Trek II : Wrath of Khan'' being released around the same time and Fox, and possibly Lucas, not wanting audiences confused between the similar titles. The \"Revenge\" title would eventually be used for Episode III.\n\nAfter ''Jedi'' broke single- and opening-day box office records on May 25, 1983, six years after the original ''Star Wars'' opening, George Lucas's wife divorced him, leaving him to raise his children. Afterwards, Lucas established several Lucasfilm companies including [[THX]] Sound and Picture, the [[Pixar]] Animation Studios (which would later be sold to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]), and several others. In May [[1987]], ten years after the first movie's release, Lucas announced a second trilogy and hinted at a third. In mid-[[1996]], with all the technology necessary, Lucas began working on the ''Star Wars'' movies the way he wanted them, adding new scenes and changes along with THX Sound and excellent picture quality.\n\n===Growth of the Expanded Universe===\nBeginning with ''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'', the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe was populated by a slow trickle of novels, comic strips and television specials.\n\nAlmost a decade after the release of ''Return of the Jedi'', ''Star Wars'' merchandising sales had ground to a halt. In an effort to revitalize interest and capitalize on the success of other franchises in books, [[Bantam Spectra]] and Lucas Licensing planned a four-year publication run that would include several ''Star Wars'' novels.\n[[File:Heirtotheempire.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Heir to the Empire'' re-ignited the Expanded Universe in 1991.]]\n\nIt was [[1991]]'s ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' that sparked the success of the first run of new novels and signaled a renaissance in ''Star Wars'' publishing. The [[Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy|Thrawn Trilogy]] by Hugo Award&ndash;winning author Timothy Zahn would become one of the most popular science-fiction series to date, and introduced some of the Expanded Universe's best-known characters, like [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]] and [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]]. Bantam would continue to publish dozens of books across a number of eras, leading to the use of era markers after Bantam was sold to [[Del Rey]].\n\nBut books were just the beginning. In the same year as Zahn's success, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released ''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]'', the first serious ''Star Wars'' graphic novel. It too would be followed by dozens of comic series.\n\n''Star Wars'' video and computer games also contributed to the Expanded Universe, but 1996's [[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|''Shadows of the Empire'']] multimedia campaign marked a turning point. The simultaneous release of a novel, video game, comics, soundtrack, toys and other promotional tie-ins set the standard that would later be followed for the merchandising efforts of the prequel trilogy and expanded upon for the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].\n\n===Special Editions===\n[[File:SpecEditionLogo.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Special Edition logo]]\nIn the 1990s, with ILM's advancement in technology, George Lucas sought to refine his ''Star Wars'' films, and began altering them to in an effort to fulfill his original intentions when creating the films. New scenes were added as a result, although some minor aesthetic changes came to be items of controvery amongst fans. Despite this, some fans praised other changes.\n\n===Prequel Trilogy===\n{{Quote|You know, our films weren't much liked when they came out, by my generation who loved the first ones. I think people of our generation wanted to feel the way they'd felt when they saw those first three movies when they were kids, and George ''[Lucas]'' wanted to take our ones in a different direction, he had a different idea. It was tricky at the time, I remember. But now, all these years later, I'm really aware of what our films meant to the generation they were made for, the children of that time. They really like them. I've met people who, they mean a lot to them, those films, more so than the original three, and I'm like, 'Are you kidding?'|[[Ewan McGregor]] on the audience reception to prequel trilogy|<ref name=\"Empire quote\">{{WebCite|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/obi-wan-ewan-mcgregor-why-excited-to-return-star-wars|text=Obi-Wan: Ewan McGregor On Why He's So Excited To Return To Star Wars|author=Travis, Ben|date=2020-09-11|work=[[Wikipedia:Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']]|archivedate=20200912005133}}</ref>}}\n\n====Development====\nAfter getting a divorce in 1983 and losing much of his fortune, Lucas had no desire to return to ''Star Wars'', and had unofficially canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of ''Return of the Jedi''. However, the prequels, which were quite developed, remained fascinating to him. After ''Star Wars'' became popular once again, in the wake of Dark Horse's comic line and [[Timothy Zahn]]'s Thrawn Trilogy novels, Lucas saw that there was still a large audience. His children had begun to grow older, and with the explosion of CG technology, he was now considering returning to directing. By 1993 it was announced, in ''Variety'' among other sources, that he would be making the prequels. He began outlining the story, now offering that Anakin Skywalker would be the protagonist rather than Ben Kenobi and that the series would be a tragic one examining his transformation to evil. He also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals&mdash;at first they were supposed to be a \"filling-in\" of history, backstory, existing parallel or tangential to the originals, but now he began to see that they could form the beginning of one long story: beginning with Anakin's childhood and ending with Anakin's death. This was the final step towards turning the franchise into a \"Saga.\"\n\nIn 1994, Lucas began writing the first screenplay, titled ''Episode I: The Beginning''. At first the plan was to write and then film all three prequels at once, but this was changed, possibly because the writing process took much longer than first thought. Although Lucas initially planned on having others write and direct, he kept writing on his own, and eventually decided to direct the film as well. In 1999, Lucas announced he would be directing the next two films as well, and began working on Episode II at that time. The first draft of this was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales, a writer from ''The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles'', to polish his draft. Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film ''Jar Jar's Big Adventure''. By now the backstory had undergone large changes&mdash;Ben Kenobi had discovered Anakin as an adult in Episode I's first draft, but he was changed to be a young student, and Anakin a child, and in Episode II the Clone Wars were decided to be a personal manipulation of Palpatine's. At the time of the original trilogy, Lucas had many ideas for this war: in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' it was decided that Lando was a clone and came from a planet of clones that caused a war, but later a different version was decided wherein \"Shocktroopers,\" including Boba Fett, waged war against the Republic from a distant galaxy but were then repelled by the Jedi Knights.\n\nLucas began working on Episode III even before ''Attack of the Clones'' was released, offering concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven Clone War battles. As he reviewed the storyline that summer, however, he says he radically re-organized the plot. Michael Kaminski, in ''The Secret History of Star Wars'', offers evidence that issues in Anakin's fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make massive story changes, first revising the opening sequence to have Palpatine kidnapped and Dooku killed by Anakin as a first act towards the dark side. Lucas' first draft was written in 2003, and is largely similar to the film, though much simplified. After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin's character, rewriting his entire turn to the dark side&mdash;he would now turn out of a quest to save Padm\u00e9 from dying, rather than the previous version where that was one of many reasons and genuinely believed that the Jedi were evil and plotting to take over the Republic. This fundamental rewrite was accomplished through editing and many new and revised scenes filmed in additional pick-ups in 2004.\n\nGeorge Lucas has often exaggerated the amount of material he had written for the series, most of these exaggerations stemming from the post-1978 period where the film grew into a true phenomenon. Lucasfilm often indicated that he had written twelve stories to be filmed, and Lucas was quick to tell how ''Star Wars'' was always Episode IV that was meant as a middle chapter. Lucas also began to claim that Darth Vader's parentage of Luke and redemption was always a major part of his plan from early on, and even that this was his very first script or treatment. As Jonathan Rinzler and Michael Kaminski show, this is demonstrably false. Kaminski rationalizes that these exaggerations are part publicity device and part security measure&mdash;with the series and story radically changing throughout the years, Lucas would emphasize that its current embodiment was the original intention; with the series previously existing as different and often contradictory forms, this makes audiences view the material only from the perspective that Lucas wishes them to view the material, and it also may protect against outrage that such a popular storyline was being changed post-release after being cherished by so many.\n\nInformation on the screenplays comes from many sources. Most of the drafts of ''Star Wars'' were leaked to the public in 1977 and have circulated since then. 1987's [[Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays|''Annotated Screenplays'']] thoroughly documented the early drafts of the trilogy, and Rinzler's ''The Making of Star Wars'' supplemented this info with even more detail, including drafts which had not yet been publicly leaked, as well as Lucas' personal notes. Information on the prequel scripts is comparatively more scarce, but a number of making-of books give insight into the writing process and early drafts. The prequels' drafts are largely similar to the final films due to Lucas exploring ideas in the art department rather than on paper.\n\n====''The Phantom Menace''====\n[[File:EPI_TPM_poster.png|thumb|left|200px|Poster art for ''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]\nIn 1994, George Lucas began writing his prequel trilogy, which was to be made in the coming years. In 1997, production for [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] began. Lucas would revisit Tunisia, Africa and have more problems there as his ''Star Wars'' past came to haunt him. However, this time Lucas filmed all non-location photography in [[Leavesden Studios]], England.\n\nAfter wrapping up filming, Lucas started finishing the special effects and other small things. This would eventually be his last film filmed on regular film. Meanwhile, while Lucas was wrapping up his film, the first ''Star Wars: Celebration'' took place, which celebrated the release of Episode I and would recur for Episodes II and III.\n\nAfter his film was released on May 19, [[1999]], Lucas soon started writing Episode II while ''The Phantom Menace'' broke box-office records and grossed more than 900 million dollars worldwide, despite poor reviews and reaction to the acting and general appearance of characters, in particular the much-maligned [[Jar Jar Binks]].\n\n====''Attack of the Clones''====\n[[File:Attack-Clones-Poster.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Poster art for ''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]\nFilming for [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] started at Fox Studios, Sydney, Australia with new actors like [[Hayden Christensen]] and the return of the now-famous Ewan McGregor and [[Natalie Portman]] along with a fully digitized Yoda.<ref name=\"encore\" />\n\nHowever, when the film was released, many people criticized Lucas's love scenes and dialogue as well as Hayden's portrayal of a \"whiny\" Anakin. It became the first ''Star Wars'' film not to be the top-earning film of the year, placing only fourth globally (second to ''Spider-Man'' in North America).\n\n====''Revenge of the Sith''====\n[[File:EPIII_RotS_poster.png|thumb|left|200px|Poster art for ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]\nIn late 2002, Lucas began writing the screenplay for his last ''Star Wars'' film, ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'', what would be the darkest ''Star Wars'' film. Anakin turns to the dark side, the [[Jedi Order]] is destroyed and Palpatine becomes Emperor. It would be a heartfelt moment when the last scene was finished and the cast left on their separate ways foreseeable the premiere in May 2005.\n\nThe film received praise from critics as well as fans. ''Revenge of the Sith'' broke midnight, opening, three-day and five-day records, becoming the fastest film to reach $100 million and $300 million. It has so far grossed $848 million and became the second highest grossing film of 2005 in a year of letdowns at the box office.\n\n===Post prequels===\n{{Expand|Development and work on The Clone Wars, rise and fall of Underworld, and assorted Expanded Universe works needs to be reflected}}\n{{Quote|Every one of these movies is a particularly hard nut to crack.

In 2017, Lucasfilm was tasked by Disney to make another attempt at producing live-action television series to bolster its upcoming [[Disney+]] streaming service and compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" />\n\nPresident Kathleen Kennedy's primary objective was to introduce a new era of films with the sequel trilogy. While the films earned billions at the box office, the fluctuating narrative was evident and led to what was known as \"the hiatus,\" a gap in the ''Star Wars'' film planning which was announced in early 2019, months before the closing chapter of the sequel trilogy was released so that Lucasfilm could regroup. Kennedy stated that the company recognized that this time period was a new chapter for the company, and that they all needed to work together to create the architecture for the future. With the ''Star Wars'' anthology films, Lucasfilm had been releasing one film per year, and so Kennedy dissolved the annual deadlines and wanted to reconsider objectives. Kennedy believed that ''Star Wars'' required a greater degree of professional devotion from filmmakers. Kennedy remarked that anyone who went into the ''Star Wars'' universe needed to understand that it was a three to five year commitment, and that it required nurturing. Kennedy felt that in order to prepare for Disney+, their series had to feel as large as the films. As a result Kennedy turned to [[Jon Favreau]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" />\n\n====Creating ''The Mandalorian''====\n{{Quote|With ''The Mandalorian'' on Disney+, we have ushered in an entirely new era for ''Star Wars'', and there is more to come.|Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, at the Disney Investor Day 2020|<ref name=\"Investor 2020 Showcase\">{{DisneyCompany|url=disney-investor-day-2020|text=Disney Investor Day 2020}}</ref>}}\n[[File:TheMandalorianS1Poster.png|thumb|right|220px|''The Mandalorian'' heralded a new age for ''Star Wars'' and Lucasfilm.]]\nFavreau, who had worked with Disney on the ground-breaking visual effects films ''The Jungle Book'' and ''The Lion King'', was always deeply interested in ''Star Wars'' as understood by Kennedy. Favreau had previously starred as a Mandalorian animated character in ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars''. As a result, Favreau was the first person approached by Kennedy for this new era and demonstrated that not only was he interested, but he had an idea. For Kennedy, Favreau met the new criteria of hers, in that his sole focus was being committed to ''Star Wars''. After meeting in Kennedy's office, Favreau began work without even having a contract in place and by the time he was hired he had already written the first four episodes for his series centered around a lone gunslinging Mandalorian. At the same time, Lucasfilm executive [[Dave Filoni]] approached Kennedy, and wanted a series focused on the Mandalorians as he wanted to explore some of the ideas that were never fully realized when developing ''The Clone Wars'' with George Lucas. Filoni began playing a critical role in Lucasfilm's new TV strategies, was indispensable as he channeled George Lucas, and Kennedy had been nurturing his filmmaking ambitions ever since she arrived in 2012.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" />\n\nAlthough Favreau and Filoni were friendly, Kennedy feared that a conflict may rise and arranged a meeting between the two. The two got along instantly, with both exchanging ideas and drawings for a Mandalorian show that could combine their ideas. Filoni's knowledge of Mandalorian history mixed well with the lone gunslinger idea Favreau wanted to develop. They also challenged each other, with Favreau's idea for the Child, [[Din Grogu|Grogu]], being the biggest contention. That gave development some pause, with Filoni having reservations and sketches and concept being created. There were many looks, until [[Christian Alzmann]]'s sketch made everything click. Additionally, Industrial Light & Magic developed the \"Volume\" in 2018, which is a large curved LED wall that can envelop a film crew in a photorealistic digital environment.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" />\n\n[[File:DisneyGalleryTechnology.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The \"Volume,\" developed by ILM for ''The Mandalorian'', revolutionized filmmaking technology for the entire industry.]]\nThe technology was unsteady, but was further refined and in spring of 2018, legendary filmmaker James Cameron visited as he was working on the Avatar sequels nearby. Favreau had the team display on the monitors the test shot done earlier. Cameron approached the Volume and approved of how convincing it was. The Volume allowed Lucasfilm to produce ''The Mandalorian'' in a better cost-effective method, and in half the time of a ''Star Wars'' or Marvel film.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" /> ''The Mandalorian'' debuted in [[November 12]], 2019<ref name=\"Poster Revealed\">{{SW|url=news/the-mandalorian-poster|text=D23 Expo 2019: ''The Mandalorian'' Poster Revealed}}</ref> to critical and commercial success, and further seasons were planned.

There, they asked McGregor if he would like to participate in introducing a new ''Star Wars'' film, and McGregor recalled that he suddenly felt that he really did want to continue being Kenobi. By this time, younger audiences who grew up with the prequel films enjoyed them, and McGregor found himself realizing that he enjoyed playing Obi-Wan. Around this time, McGregor was commonly asked if he would ever consider playing Obi-Wan Kenobi in interviews, which he always answered in the affirmative. In 2018, then Vice President of Development at Lucasfilm Kiri Hart asked McGregor if he was genuine and authentic, to which McGregor recalled that he would be happy to perform as Obi-Wan.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" />\n\n[[File:ObiWanKenobiOfficialPoster.png|thumb|left|215px|''Obi-Wan Kenobi'' released in May 2022 on Disney+, and focused on the classic character.]]\nAt first, the project was to develop the new Obi-Wan Kenobi story as film, to be directed [[Stephen Daldry]] and McGregor executive producing. The film then transformed into an Obi-Wan TV series to serve as part of Lucasfilm's new initiatives for the Disney+ streaming service. At that time, Daldry departed and [[Deborah Chow]], a director from ''The Mandalorian'', joined the development for the series to keep it in authentically cinematic scope. In the early drafts of the story, Darth Vader was not included, which brought a common debate at Lucasfilm: How much should legacy characters be used and how much should they be kept in reserve? When developing the story, Lucasfilm debated whether introducing Vader to a story regarding Obi-Wan after ''Revenge of the Sith'' would take away from their meeting in ''A New Hope'' or if it would enhance that moment. ''Kenobi'' producer and Senior Vice President of Live Action Development and Production [[Michelle Rejwan]] stated that these discussions are always held.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" />\n\nIn fall 2019, Director Chow visited Anakin Skywalker actor Hayden Christensen about returning to ''Star Wars'' as Vader, to which he eventually agreed. While Chow advocated for a rematch between Vader and Kenobi,<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" /> reportedly at the behest of Dave Filoni,<ref name=\"Filoni Kenobi\">{{WebCite|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2022/03/dave-filoni-fought-hayden-christensend-vader-al1|text=Dave Filoni Fought Disney to Bring Hayden Christensen Back as Darth Vader|author=Lue, Alex|date=2022-03-12|work=[https://insidethemagic.net Inside the Magic]|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/AJXTO}}</ref> Lucasfilm's Story Group debated on whether to go that route. As a result, soundstages that were reserved in England were canceled, and the story was internally scrutinized further, resulting in fears from fans that the show may be canceled. In March 2020, the decision for Vader to return in ''Obi-Wan Kenobi'' was finalized.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2022\" />\n\n====Exploring the contemporary====\n[[File:Andor_Promotional_Banner.png|thumb|280px|''Andor'' explored the time of Andor before ''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story''.]]\nAround 2019, ''Rogue One'' actor [[Diego Luna]], who played the Rebel Alliance [[spy]] [[captain]] [[Cassian Jeron Andor]], received a call from [[Tony Gilroy]], who modified ''Rogue One''{{'s}} script for reshoots, while Luna was in Mexico City.

It is alluding to the classic fairy tale line \"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away&hellip;\" and variations thereof. It may reflect that the films are to be interpreted as the myths of the future, as opposed to literally meaning that the events take place in the past. Lucas himself intentionally left the details open to interpretation.<ref name=\"Archive\">{{SWArchive|url=community/askjc/steve/askjc20000515.html|text=Ask the Lucasfilm Jedi Council - May 15, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe saga shows an \"ancient\" galactic civilization thousands of years old. The setting is totally unrelated to [[Wikipedia:Earth|Earth]], the [[Wikipedia:Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]] or reality, which gives it more liberty, in a sense. The ''Star Wars'' galaxy prominently features humans that look like those from Earth. Their civilization was able to develop space travel, terraform, build [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopoleis]], and build space colonies 200,000 years \"ago,\" according to the Expanded Universe.\n\nThe titular '''''Star Wars''''' originally referred to the [[Galactic Civil War]] which takes place in the [[original trilogy]]. However, when considering the prequels (focusing on the [[Invasion of Naboo]] and the [[Clone Wars]]), the sequels (depicting the [[First Order-Resistance War]]) and the Expanded Universe, these events are only a portion of the millennia-spanning war between the Sith and the [[Jedi]]/Galactic Republic.\n\n''Star Wars'' also merges science with supernatural elements that strongly relate to epic stories and fairy tales (e.g., [[The Force|magic]], knights, [[Witches of Dathomir|witches]], princes, and \"whimsical\" alien races such as Ewoks, [[Wistie]]s, etc.).\n\nWhile the scope of [[Timeline of galactic history/Legends|''Star Wars'' history]] spans many thousands of years among all of the ''Star Wars'' history recorded and over 36,100 years in all the fiction produced to date (from [[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi|''Dawn of the Jedi'']] to ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]''), the films span only two generations.\n\nLater novels from a series dubbed [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|''The New Jedi Order'']] opened up the ''Star Wars'' setting with alien beings known as the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] that came from a different galaxy, much to the surprise of some fans. Nearly all species and events prior to this series considered only one single galaxy.\n\n==Franchise==\n===Films===\n{{Quote|I've never seen the movies as any kind of phenomenon because I have to live with them and work with them and they're just another movie that I make.

The original ''Star Wars'' movie (''Episode IV'') was first released in 1977, but the novelization was released six months earlier, in 1976. The sixth ''Star Wars'' film (''Episode III'') was released in [[2005]]. There were originally to be nine films in three trilogies (some accounts claim twelve films in four trilogies); however, Lucas has stated that he does not intend to make any more ''Star Wars'' films after ''Episode III''.\n\nOn October 30, 2012, The Walt Disney Company, along with the announcement of the acquisition of Lucasfilm, announced plans for the production of a new series of films, beginning with ''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'' in 2015, and plans for additional films. George Lucas announced he would not be directing the films but would serve as a creative consultant.\n\nAll of the original films were shot at, among other locations, Elstree Studios. ''Episode I'' was filmed at Leavesden Studios and the subsequent prequels were filmed in [[Wikipedia:Sydney|Sydney]], [[Wikipedia:Australia|Australia]].

For the [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Editions]] of Episodes IV through VI, the films were extensively cleaned up and restored, and Lucas took this opportunity to make a number of [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|changes]], adding previously cut scenes and new effects. The Special Editions were released in theaters in early [[1997]], and on [[Wikipedia:VHS|VHS]] later that year. Further changes were made for the films' initial [[Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)|DVD release]] in September [[2004]]. In [[2006]], Lucas finally released the original trilogy in [[Original unaltered trilogy|unaltered form]] on DVD.\n\nAt a [http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/ShoWest_Convention_USA ShoWest convention] in 2005, George Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he was planning to release all six films in a new 3D film format, beginning with ''A New Hope'' in 2007. This did not materialize, but on [[September 28]], [[2010]], StarWars.com announced the 3D release of ''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' coming to theaters in 2012.\n\nDespite the Disney's 2012 purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the release rights to all future ''Star Wars'' films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to ''A New Hope'', which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through May 2020, at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.<ref name=\"Hollywood Reporter\">{{WebCite|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tangled-rights-could-tie-up-384541|text=Tangled Rights Could Tie Up Ultimate 'Star Wars' Box Set (Analysis)|author=Masters, Kim|date=2012-10-30|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|''The Hollywood Reporter'']]|archivedate=20200215125918}}</ref> On December 14, 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced that it is acquiring most of Fox's parent company, [[Wikipedia:21st Century Fox|21st Century Fox]], including the film studio and all distribution rights to ''A New Hope''.<ref name=\"Acquire\">{{DisneyCompany|url=walt-disney-company-acquire-twenty-first-century-fox-inc-spinoff-certain-businesses-52-4-billion-stock-2|text=The Walt Disney Company To Acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., After Spinoff Of Certain Businesses, For $52.4 Billion In Stock}}</ref>\n\n===Expanded Universe===\n[[File:SOTME_Cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'']]\n{{Main|Star Wars Legends}}\nThe Expanded Universe (or EU) is the continuation of the movies. It plays a major role in the storyline. One can read books from the prequel era, between the movies, or post-Episode VI. There are also several books dealing with the lives of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] just before the movies. There are even books about the briefly shown [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]]. Some notable characters within the EU include the twins [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]] and [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], former [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hand]] Mara Jade, the pilot-turned-Jedi [[Corran Horn/Legends|Corran Horn]], and the tactical genius Grand Admiral Thrawn.\n\nThe books set during or after the ''Star Wars'' original trilogy follow [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], Princess Leia, Han Solo, and other minor characters, as well as the growth of the New Republic. ''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'' by [[Kathy Tyers]] is the first book chronologically set after ''Return of the Jedi'', but the first Expanded Universe story written was Alan Dean Foster's ''Splinter of the Mind's Eye''.\n\nWriters in the Expanded Universe often gave context to details in the movies, for example explaining that the absence of non-humans shown in the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] (compared to the numbers in the Rebellion) was because most Imperials were [[Wikipedia:Xenophobia|xenophobic]].\n\n===Story===\nThe earliest Expanded Universe stories chronologically are those in ''Dawn of the Jedi''. Novels such as the [[Star Wars: Darth Bane Trilogy|''Darth Bane Trilogy'']], ''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]'', and [[Knight Errant (novel)|''Knight Errant'']] feature both the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire.\n\nThousands of years later, series about the training of Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Naboo Crisis introduce the characters and situations that form the backbone of the story told in the films. The story then revolves around the [[Skywalker family/Legends|Skywalker family]] and their friends and adversaries. The Skywalkers are involved in every important event from that point forward. They go through numerous wars, the last known being [[Cade Skywalker]] and the [[Second Imperial Civil War]].\n\n===Radio adaptation===\n[[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'']], the NPR radio adaptation (1981), was followed by adaptations of the next two films of the series. These adaptations were written by science-fiction author [[Brian Daley]], who also wrote three novels detailing the adventures of Han Solo and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] prior to their appearance in ''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope''.\n\n===Related movies===\nThere are six official feature-length works besides the primary films of the three trilogies:\n*''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' ([[1978]])\n*''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'' ([[1984]])\n*''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' ([[1985]])\n*[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']] ([[2008]])\n*''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'' ([[2016]])\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' ([[2018]])\n\nThe first three of these are live-action, and were originally made for TV, though the 1984 [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] film was shown in theaters in some locations outside the U.S. ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' is an animated theatrical feature kicking off the 2008 TV series. ''Rogue One'' and ''Solo'' are live-action standalone films.\n\n[[File:Tv_star_wars_holiday_special_life_day.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chewbacca, along with Luke, Leia, Han, and the droids, celebrates [[Life Day/Legends|Life Day]] by the [[Tree of Life/Legends|Tree of Life]] in ''The Star Wars Holiday Special''.]]\n''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' became famous for featuring Boba Fett's first appearance.

''Ewoks'' featured the adventures of the Ewoks prior to ''Return of the Jedi''. ''Droids'' featured the adventures of [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] between ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope''.\n\n===Live-action TV shows===\nAnimated Series by release order:\n*''[[The Mandalorian]]'' ([[2019]])\n*''[[The Book of Boba Fett]]'' ([[2021]])\n*''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi (television series)|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'' ([[2022]])\n*''[[Andor (television series)|Andor]]'' ([[2022]])\n*''[[Ahsoka (television series)|Ahsoka]]'' ([[2023]])\n*''[[The Acolyte]]'' ([[2024]])\n*[[Star Wars: Skeleton Crew|Skeleton Crew]] ([[2024]])\n\nIn 1984 and 1985, George Lucas executive produced two live-action television episodes of a short series called ''Ewok Adventures''. These take place before the Battle of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] and follow the brief adventures of the Towani family after they are marooned on Endor. The two episodes were named ''Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure'' and ''Ewoks: The Battle for Endor'', and [[Warwick Davis]] returned to once again play the plucky Ewok [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket W. Warrick]]. One odd thing in this series was that Wicket was taught to speak English, an ability he did not reveal at all during ''Return of the Jedi''.\n\nOn November 9, 2017, Disney chairman Bob Iger revealed that a new live-action ''Star Wars'' television series,<ref name=\"New Series\">{{WebCite|url=http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/star-wars-tv-series-disney-streaming-service-1202611408|text=New 'Star Wars' Trilogy in Works With Rian Johnson, TV Series Also Coming to Disney Streaming Service|author=Littleton, Cynthia|date=2017-11-09|work=[[Wikipedia:Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]|archivedate=20210513181001}}</ref> ''The Mandalorian'',<ref name=\"The Mandalorian FB\">{{Facebook|username=jonfavreau|url=jonfavreau/photos/a.437300899719695/1871991379583966|name=Jon Favreau|date=October 3, 2018|quote=#StarWars #TheMandalorian|archivefile=File:Jon_Favreau_The_Mandalorian.png}}</ref> was to be released on Disney, its new streaming service set to launch in 2019.<ref name=\"New Series\" />\n\nAlongside ''The Mandalorian, ''there are also several other ''Star Wars'' television projects in development for Disney+, including the television series ''Obi-Wan Kenobi'', [[Andor (television series)|''Andor'']], and ''The Acolyte'' by Leslye Headland, the creator of ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series) Russian Doll]''.<ref name=\"Taika\">{{SW|url=news/taika-waititi-announce|text=Academy Award Winner Taika Waititi to Direct and Co-Write new ''Star Wars'' Feature Film For Theatrical Release; Oscar Nominee Krysty Wilson-Cairns to Co-Write Screenplay with Waititi}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of books}}\n''Star Wars''&ndash;based fiction predates the release of the first movie, with the [[Star Wars: A New Hope (novelization)|novelization of ''A New Hope'']] (by Alan Dean Foster but credited to George Lucas) released some months before the film itself. Foster also wrote the first original ''Star Wars'' novel, ''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'', the 1978 publication of which inaugurated a very successful literary spin-off franchise.\n\nThe six ''Star Wars'' movies have provided a basis for over a hundred novels. The novels have been authorized by Lucasfilm, and were previously published by Bantam Books (with a few early titles published by Ballantine), though Del Rey now holds the contract again. The stories told in these books reach back thousands of years before ''The Phantom Menace'' to several generations after ''Return of the Jedi''. Books authorized by Lucas are written by fans of the films, and are part of a collection known as Expanded Universe. The first books considered to be part of the Expanded Universe began to appear in the late 1970s.\n\nMost of the novels that have been written take place after the events of the films, with a few that take place between the movies, and a growing number set before the films. For some fans, these can be more exciting stories, as they provide narratives for many characters who only have a minor roles, or are only briefly seen, in the movies. One of particular note is Steve Perry's ''Shadows of the Empire'', which is set between ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi''. In addition to focusing on relatively minor characters, it bridges some events between the two films.\n\nAlso, a few elements first introduced in the Expanded Universe were later included in the films. Such include [[Coruscant]] and [[Aayla Secura]].\n\nAside from books providing narratives, there are also reference books which detail things about the ''Star Wars'' universe in a nonfiction style, revealing details that cannot fit into a story. Examples include ''[[The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide]]'', ''[[Inside the Worlds of]]'', and the [[Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary|''Visual Dictionaries'']].\n\n===Comic books and strips===\n{{See also|Star Wars comic books}}\n[[File:SWEMP16-FC.jpg|thumb|185px|[[Star Wars: Empire]] to the Last Man cover]]\n[[Marvel Comics]] published adaptations of the original trilogy as well as a ''Star Wars'' comic book series which lasted from 1977 to [[1986]], a total of 107 issues and 3 annuals. A wide variety of creators worked on this series, including [[Archie Goodwin]], [[Howard Chaykin]], [[Al Williamson]], [[Carmine Infantino]], [[Walter Simonson]], [[Michael Golden]], [[Chris Claremont]], [[Whilce Portacio]], [[Mary Jo Duffy]], and [[Ron Frenz]]. In the 1980s, as part of their [[Star Comics]] line oriented towards young children, Marvel also published the short-lived series [[Ewoks (Marvel)|''Ewoks'']] and [[Star Wars: Droids (1986)|''Droids'']], based on the Saturday-morning cartoons.\n\n''Star Wars'' was also a [[Star Wars (comic strip)|daily newspaper comic strip]] from [[1979]] to 1984, written for the bulk of its run by Archie Goodwin and drawn by Al Williamson.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, Dark Horse Comics has published a large number of original adventures set in the ''Star Wars'' universe. As of 2006, these mainly include ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'', ''Star Wars: Empire'', ''[[Star Wars Tales]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Jedi]]'', [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (comic series)|''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'']], and ''Star Wars: Legacy''. Dark Horse has also published collections of the Marvel series in seven volumes and the comic strip as ''Classic Star Wars''.\n\n===Games===\nSince 1983, over 120 [[video game]]s have been published bearing the name of ''Star Wars'', beginning with ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'', published for the [[Wikipedia:Atari 2600|Atari 2600]] by [[Parker Brothers]].\n\nThe first games based on the franchise were released on the Atari 2600. In the first, The Empire Strikes Back (1982), the player drove a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth, destroying AT-AT walkers. While simplistic, the game captured the essence of the movie as well as technology allowed. Several other games appeared, like ''Return of the Jedi: Death Star Battle'' (1982), where the player controlled the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] in a mission to destroy the second Death Star, and ''Jedi Arena'' (1983), the first game to attempt to simulate a lightsaber battle (in this case, clearly inspired by the scene in ''A New Hope'', where Luke Skywalker trains with a seeker). Also in 1983, ''Star Wars'' was released, based on ''A New Hope''. In this game the player takes on the role of Luke Skywalker towards the end of the film in which Luke battles through many TIE fighters in an attempt to destroy the first Death Star.\n\nDue to the video-game crash of 1983, which killed the home-console market, no further games based on the franchise were released until 1991, when the platformer ''Star Wars'' was released for both the NES and Game Boy, and one year later, ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' reused the engine with the plotline of the fifth episode of the saga. It would be still in 1992 that ''Super Star Wars'' was released for the SNES (the Super prefix was often used in remakes of 8-bit games), followed by the remaining games in the trilogy: ''Super Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back'' (1993) and ''Super Star Wars: Return of Jedi'' (1994).\n\nOther early titles include the game [[Star Wars (1991 video game)|''Star Wars'']] for the [[Wikipedia:Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System]] (published by [[JVC]]) and three other titles for the Atari 2600.\n\nVideo game pioneer [[Atari]] produced arcade games based on the original trilogy, beginning with [[Star Wars: The Arcade Game|''Star Wars'']] and [[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (video game)|''The Empire Strikes Back'']], which were both [[Wikipedia:flight simulator|flight-simulator]]-style games that utilized [[Wikipedia:vector graphics|vector graphics]]. The third, ''Return of the Jedi'', used more traditional [[Wikipedia:raster graphics|raster graphics]] and a \"3/4\" perspective.\n\n''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'' (1993) was the first PC game of the \"new generation\" of games released by [[LucasArts]]. It returns to the space-fighter combat gameplay not seen since the Atari arcade games. Players generally played as a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] for the Rebel Alliance, completing a variety of goals, culminating in the destruction of the Death Star. This game had sequels, in the form of ''[[Star Wars: TIE Fighter]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance]]''.\n\nThe longest running series of computer games is the groundbreaking [[Dark Forces/Jedi Knight|''Dark Forces'']] series. This [[Wikipedia:First person shooter|first person shooter]] series began in 1995 with ''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces]]''. The next in the series was ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]'', which allowed the player to play as a Jedi. The third game in the ''Dark Forces'' series, ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast]]'', focused more on a third-person Jedi adventure than the previous games. And the fourth and last release was ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'', which originated as an expansion pack for ''Jedi Outcast'', but evolved into a game of its own.\n\n[[File:RogueSquadronNintendo.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Star Wars Rogue Squadron N64 box cover]]\nAnother long-running video-game series began with [[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (video game)|''Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'']] for the [[Wikipedia:Nintendo 64|Nintendo 64]] and continued in ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]'' for the [[Wikipedia:Nintendo GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]]. The first title was also available for PCs, and all were developed by [[Factor 5]] and published by LucasArts. ''Rogue Squadron III'' featured emulated versions of the original Atari ''Star Wars'' [[Arcade game/Legends|arcade games]].\n\n''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'', published in 2003, won \"Game of the Year\" recognition from several prominent gaming magazines, websites, etc. A sequel, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', was released for the [[Wikipedia:Xbox|Xbox]] in December of 2004 and the PC in February of 2005. Bioware released a MMORPG sequel to ''Knights of the Old Republic'' I and II called ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' on December 20, 2011, set approximately 300 years after the events of ''Knights of the Old Republic II''.\n\n''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', an MMORPG developed by [[Sony]], was released on June 26, 2003 in the United States, November 7 in Europe, December 23, 2004 in Japan, and in 2006 in Australia. The game was set after the events of the Battle of Yavin, and allowed players to create characters of a variety of species and specializations (such as Bounty Hunter and Smuggler) and choose to ally themselves with the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire.\n\n''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' was released in 2004 and is a first-/third-person shooter game capable of online play where you can play in both trilogies, as all factions, in many different battlefields. Its sequels, ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'', ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron]]'', were released in 2005, 2007, and 2009 respectively.\n\n''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'' is a tactical shooter computer game featuring the elite commandos of Delta Squad and set during the Clone Wars. It was released on March 1, 2005.\n\n''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Real-time strategy|real-time strategy]] game, was developed by Petroglyph Games and released on February 16, 2006, and an expansion pack, ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption]]'', was released in 2007.\n\n[[LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game|''LEGO Star Wars'']] is a LEGO spinoff series in which the characters of ''Star Wars'' and most other vehicles and objects are made of LEGO bricks. The second game of the series is ''[[LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]''. The third game of this series, ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', combines the first two games. ''[[LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]'' is a LEGO version of the ''Clone Wars'' animated series, taking place during seasons 1 and 2.\n\nThree role-playing games set in the ''Star Wars'' universe have been published: a d6-based game from [[West End Games]], a [[Wizards of the Coast]] game using the d20 system on which their popular ''Dungeons & Dragons'' is based, and a game from [[Fantasy Flight Games]].\n\n==Cast and crew==\nThe cast of the movies feature notable actors, such as [[Sofia Coppola]] and [[Keisha Castle-Hughes]]. Notable supporting roles played by acclaimed actors include Alec Guinness, [[Peter Cushing]], [[Christopher Lee]] and [[Oliver Ford Davies]]. In the prequel trilogy, professional models did the non-speaking minor-character roles.\n\n==Themes==\nThe central theme of ''Star Wars'' is letting go. George Lucas believes that to be happy, one should accept all the happenings of reality and be compassionate by wholly letting go of their selfishness&mdash;including the fear of losing what one loves, which is an indicator of greed&mdash;to be more selfless.<ref name=\"Archives123\">''[[The Star Wars Archives: Episodes I\u2013III, 1999\u20132005]]''</ref>\n\n''Star Wars'' stresses the self-destructive nature of anger and hate, summed up in Yoda's words ({{Audio|Yoda_fear.ogg|\"Fear is the path to the dark side: fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering\"}}) as well as placing one's feelings for certain people aside. For example, Luke Skywalker is told to remain on [[Dagobah]] to complete his training rather than rescue his friends from Cloud City, because doing so will \"destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.\"\n\nLucas has identified the idea of a democracy becoming a dictatorship as the fundamental idea of the saga. He has stated that the saga raises such ideas as the people giving up their power in desperation, and betrayal by their leaders who may think they are doing the right thing while sacrificing freedom. In this way, ''Star Wars'' is a cautionary tale in which Lucas, by his own admission, warns people of the danger that is always present to democracy and freedom and has been demonstrated throughout history.\n\nThere appear to be anti-technological messages in the films: the primitive Ewoks defeating technological adversaries, and the general idea of technology opposed to humanity, fitting with Lucas' vision. Lucas explicitly attributed the Ewoks' defeat of the Galactic Empire to the exploits of the Vietnamese National Liberation Front (otherwise known as the Vietcong) that operated during the Vietnam War, and also implied in his 1973 draft that the Rebels were similar representations of said theme in the original film.<ref name=\"Nixonian gangsters\">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>\n\nThe main story arc in the films traces the rise, fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker, mirrored by political events occurring on a galactic scale. As Anakin is seduced by the dark side, the Republic slides into despotism and war; when Anakin reclaims the Jedi values of peace and justice, the evil Empire that supplanted the Republic is overthrown by the Rebel Alliance.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{ScrollBox|content=\n{{Reflist}}\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SW|url=|text=Official Site}}\n*{{Facebook|username=starwars|name=Star Wars}}\n*{{Instagram|username=starwars|name=Star Wars}}\n*{{Tumblr|subdomain=starwars|name=Star Wars}}\n*{{Twitter|username=starwars|name=Star Wars}}\n*{{YouTube|channel=starwars|name=Star Wars}}\n*{{WP|Star Wars|''Star Wars''}}\n*{{IMDb|title/tt0076759}}\n*{{IndyWiki}}\n\n{{Star Wars}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|bg=\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0438\n|ca=La guerra de les gal\u00e0xies\n|da=Star Wars\n|de=Star Wars\n|el=Star Wars\n|es=Star Wars\n|fa=\u062c\u0646\u06af \u0633\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0646\n|fi=T\u00e4htien sota\n|fr=Star Wars\n|ga=Star Wars\n|hr=Zvjezdani Ratovi\n|hu=Csillagok h\u00e1bor\u00faja\n|is=Stj\u00f6rnustr\u00ed\u00f0\n|it=Star Wars\n|ja=\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\n|ka=\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10e1\u10d9\u10d5\u10da\u10d0\u10d5\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8 \u10dd\u10db\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\n|ko=\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc6cc\uc988\n|la=Star Wars\n|no=Star Wars\n|pl=Gwiezdne wojny\n|pt=Star Wars\n|sl=Vojna zvezd\n|sr=Zvezdani ratovi\n|sv=Star Wars\n|tr=Star Wars\n|uk=\u0417\u043e\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0456 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\n|zh=\u661f\u969b\u5927\u6230\n}}\n\n[[Category:Real-world terms]]\n[[Category:Star Wars]]",
    "plain_text": "mprot\nGeorge Lucas\nStar Wars is a multi-genre mythology and multimedia franchise created by George Lucas in 1976. Comprising movies, novels, comics, video games, toys, and numerous television series, the Star Wars franchise employs archetypal motifs common to religions, classical mythology, and political climax, as well as musical motifs of those same aspects.\nAs one of the foremost examples of the space opera subgenre of science fiction, Star Wars has become part of mainstream popular culture, as well as being one of the highest-grossing series of all time.\nIn 2012, The Walt Disney Company bought the rights to the franchise from George Lucas for 4.05 billion dollars. Since then, Disney has split off Star Wars into two main categories, those being Star Wars Legends and Star Wars Canon, with Canon being the \"official\" story of the franchise.\nThe catalyst of the multimedia franchise was the release of its mainline story, officially known as the Skywalker Saga; a collection of 9 films released from the years 1977 to 2019, with the first and last release of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope and Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, respectively. Despite the sagas ending, the franchise still continues strong, mainly due to the success of Disney+ original television series, both live-action, such as The Mandalorian, and animated, such as Star Wars: The Bad Batch, as well as publishing projects such as Star Wars: The High Republic'.\n\n\u2022 Overview\n\non Hoth]]\nRoger Ebert\nThe Star Wars story has been presented in a series of American films, which have spawned a large quantity of books and other media, which have formed the Expanded Universe. The Star Wars mythos is also the basis of many toys and games of varying types. The films and novels employ common science-fiction motifs.\nWhereas Gene Roddenberrys Star Trek, a science fantasy franchise that has enjoyed long-lasting popularity in American popular culture, and often combines magical/supernatural elements with a rational and progressive approach to storytelling, Star Wars' has a strong mythic quality alongside its political and scientific elements.\nUnlike the heroes of earlier space-set sci-fi/fantasy film and TV series, such as Flash Gordon, the heroes of Star Wars are not militaristic types but romantic individualists. College literature professors have remarked that the Star Wars saga, with its struggle between good and evil, democracy and empire, can be considered a national epic for the United States. The film has many visual and narrative similarities to John Fords The Searches', which also provides a clue to the relationship between Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker.\nGeorge Lucas attributed the strong appeal of Star Wars to it being a mythology that takes from thousand-year-old psychological motifs and underpinnings of humanity. Particularly, Lucas saw children as the prime audience for such stories. The Star Wars films show considerable similarity to Japanese Jidaigeki films, as well as Roman mythology. Lucas has stated that his intention was to create in Star Wars a modern mythology, based on the studies of his friend and mentor Joseph Campbell. He has also called the first movies similarity to the film The Hidden Fortress' (Akira Kurosawa) an \"homage.\"\nThe Star Wars films portray a world full of grime and technology that looks like it has been used for years, unlike the sleek, futuristic world typical of earlier science-fiction films. In interviews, Lucas tells of rubbing the new props with dirt to make them look weatherworn. Lucas may have been inspired by the Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western films of the 1960s, which performed a similar function on the Western many years earlier. It is tempting to speculate that this break from traditional science-fiction film influenced the cyberpunk genre that emerged around 1984.\nLicensed Star Wars novels have been published since the original movie was released in 1977. Although these novels are licensed by Lucas (meaning he shares in the royalties), he retains ultimate creative control over the Star Wars universe, forcing Lucas Licensing to devote considerable ongoing effort to ensuring continuity between different authors works and Lucas films. Occasionally, elements from these novels are adopted into the highest tier of Star Wars canon, the movies. Books, games, and stories that are not directly derived from the nine movies of Star Wars are known as the Extended or Expanded Universe (EU for short). Lucas has said that he does not deeply involve himself in the EU, choosing instead to concentrate mainly on his movies instead of \"&hellip;the licensing world of the books, games and comic books.\"\nThe original (1977) Star Wars (A New Hope) and the first sequel, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), have been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nIn 1978, Lucas sued the creators of Battlestar Galactica for its similarity to Star Wars. The case was dismissed as having no merit in 1980 by a U.S. Federal judge.\nThe mainline story of Star Wars, known as the The Skywalker Saga, ended in 2019 with the release of Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker. However, the Star Wars franchise itself has not ended, and is continuing to move on past the story of the original saga with shows like The Mandalorian and the upcoming project known as the Star Wars: The High Republic.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Original Trilogy\n\n\u2022 Star Wars (A New Hope)\n\nAlthough George Lucas had made a name for himself among some industry insiders for his work at USC, it was not until the release of American Graffiti in August of 1973 that he reached stardom. The film grossed over $115 million at the box office and was dollar-for-dollar the most profitable film in the history of Hollywood at the time. Lucas profit participation in Graffiti' earned him over $7 million. Lucas was now a millionaire and one of the most sought after young directors in the world.\nAlan Ladd, Jr., then the head of Twentieth Century Fox, saw a smuggled print of American Graffiti before it was released in theaters and was determined that Fox was going to be the next studio to profit from Lucas' genius.\n\n\u2022 Influences\n\nMany different influences have been suggested for the Star Wars films by fans, critics, and George Lucas himself. Lucas has said that the plot and characters in the 1958 Japanese film The Hidden Fortress, directed by Akira Kurosawa, was a major inspiration. Additionally, the film influenced Lucas to tell the story of Star Wars from the viewpoint of the humble droids, rather than a major player. It also played a role in the conception of Darth Vader, whose trademark black helmet intentionally resembles a samurai helmet.\nGeorge Lucas has often said that his original idea for the project that evolved into Star Wars was to remake the Flash Gordon movie serials from the 1930s (a \"serial\" is a movie shown in weekly installments of about 10-20 minutes each). The license wasnt available, so Lucas moved on to other ideas, beginning with Akira Kurosawas film The Hidden Fortress and then Joseph Campbells The Hero With a Thousand Faces. Despite the plot changes the Star Wars' films are still bursting with influences from the Flash Gordon movie serials, including the Rebels vs. the Imperial Forces, Cloud City and even the famous \"roll up\" which begins the movie.\nThe second major direction for Star Wars (used in the 1973 synopsis) was to use the Flash Gordon \"vocabulary\" to create an outer-space version of the Samurai films of Akira Kurosawa, primarily Kakushi toride no san akunin (The Hidden Fortress, 1958), Yojimbo (1961) and Tsubaki Sanj\u016br\u014d (Sanjuro, 1962). Joseph Campbells The Hero With a Thousand Faces eventually gave Lucas a third and final major story direction, but many elements from Kurosawas work remain, including the two bickering peasants (who evolved into the droids), and the queen who often switches places with her handmaiden. The Darth Vader-like evil general who has a change of heart at the end wears a kamon (a Japanese family crest) that looks very similar to the Japanese Imperial Crest.\nLucas had already written two drafts of Star Wars when he rediscovered Joseph Campbells The Hero With a Thousand Faces in 1975 (having read it years before in college). This blueprint for \"The Heros Journey\" gave Lucas the focus he needed to draw his sprawling imaginary universe into a single story. Campbell demonstrates in his book that all stories are expressions of the same story-pattern, which he named the Hero's Journey or the monomyth.\nLucas has often cited The Lord of the Rings series as a major influence on Star Wars. Lucas learned from Tolkien how to handle the delicate stuff of myth. Tolkien wrote that myth and fairytale seem to be the best way to communicate morality - hints for choosing between right and wrong - and in fact that may be their primary purpose. Lucas has also acknowledged in interviews that the Gandalf and the Witch-king characters in the Lord of the Rings influenced the Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader characters respectively.\n\n\u2022 Screenplays\n\nThere are many myths surrounding the writing of Star Wars, many perpetuated by Lucasfilm and George Lucas himself. Author Michael Kaminski tried to set the record straight in his book The Secret History of Star Wars, as did Jonathan Rinzler in The Making of Star Wars, both released in 2007.\nLucas' original concept was a swashbuckling space adventure movie. He says \"the film was a good concept in search of a story\". He first tried to have a child buy the rights to remake Flash Gordon, but was unsuccessful.\nIn 1971, United Artists agreed to make American Graffiti and Star Wars in a two-picture contract, though they would reject Star Wars in its early concept stages. Graffiti was made first, and when it was completed in 1973, Lucas set to work on making his space adventure movie. In early 1973, Lucas wrote a short summary called \"The Journal of the Whills,\" which told the tale of the training of apprentice C.J. Thorpe as a \"Jedi-Bendu\" space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.\nFrustrated that his story was too hard to understand, Lucas wrote a 13-page treatment called The Star Wars, which loosely based on the structure of Akira Kurosawas The Hidden Fortress. By 1974, he had expanded the treatment into a rough-draft screenplay, which added elements such as the Sith and the Death Star, and once more had the protagonist as a young boy, named Annikin Starkiller. For the second draft, Lucas made heavy simplifications, and also introduced the young hero on a farm, with his name now Luke rather than Annikin. Luke/Annikins father is still an active character in the story at this point, a wise Jedi knight, and \"the Force\" now became a supernatural power. The next draft removed the father character and replaced him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi, and in 1976 a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography. The film was titled Adventures of Luke Starkiller, as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars. During production, Lucas changed Lukes last name to Skywalker and altered the title to just The Star Wars and finally Star Wars'.\nAt this point, Lucas was thinking of the film as the only entry that would be made&mdash;the fourth draft underwent subtle changes that made it more satisfying as a self-contained film that ended with the destruction of the Empire itself, as the Death Star was said to achieve; possibly this was a result of the frustrating difficulties Lucas had encountered in pre-production during that period. However, in previous times Lucas had conceived of the film as the first in a series of adventures. The second draft contained a teaser for a never-made sequel about \"The Princess of Ondos,\" and by the time of the third draft some months later, Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to make two sequels. Not long after, Lucas met with author Alan Dean Foster and hired him to write these two sequels&mdash;as novels. The intention was that if Star Wars was successful&mdash;and if Lucas felt like it&mdash;the novels could be adapted into screenplays. He had also by this point developed a fairly elaborate backstory&mdash;though this was not designed or intended for filming; it was merely backstory. \"The backstory wasn't meant to be a movie,\" Lucas has said.\nWhen Star Wars was successful, and not just successful but the biggest hit ever made at that time, Lucas decided to use the film as a springboard for an elaborate serial, although he considered walking away from the series altogether. However, Lucas wanted to create an independent filmmaking center&mdash;what would become Skywalker Ranch&mdash;and saw an opportunity to use the series as a financing agent for him. Alan Dean Foster had already begun writing the sequel as a novel, but Lucas decided to disregard that for filming and create more elaborate film sequels; the book was released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye the next year. At first Lucas envisioned an unlimited number of sequels, much like the James Bond series, and in an interview with Rolling Stone in August of 1977 said that he wanted his friends to take a try directing them and giving unique interpretations on the series. He also said that the backstory where Darth Vader turns to the dark side, kills Lukes father and fights Ben Kenobi on a volcano as the Republic falls would make an excellent sequel. Later that year, Lucas hired sci-fi author Leigh Brackett to write \"Star Wars II\" with him. They held story conferences together, and in late November of 1977 Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment called The Empire Strikes Back. The story is very similar to the final film except Darth Vader does not reveal he is Lukes father. In the first draft that Leigh Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke.\nDuring this period, Lucas had now had time to attach a numeric figure to the amount of sequels&mdash;he revealed to Time magazine in March 1978 that there would be twelve films altogether. This was then revealed in the official Star Wars fanclub newsletter, Bantha Tracks. The figure of 12 was likely selected due to its tradition in serial episodes.\nBrackett finished her first draft of The Empire Strikes Back in early 1978; Lucas has said he was disappointed with it, but before he could discuss it with her she had died from cancer. With no writer available, Lucas had to write his second draft himself. Here Lucas finally made use of the \"Episode\" listing in the film&mdash;The Empire Strikes Back was Episode II. As Michael Kaminski argues in The Secret History of Star Wars, the disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions to take the story in. Here he made use of a new plot twist: Darth Vader says he is Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the year-long struggles of the first film, and quickly wrote two more drafts in the same month&mdash;April of 1978&mdash;which both retained the new Vader-as-father plot. He also took this darker ending farther by imprisoning Han Solo in carbonite and leaving him in limbo.\nThis new storyline where Vader was Lukes father had drastic effects on the series. Michael Kaminski argues in his book that it is unlikely that this was a plot point that had seriously been considered before 1978, or even thought of before then, and that the first film was clearly operating under an alternate storyline where Vader was separate from Lukes father; there is not a single reference to the Vader-as-father plot point before 1978. After the second and third drafts of The Empire Strikes Back, where Lucas first introduced this point, he reviewed the new backstory he had now created: Annikin Skywalker is Ben Kenobis brilliant student, has a child (Luke) but is swayed to the dark-side by the Emperor (who was now a Sith and not just a politician), battles Ben Kenobi on the site of a volcano and is wounded but resurrected as Darth Vader; meanwhile, Kenobi hides Luke on Tatooine while the Republic becomes the Empire and Vader has hunted down the Jedi Knights. With this new backstory, Lucas decided to film this as a trilogy&mdash;moving The Empire Strikes Back from Episode II to Episode V in the next draft. Lawrence Kasdan, who had just completed writing Raiders of the Lost Ark', was then hired to write the next drafts, and was helped by additional input from director Irvin Kershner. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer Gary Kurtz saw the film as a more serious and adult film, which was helped by the new, darker storyline, and brought the series far away from the light adventure roots it had existed as only a year earlier.\nLucas had also around this time developed a third trilogy as well, which took place twenty years after Episode VI.\nBy the time of writing Episode VI&mdash;Revenge of the Jedi, as it was then known&mdash;in 1981, much had changed. Making The Empire Strikes Back was stressful and costly, and Lucas personal life was disintegrating. Burnt out and not wanting to make any more Star Wars films, he vowed to be done with the series, as he makes explicit in a May 1983 interview with Time magazine. Lucas 1981 rough drafts of Revenge of the Jedi had Darth Vader competing with the Emperor for possession of Luke&mdash;and in the second script, the \"revised rough draft,\" Vader was turned into a sympathetic character. Lawrence Kasdan was hired to take over once again, and in these final drafts Vader was explicitly redeemed, and finally unmasked. This change in character would provide a springboard for the \"Tragedy of Darth Vader\" storyline in the prequels.\n\n\u2022 Cast and crew\n\nSince most major motion-picture companies no longer had special-effects teams, or they thought the American public was no longer interested in nonrealistic films, George Lucas had to create one from scratch. He eventually put together a team of model makers and special-effects people to create Industrial Light & Magic. The team worked in a run-down part of Van Nuys in a cramped work space that no one liked. Lucas himself bought old equipment for pennies on the dollar.Industrial Light & Magic: Creating the Impossible\nMeanwhile, George Lucas was looking for actors for Star Wars. Lucas had decided to go with a group of unknowns, against the advice of his friend Francis Ford Coppola, who had picked famous stage and screen actors for The Godfather. Hundreds of actors and actresses tried out for the three main roles, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo. Actors like Burt Reynolds and actresses like Jodie Foster tried out for the parts, but Lucas eventually chose 25-year-old Mark Hamill (who had only worked on television) as Luke Skywalker and 19-year-old Carrie Fisher, daughter of Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, as Princess Leia. Initially, Harrison Ford was not eligible for the role of Han Solo because he had worked with Lucas on American Graffiti but eventually swayed Lucas over after helping the other actors and actresses with their lines and got the part.\nAfter casting the initial group, Lucas had to find actors for two of the films droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. ILM had made some quaint remote-controlled robots, but these parts would require living actors. In came three-foot comedian Kenny Baker. Due to his shortness and the fact that kids could not control this heavy machine, he got the part of R2. Anthony Daniels, however, did not want the part of C-3PO until he saw a drawing of C-3PO by Ralph McQuarrie, and he instantly wanted the part and got it. Lucas eventually found Australia native Peter Mayhew, who was over seven feet tall, making him the perfect size for Han Solos furry Wookiee counterpart, Chewbacca. After casting all the characters, Lucas began production on Star Wars in mid-1976.\n\n\u2022 Star Wars comes to life\n\nThe cast and crew of Star Wars began filming in Tunisia, North Africa where mid-morning temperatures reached 105 degrees. Many crew members and cast workers thought the movie was a joke and between problems on props and machinery, during filming Tunisia had their largest rainstorm in many years. Through it all Alec Guinness, the Academy Award&ndash;winning actor who was cast as the wise mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, kept up a positive attitude and inspired the cast. The only silver lining was that after Africa, the team would be filming at a more controlled area, Elstree Studios in London.\nAfter finishing up filming in Africa, the entire cast and crew of Star Wars finally came together to film the action sequences on the Death Star battle station. While this was happening, problems at ILM were far worse than the filming ones. Lucas eventually had to supervise every day at ILM, causing him to nearly have a heart attack. Meanwhile, Fox studios had had enough of George Lucas and his \"kid's movie\" and asked Alan Ladd, Jr. to terminate the project. Instead, Alan told Lucas he had only a few weeks to finish filming or have his movie fail. The last few climactic scenes were finished quickly with Lucas biking from soundstage to soundstage. Eventually, the film was finished, and the process to edit and fix his film began.\n\n\u2022 Problems Star Wars faced\n\nWhen Lucas saw the first cut of his film, he was horrified. To make matters worse, he had to fire his editor. Luckily, his replacements (including his then wife Marcia) greatly improved the film, but Lucas still insisted on reshooting some scenes. This, among other reasons, forced Fox to move the release date from Christmas 1976 to summer 1977. After showing the film without its music score to some of his friends, only Steven Spielberg, who had recently become an A-list director with the release of Jaws, liked it. However, when Fox executives saw it they loved it. With his film cut and most of the sounds for the film completed (and with the help of Ben Burtt), Lucas started to think about his films score. It was Spielberg who recommended John Williams (who had just scored Jaws'). This was considered a gutsy move because thematic scores were out of style at the time, but Lucas went ahead with it.\n\n\u2022 Pre-release\n\nAfter the score was completed, Lucas began to market his picture. However, many people thought it would be a flop, so not many people went with him. One company that did, however, was the toy company Kenner Products, who decided to make a few figures for the release. Eventually, Lucas's film was released on May 25, 1977. It would be a day they would never forget.\n\n\u2022 Success\n\nWhen Star Wars opened, it initially opened at a few theaters. A month after its release, Star Wars played at almost every theater in the country and hundreds worldwide. People, especially children, flocked to see the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia again and again and again. Lines stretched for miles. Kenner, caught up in a vortex, ran out of toys by early fall of the films release. So, the infamous \"Empty Box\" scheme was formed. Foxs stock rocketed up. Merchandise flew off the shelves by the thousands and Lucas became very rich. Star Wars run eventually ended by early 1978 with over 260 million dollars, making it the most successful film in history at that time. It would be re-released over the next 20 years, adding 220 million to its overall total. Currently, it is the second-highest American grossing film of all time (in inflation-adjusted dollars), second only to Gone with the Wind'.\nStar Wars was nominated for 10 Oscars including Best Picture and won 6 of them. But just being nominated for it showed Fox and Lucas, who knew all along, that this was not a \"kids' film.\"\n\n\u2022 The Empire Strikes Back\n\nIn 1978, with George Lucas a millionaire, he began taking his screenplays for Episodes V and VI and turning them into films, as, despite later declarations, he was already developing the idea of a \"trilogy of trilogies\" of which Star Wars would have been only Episode IV.Log Entries In early 1978, Lucas began working on Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. Star Wars was also retitled Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. However, this time Lucas left the Director's Guild, and Irvin Kershner was the new director with Lucas as the producer. Filming began in mid to late 1978 with the snowy planet of Hoth scenes being filmed in Norway. However, during filming, as if a curse, Norway suffered their worst snowstorm in many years. Mark Hamill, who was still recovering from his car accident injuries, filmed in a scene in the snow while the crew stayed in their hotel rooms. After the filming there concluded, the next part of the filming process turned to Elstree Studios.\nSince Lucas wanted this movie to be bigger and more spectacular than Star Wars, more sets were made and new characters were introduced, which included the first black Star Wars character, Lando Calrissian, played by Billy Dee Williams, and a 2-foot puppet named Yoda voiced by Frank Oz. It was also the first time that Han Solo and Princess Leia kissed. But the biggest surprise was Darth Vaders revelation to Luke. A few minutes before shooting that scene, Kershner told Hamill that Vader was Lukes father. To stop the big reveal leaking, David Prowse, the man in the Vader suit, was given a different line to say on set, \"Obi-Wan killed your father.\" When they recorded Vader's dialogue with James Earl Jones, the line was \"No. I am your father.\" This line would later spark the lightsaber duel in Episode VI and all the prequels.\nMany people believed that the sequel would not be as good as Star Wars, but audiences didnt think so. The Empire Strikes Back took in 6.4 million dollars of the weekend of May 21, 1980. It was also considered the darkest Star Wars movie until Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith was released. However, its gross in the U.S. ended at 290 million dollars, making it the lowest-grossing Star Wars' movie.\n\n\u2022 Return of the Jedi\n\n]]\nBefore beginning the production of Episode VI, Lucas, using the profits from Star Wars and Empire, made Skywalker Ranch, a place where friends of Lucas could hang out and work on movies, mostly Star Wars&ndash;related things. It would be used more during the making of the prequel trilogy.\nIn early 1982, Lucas still out of the directors chair, Richard Marquand began shooting Revenge of the Jedi. Some of the new things in the films included a speeder-bike chase, a second Death Star and one of the most controversial groups of characters in Star Wars history, the Ewoks. Also, to keep the title of Episode VI from leaking out, the title Blue Harvest: Horror Beyond Imagination was the working \"title\" of the movie. After filming for Jedi completed, a few months before the films release, Lucas changed the title to Return of the Jedi, stating, \"revenge was not a quality of the Jedi,\" although some industry insiders attribute the titles change to Star Trek II : Wrath of Khan' being released around the same time and Fox, and possibly Lucas, not wanting audiences confused between the similar titles. The \"Revenge\" title would eventually be used for Episode III.\nAfter Jedi broke single- and opening-day box office records on May 25, 1983, six years after the original Star Wars opening, George Lucass wife divorced him, leaving him to raise his children. Afterwards, Lucas established several Lucasfilm companies including THX Sound and Picture, the Pixar Animation Studios (which would later be sold to Disney), and several others. In May 1987, ten years after the first movies release, Lucas announced a second trilogy and hinted at a third. In mid-1996, with all the technology necessary, Lucas began working on the Star Wars movies the way he wanted them, adding new scenes and changes along with THX Sound and excellent picture quality.\n\n\u2022 Growth of the Expanded Universe\n\nBeginning with Splinter of the Mind's Eye, the Star Wars Expanded Universe was populated by a slow trickle of novels, comic strips and television specials.\nAlmost a decade after the release of Return of the Jedi, Star Wars merchandising sales had ground to a halt. In an effort to revitalize interest and capitalize on the success of other franchises in books, Bantam Spectra and Lucas Licensing planned a four-year publication run that would include several Star Wars novels.\nIt was 1991s Heir to the Empire that sparked the success of the first run of new novels and signaled a renaissance in Star Wars publishing. The Thrawn Trilogy by Hugo Award&ndash;winning author Timothy Zahn would become one of the most popular science-fiction series to date, and introduced some of the Expanded Universes best-known characters, like Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade and Gilad Pellaeon. Bantam would continue to publish dozens of books across a number of eras, leading to the use of era markers after Bantam was sold to Del Rey.\nBut books were just the beginning. In the same year as Zahns success, Dark Horse Comics released Star Wars: Dark Empire, the first serious Star Wars' graphic novel. It too would be followed by dozens of comic series.\nStar Wars video and computer games also contributed to the Expanded Universe, but 1996s Shadows of the Empire' multimedia campaign marked a turning point. The simultaneous release of a novel, video game, comics, soundtrack, toys and other promotional tie-ins set the standard that would later be followed for the merchandising efforts of the prequel trilogy and expanded upon for the Clone Wars.\n\n\u2022 Special Editions\n\nIn the 1990s, with ILMs advancement in technology, George Lucas sought to refine his Star Wars' films, and began altering them to in an effort to fulfill his original intentions when creating the films. New scenes were added as a result, although some minor aesthetic changes came to be items of controvery amongst fans. Despite this, some fans praised other changes.\n\n\u2022 Prequel Trilogy\n\nEwan McGregor on the audience reception to prequel trilogy\n\n\u2022 Development\n\nAfter getting a divorce in 1983 and losing much of his fortune, Lucas had no desire to return to Star Wars, and had unofficially canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi. However, the prequels, which were quite developed, remained fascinating to him. After Star Wars became popular once again, in the wake of Dark Horses comic line and Timothy Zahns Thrawn Trilogy novels, Lucas saw that there was still a large audience. His children had begun to grow older, and with the explosion of CG technology, he was now considering returning to directing. By 1993 it was announced, in Variety among other sources, that he would be making the prequels. He began outlining the story, now offering that Anakin Skywalker would be the protagonist rather than Ben Kenobi and that the series would be a tragic one examining his transformation to evil. He also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals&mdash;at first they were supposed to be a \"filling-in\" of history, backstory, existing parallel or tangential to the originals, but now he began to see that they could form the beginning of one long story: beginning with Anakins childhood and ending with Anakins death. This was the final step towards turning the franchise into a \"Saga.\"\nIn 1994, Lucas began writing the first screenplay, titled Episode I: The Beginning. At first the plan was to write and then film all three prequels at once, but this was changed, possibly because the writing process took much longer than first thought. Although Lucas initially planned on having others write and direct, he kept writing on his own, and eventually decided to direct the film as well. In 1999, Lucas announced he would be directing the next two films as well, and began working on Episode II at that time. The first draft of this was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales, a writer from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, to polish his draft. Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film Jar Jar's Big Adventure. By now the backstory had undergone large changes&mdash;Ben Kenobi had discovered Anakin as an adult in Episode Is first draft, but he was changed to be a young student, and Anakin a child, and in Episode II the Clone Wars were decided to be a personal manipulation of Palpatines. At the time of the original trilogy, Lucas had many ideas for this war: in The Empire Strikes Back it was decided that Lando was a clone and came from a planet of clones that caused a war, but later a different version was decided wherein \"Shocktroopers,\" including Boba Fett, waged war against the Republic from a distant galaxy but were then repelled by the Jedi Knights.\nLucas began working on Episode III even before Attack of the Clones was released, offering concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven Clone War battles. As he reviewed the storyline that summer, however, he says he radically re-organized the plot. Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, offers evidence that issues in Anakins fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make massive story changes, first revising the opening sequence to have Palpatine kidnapped and Dooku killed by Anakin as a first act towards the dark side. Lucas first draft was written in 2003, and is largely similar to the film, though much simplified. After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin's character, rewriting his entire turn to the dark side&mdash;he would now turn out of a quest to save Padm\u00e9 from dying, rather than the previous version where that was one of many reasons and genuinely believed that the Jedi were evil and plotting to take over the Republic. This fundamental rewrite was accomplished through editing and many new and revised scenes filmed in additional pick-ups in 2004.\nGeorge Lucas has often exaggerated the amount of material he had written for the series, most of these exaggerations stemming from the post-1978 period where the film grew into a true phenomenon. Lucasfilm often indicated that he had written twelve stories to be filmed, and Lucas was quick to tell how Star Wars was always Episode IV that was meant as a middle chapter. Lucas also began to claim that Darth Vader's parentage of Luke and redemption was always a major part of his plan from early on, and even that this was his very first script or treatment. As Jonathan Rinzler and Michael Kaminski show, this is demonstrably false. Kaminski rationalizes that these exaggerations are part publicity device and part security measure&mdash;with the series and story radically changing throughout the years, Lucas would emphasize that its current embodiment was the original intention; with the series previously existing as different and often contradictory forms, this makes audiences view the material only from the perspective that Lucas wishes them to view the material, and it also may protect against outrage that such a popular storyline was being changed post-release after being cherished by so many.\nInformation on the screenplays comes from many sources. Most of the drafts of Star Wars were leaked to the public in 1977 and have circulated since then. 1987s Annotated Screenplays thoroughly documented the early drafts of the trilogy, and Rinzlers The Making of Star Wars supplemented this info with even more detail, including drafts which had not yet been publicly leaked, as well as Lucas personal notes. Information on the prequel scripts is comparatively more scarce, but a number of making-of books give insight into the writing process and early drafts. The prequels drafts are largely similar to the final films due to Lucas exploring ideas in the art department rather than on paper.\n\n\u2022 The Phantom Menace\n\nIn 1994, George Lucas began writing his prequel trilogy, which was to be made in the coming years. In 1997, production for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace began. Lucas would revisit Tunisia, Africa and have more problems there as his Star Wars past came to haunt him. However, this time Lucas filmed all non-location photography in Leavesden Studios, England.\nAfter wrapping up filming, Lucas started finishing the special effects and other small things. This would eventually be his last film filmed on regular film. Meanwhile, while Lucas was wrapping up his film, the first Star Wars: Celebration took place, which celebrated the release of Episode I and would recur for Episodes II and III.\nAfter his film was released on May 19, 1999, Lucas soon started writing Episode II while The Phantom Menace broke box-office records and grossed more than 900 million dollars worldwide, despite poor reviews and reaction to the acting and general appearance of characters, in particular the much-maligned Jar Jar Binks.\n\n\u2022 Attack of the Clones\n\nFilming for Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones started at Fox Studios, Sydney, Australia with new actors like Hayden Christensen and the return of the now-famous Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman along with a fully digitized Yoda.\nHowever, when the film was released, many people criticized Lucass love scenes and dialogue as well as Haydens portrayal of a \"whiny\" Anakin. It became the first Star Wars film not to be the top-earning film of the year, placing only fourth globally (second to Spider-Man in North America).\n\n\u2022 Revenge of the Sith\n\nIn late 2002, Lucas began writing the screenplay for his last Star Wars film, Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, what would be the darkest Star Wars film. Anakin turns to the dark side, the Jedi Order is destroyed and Palpatine becomes Emperor. It would be a heartfelt moment when the last scene was finished and the cast left on their separate ways foreseeable the premiere in May 2005.\nThe film received praise from critics as well as fans. Revenge of the Sith broke midnight, opening, three-day and five-day records, becoming the fastest film to reach $100 million and $300 million. It has so far grossed $848 million and became the second highest grossing film of 2005 in a year of letdowns at the box office.\n\n\u2022 Post prequels\n\nKathleen Kennedy\n]]\nAfter the completion of the prequels, Lucas began work on various Star Wars projects, including a new Clone Wars animated series, a live-action series, and a 3D conversion of all six films. The Clone Wars debuted in late 2008 and The Phantom Menace was released to theaters in 3D on February 10, 2012. However, the live-action series was put on hold due to budgetary issues.\n\n\u2022 Disney's acquisition and new beginnings\n\n\u2022 The creator's retirement\n\nGeorge Lucas, upon the acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney\nGeorge Lucas announced his retirement from filmmaking on January 2012, stating that the birth of his daughter, his older age relative to the decade he estimated it would take him to produce any potential sequel trilogy, his plans to build a museum, his desire for hands-on control, and his desire to enjoy his life were his motivations. While in New York for The Daily Show, Lucas had lunch with veteran producer and filmmaker Kathleen Kennedy, asking her if she would serve as co-chair of Lucasfilm with the intention of transferring leadership to her entirely after roughly one year. On June 1, 2012, Kennedy began her tenure at Lucasfilm, and Lucas proposed that they begin work on the sequel trilogy. At this time, Lucasfilm began early development on Episodes VII, VIII, and IX, hiring Michael Arndt to begin work on Episode VII with Lawrence Kasdan as a consultant.\nAfter considering directing Episode VII himself, Lucas and his company entered into negotiations with The Walt Disney Company and CEO Robert Iger in June 2012, with negotiations ongoing for five months. Lucas ensured that vital Lucasfilm personnel would remain, and was initially hesitant to lose control over the new Star Wars films but had his fears reassured. Lucasfilm's acquisition was announced on October 30, 2012, for which Disney paid Lucas USD $4.05 billion. As part of the announcement, Disney revealed that it would be producing the sequel trilogy and new films.\n\n\u2022 A fresh start and new developments\n\nOn November 9, 2012, Lucasfilm confirmed that pre-production began on Episode VII, and that Michael Arndt would write the script. Arndt worked on the Episode VII script throughout 2013, and at some point, Lucass story outlines for the sequels were set aside. A writers room was assembled, including Arndt, Kiri Hart, Lawrence Kasdan, Kathleen Kennedy, and Simon Kinberg.\nAs Lucasfilm developed the script for Episode VII, production for two theme park expansions for Disneyland and Walt Disney World centered on Star Wars began in 2013. A new Star Wars animated TV series, Star Wars Rebels, was first announced on March 11, 2013 as an untitled animated series set to replace Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Production had long been underway by May 2013, with the first season finishing pre-production by December of that same year.\nMeanwhile, writing sessions for Episode VII continued for months with little progress. Abrams described these sessions as many ideas and outlines, with \"a lot of cards on the wall, a lot of writing on whiteboards.\" Eventually, Arndt was removed from the project, and Kasdan was asked to co-write a new script with Episode VII director J.J. Abrams in November 2013. By January 2014, Abrams and Kasdan had developed a script, though they were still developing major story elements even after production began in May of that year as they were under immense pressure to deliver the script in a short period of time. Preliminary filming began the previous month, in April.\nBy March 2014, the entire first season of Star Wars Rebels was mapped out, with the series being executive produced by Dave Filoni, Simon Kinberg, and Greg Weisman. On April 25, 2014, Lucasfilm announced that the Expanded Universe of Star Wars would be rebranded as Star Wars Legends effective immediately. At that point, the only Star Wars material that was considered official and current canon was the six original films of the Star Wars saga, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars series, certain material from the StarWars.com website, certain exceptions, and upcoming material. Some content was excluded, and continued to be stories within Star Wars Legends, such as the expansions for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, that were not yet completed. To ensure that all future material was consistent with previous canon storytelling, the Lucasfilm Story Group was created. At this same time, new releases were announced, including new novels and games.\nOn May 22, 2014, Lucasfilm announced that Gareth Edwards and Gary Whitta would develop a stand-alone Star Wars film, the first in the Star Wars Anthology Series. Star Wars Rebels premiered with four shorts on August 11, 2014, with the first two episodes serving as a singular movie titled Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion on October 3. The day prior, on October 2, Lucasfilm confirmed that Disney XD ordered a second season of Rebels. Thirteen more episodes were released, culminated in the season finale on March 2, 2015. Months prior, the first sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens finished principal photography on November 6, 2014.Star Wars\nOn March 12, 2015, Lucasfilm announced that the stand-alone film was titled Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and that it would release in December 16 of the following year. It was also announced that Rian Johnson would write and direct the next film in the Star Wars saga, Episode VIII. Star Wars Rebels Season Two premiered with another TV film consisted of the first two episodes, Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal. The film aired on June 20, 2015. On July 7, 2015, Lucasfilm revealed that Christopher Miller and Phil Lord were directing a second stand-alone film focusing on legendary and classic character Han Solo. Principal photography for Rogue One began in August in London. The rest of the second season of Rebels premiered on October 14 of the same year, with episodes released weekly. The third season of Star Wars Rebels was announced on November 30.\n\n\u2022 New Star Wars cements itself\n\nBy this time, The Force Awakens was widely marketed and promoted ahead of its premier, finally releasing on December 18, 2015. According to industry reports, The Force Awakens had an estimated budget of $200 million USD, ultimately earning $2.069 billion USD by the end of its original theatrical run in early 2016, making it the highest grossing Star Wars film. Soon after, principal photography began on Episode VIII in February. The second season of Star Wars Rebels ended on March 30, 2016, with the episode \"Twilight of the Apprentice.\"\nCelebration Europe was held in London from July 15 to July 17. On July 22, Episode VIII finished principal photography. Keeping with the format, the first two episodes of Rebels Season Three released as a film titled Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow, which released on September 24, 2016. The episodes began airing weekly on October 1. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story released in the United Kingdom on December 15, with the standard release the following day on the 16th of December. Rogue One original release ended in early 2016, with the film grossing $1.056 billion USD globally against a reported $200 million USD budget.\nOn January 23, 2017, the title for Episode VIII of the Star Wars saga was revealed to be The Last Jedi. On March 3, the fourth season of Star Wars Rebels was confirmed, with the third season of ending on March 25 with the two part episode special \"Zero Hour.\" Celebration Orlando, the largest Star Wars Celebration Event with 70,000 participants took place from April 13 to April 16. The event celebrated the 40th Anniversary of Star Wars, with George Lucas, John Williams, and many others appearing to celebrate the occasion along with many panels and events. On April 15, Filoni played the TV film debut of Rebels Season Four, Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore, to Celebration participants. On September 21, 2017, The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson revealed that post-production on the film was complete. The Rebels Season Four film was later released on October 16, with the standard season airing weekly beginning on October 23.\nStar Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi aired on December 15, 2017, although it released earlier in several territories on December 13. The film grossed $1.332 billion USD against a $317 million USD budget until the end of its original release, which ended in early January of 2018. The Last Jedi was critically and universally acclaimed, according to many polling sites and film reviews. It was reported that George Lucas enjoyed the film, calling it \"beautifully made.\" Audience reception was additionally highly positive, although online user-generated reviews, which lacked controlled sampling, contained far more negative scores. The film received significant backlash on social media, dividing the Star Wars fandom and adding to toxicity online.\n\n\u2022 A tumultuous landing\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story was released on May 25, 2018. It was directed by Ron Howard and was written by Jonathan Kasdan & Lawrence Kasdan. The third film in the trilogy, marketed as Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, was released on December 20, 2019. It was directed by Abrams and was written by Chris Terrio & Abrams, from a story by Derek Connolly & Colin Trevorrow and Terrio & Abrams.\n\n\u2022 Theatrical aspirations evaporate\n\nAnother entry in the Star Wars Anthology Series was announced on June 4, 2014 and set to be directed by Josh Trank. It was reported that the film would focus on legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett along with the cadre of bounty hunters from The Empire Strikes Back. The film was scheduled to be announced at a panel in Celebration Anaheim in April 19, 2015, but was instead reorganized to focus on the upcoming Rogue One film. On May 1, 2015, however, Lucasfilm announced that Trank had departed the project on the second Anthology film. Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy remarked that the film was one that Lucasfilm wanted to continue developing further but had been postponed. Solo: A Star Wars Story was moved up to release in 2018, with Tranks film shifting to 2020. In August 17, 2017, it was reported the film would focus on Obi-Wan Kenobi. No film was released in 2020, with Lucasfilm shifting to streaming.\nOn February 6, 2018, Lucasfilm announced that Game of Thrones series creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff were set to write and create a Star Wars film series, and the two confirmed that they would begin work on the project once the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones aired. On August 15, Lucasfilm art director Neil Lamont revealed that a film that featured Tatooine was in development but was canceled.} On February 10, 2019, it was reported that the film series was a trilogy, and that Benioff and Weiss were collaborating with The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson as he made his own Star Wars trilogy. On May 7, Disney announced that the next three Star Wars films would release in 2023, 2025, and 2027. On October 28, it was reported that Benioff and Weiss had exited the project to focus on new projects for Netflix.\n\n\u2022 New Era of Star Wars storytelling\n\n\u2022 Initial attempts\n\nPrior to Disneys acquisition of Lucasfilm, George Lucas was developing Star Wars: Underworld, a live-action Star Wars series with a planned one hundred episodes. The level of quality that Lucas expected, however, proved to be too expensive to produce as a live-action series, and the series was abandoned in 2012. In 2017, Lucasfilm was tasked by Disney to make another attempt at producing live-action television series to bolster its upcoming Disney+ streaming service and compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\nPresident Kathleen Kennedys primary objective was to introduce a new era of films with the sequel trilogy. While the films earned billions at the box office, the fluctuating narrative was evident and led to what was known as \"the hiatus,\" a gap in the Star Wars film planning which was announced in early 2019, months before the closing chapter of the sequel trilogy was released so that Lucasfilm could regroup. Kennedy stated that the company recognized that this time period was a new chapter for the company, and that they all needed to work together to create the architecture for the future. With the Star Wars anthology films, Lucasfilm had been releasing one film per year, and so Kennedy dissolved the annual deadlines and wanted to reconsider objectives. Kennedy believed that Star Wars required a greater degree of professional devotion from filmmakers. Kennedy remarked that anyone who went into the Star Wars' universe needed to understand that it was a three to five year commitment, and that it required nurturing. Kennedy felt that in order to prepare for Disney+, their series had to feel as large as the films. As a result Kennedy turned to Jon Favreau.\n\n\u2022 Creating The Mandalorian\n\nLucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, at the Disney Investor Day 2020\nFavreau, who had worked with Disney on the ground-breaking visual effects films The Jungle Book and The Lion King, was always deeply interested in Star Wars as understood by Kennedy. Favreau had previously starred as a Mandalorian animated character in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. As a result, Favreau was the first person approached by Kennedy for this new era and demonstrated that not only was he interested, but he had an idea. For Kennedy, Favreau met the new criteria of hers, in that his sole focus was being committed to Star Wars. After meeting in Kennedys office, Favreau began work without even having a contract in place and by the time he was hired he had already written the first four episodes for his series centered around a lone gunslinging Mandalorian. At the same time, Lucasfilm executive Dave Filoni approached Kennedy, and wanted a series focused on the Mandalorians as he wanted to explore some of the ideas that were never fully realized when developing The Clone Wars with George Lucas. Filoni began playing a critical role in Lucasfilms new TV strategies, was indispensable as he channeled George Lucas, and Kennedy had been nurturing his filmmaking ambitions ever since she arrived in 2012.\nAlthough Favreau and Filoni were friendly, Kennedy feared that a conflict may rise and arranged a meeting between the two. The two got along instantly, with both exchanging ideas and drawings for a Mandalorian show that could combine their ideas. Filonis knowledge of Mandalorian history mixed well with the lone gunslinger idea Favreau wanted to develop. They also challenged each other, with Favreaus idea for the Child, Grogu, being the biggest contention. That gave development some pause, with Filoni having reservations and sketches and concept being created. There were many looks, until Christian Alzmann's sketch made everything click. Additionally, Industrial Light & Magic developed the \"Volume\" in 2018, which is a large curved LED wall that can envelop a film crew in a photorealistic digital environment.\nThe technology was unsteady, but was further refined and in spring of 2018, legendary filmmaker James Cameron visited as he was working on the Avatar sequels nearby. Favreau had the team display on the monitors the test shot done earlier. Cameron approached the Volume and approved of how convincing it was. The Volume allowed Lucasfilm to produce The Mandalorian in a better cost-effective method, and in half the time of a Star Wars or Marvel film. The Mandalorian debuted in November 12, 2019 to critical and commercial success, and further seasons were planned. It was one of the most-watched series in 2019, and received many accolades, being nominated for fifteen Emmy Awards and winning seven. The second season debuted in October 30, 2020 and was nominated for twenty-four Emmy Awards, winning seven. The third season debuted on March 1, 2023.\n\n\u2022 New storytelling revealed\n\nPrior to the launch of The Mandalorian in November 2019, Lucasfilm revealed at the D23 Expo Event in July 2019 that the company was creating Obi-Wan Kenobi, a live-action TV series starring Ewan McGregor returning as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi following the events of Revenge of the Sith. In February 21, 2020, The Final Season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars premiered on Disney+ with twelve episodes culminating in the finales release on May 4.\nGuillermo del Toro had a Star Wars film in production about Jabba the Hutts rise to power, but it was eventually cancelled.Steven Weintraub Announced in Star Wars Celebration Chicago as Project Luminous,Star Wars Celebration Chicago 2019 Live Stream - Day 4 &#124; The Star Wars Show LIVE! Star Wars: The High Republic was revealed in early February 24, 2020 as an expansive multi-media project, spanning novels, comics, audio plays and more, establishing and expanding the High Republic Era set before the events of the prequel films. Split into three phases with three waves each, The High Republic encompasses dozens of story-telling material. A new animated spin-off series of The Clone Wars, Star Wars: The Bad Batch, was announced on July 13, 2020.\nFollowing the success of The Mandalorian and in the midst of The Mandalorian Seasons Twos release, Disney held the Disney Investors Day 2020 event on December 10, showcasing the various future projects across the entire company. Kennedy helmed the section on Lucasfilm for the presentation, revealing a slew of new live-action and animated projects, both films and series. Kennedy announced The Mandalorian spin off series Rangers of the New Republic and Ahsoka, The Acolyte, Lando, A Droid Story, Star Wars: Visions, Rogue Squadron, and a film by Taika Waititi. Only eight days after the Investors Day event on December 18, the finale of the second season of The Mandalorian revealed The Book of Boba Fett, the next chapter in the realm of The Mandalorian stories.\n\n\u2022 Animation lifts off\n\nStar Wars: The Bad Batch premiered on May 4, 2021 with the hour-long episode \"Aftermath.\"Star Wars Starting a season of sixteen episodes, the series focused on Clone Force 99 during the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. On August 5, a second season of The Bad Batch was confirmed. Later that same year on September 22, Star Wars: Visions premiered with nine short anime films, the first Star Wars project in an anime format.\n\n\u2022 The hunter lives on\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett released on December 29, 2021,Star Wars and was centered on the legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett. Initially, prior to The Mandalorian, Lucasfilm planned to feature the bounty hunter in a feature film developed by James Mangold, yet the film was put on hold. Eventually, Favreau and Filoni picked up Boba Fett's story, officially reintroducing the titular bounty hunter in \"Chapter 9: The Marshal\"Chapter 9: The Marshal and fully in \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy,\" with the latter episode directed by Robert Rodriguez.Chapter 14: The Tragedy\nPleased with Rodriguezs direction on the episode, Favreau brought him on board to executive produce The Book of Boba Fett alongside himself and Filoni.Disney Gallery: The Book of Boba Fett Filming reportedly began by late November 2020, and brough titular characters such as Ahsoka Tano and Luke Skywalker,Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger who had appeared in the second season of The Mandalorian'.Chapter 13: The JediChapter 16: The Rescue\n\n\u2022 The Jedi Master returns\n\nIn 2017, Obi-Wan Kenobi actor Ewan McGregor was invited to the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles for a screening of every Star Wars film. There, they asked McGregor if he would like to participate in introducing a new Star Wars film, and McGregor recalled that he suddenly felt that he really did want to continue being Kenobi. By this time, younger audiences who grew up with the prequel films enjoyed them, and McGregor found himself realizing that he enjoyed playing Obi-Wan. Around this time, McGregor was commonly asked if he would ever consider playing Obi-Wan Kenobi in interviews, which he always answered in the affirmative. In 2018, then Vice President of Development at Lucasfilm Kiri Hart asked McGregor if he was genuine and authentic, to which McGregor recalled that he would be happy to perform as Obi-Wan.\nAt first, the project was to develop the new Obi-Wan Kenobi story as film, to be directed Stephen Daldry and McGregor executive producing. The film then transformed into an Obi-Wan TV series to serve as part of Lucasfilms new initiatives for the Disney+ streaming service. At that time, Daldry departed and Deborah Chow, a director from The Mandalorian, joined the development for the series to keep it in authentically cinematic scope. In the early drafts of the story, Darth Vader was not included, which brought a common debate at Lucasfilm: How much should legacy characters be used and how much should they be kept in reserve? When developing the story, Lucasfilm debated whether introducing Vader to a story regarding Obi-Wan after Revenge of the Sith would take away from their meeting in A New Hope or if it would enhance that moment. Kenobi' producer and Senior Vice President of Live Action Development and Production Michelle Rejwan stated that these discussions are always held.\nIn fall 2019, Director Chow visited Anakin Skywalker actor Hayden Christensen about returning to Star Wars as Vader, to which he eventually agreed. While Chow advocated for a rematch between Vader and Kenobi, reportedly at the behest of Dave Filoni, Lucasfilms Story Group debated on whether to go that route. As a result, soundstages that were reserved in England were canceled, and the story was internally scrutinized further, resulting in fears from fans that the show may be canceled. In March 2020, the decision for Vader to return in Obi-Wan Kenobi' was finalized.\n\n\u2022 Exploring the contemporary\n\nAround 2019, Rogue One actor Diego Luna, who played the Rebel Alliance spy captain Cassian Jeron Andor, received a call from Tony Gilroy, who modified Rogue One script for reshoots, while Luna was in Mexico City. There, Gilroy told Luna of his plans for a new series focusing on Andor. Officially revealed in Investors Day 2020, Andor was initially confirmed in November 8, 2018. Filming in London was already underway by December 3, 2020 and wrapped in September 2021. The first season of Andor released at the end of summer in 2022, with production on the second season already underway by May of the same year.\nAlso announced in Investors Day 2020 as a The Mandalorian spin-off series, Ahsoka premiered in August 2023. Revolving around the titular character introduced in The Clone Wars, Ahsoka Tano, the series was written and produced by Dave Filoni. Filoni created the character with George Lucas, and the series focuses on quest to hunt down Grand Admiral Thrawn following her live-action debut in The Mandalorian and later appearing in The Book of Boba Fett. Filoni stated that Star Wars: Ahsoka would be a continuous story that drove toward a goal rather than being singular episodic adventures. Filming for the series began in May 9, 2022.Star Wars\nWith this new era of Star Wars, Lucasfilm will need new actors, characters, and epoch to expand on the current canon timeline. One of these new ventures was the mystery thriller The Acolyte, which is set in the new High Republic Era introduced by the Star Wars: The High Republic multimedia project. The Acolyte Season 1 began airing in June 2024, and concluded airing in July 2024. Leslye Headland had been developing The Acolyte since 2020, prominently within her own home. Another new Star Wars series, under the production title \"Grammar Rodeo,\" is also under development at Lucasfilm and is executive produced by Jon Watts and written by Christopher Ford. The series is described by Lucasfilm as a classic coming-of-age adventure. The Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi series of animated shorts was first announced on at Celebration Anaheim on April 27, 2022.\nCelebration Anaheim commenced on May 26, starting a slew of new announcements and information. \"Grammar Rodeo\" was revealed to be Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, and Andor debuted its first teaser trailer. On May 27, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was officially revealed, along with an accompanying teaser.\n\n\u2022 The future of films\n\nWith Lucasfilms pivot to TV series, the companys theatrical return may be unlikely to follow the relentless releases in the past. President Kathleen Kennedy remarked that the company had a road map for their theatrical projects, with Krysty Wilson-Cairns and Taika Waititis Star Wars film likely being the first to launch, followed by Rogue Squadron from Patty Jenkins. In May 2022, Kathleen Kennedy confirmed in an interview with Vanity Fair, that Rogue Squadron had been pushed off to the side by Lucasfilm. Although a Star Wars' film from Marvel CEO Kevin Feige was announced in October 2, 2019Brand New Alien From Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Meet Babu Frik Kennedy stated that there was no such project.\nJ.D. Dillard was reported to be working on a new Star Wars film in February 2020, but by November 8, 2022, he revealed that his Star Wars project was no longer in development. Additionally, the trilogy of Star Wars films from The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson has been prolonged, as Johnson continues to work on the multiple Knives Out films for Netflix. Kennedy noted that shes hesitant to use the word trilogies with Star Wars' presently as the franchise was more about persistent storytellers, and that now she had to recruit feature filmmakers who shared her visions.\nDuring Celebration Europe, on April 7, 2023, it was announced that three upcoming Star Wars films were in the works. One film will be directed by James Mangold, and will focus on the dawn of the Jedi, taking place before the events of The Phantom Menace. Another is directed by Dave Filoni, and will focus on the New Republic era, taking place between the events of Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, and will tie together the stories told in The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka. The final film announced will be directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, taking place after the events of The Rise of Skywalker, and will focus on Rey building a new Jedi Order.\n\n\u2022 Setting\n\nIV\nThe line \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.&hellip;,\" which appears at the beginning of every Star Wars film, and is the only way the Star Wars galaxy has been defined in relation to the real world. It is alluding to the classic fairy tale line \"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away&hellip;\" and variations thereof. It may reflect that the films are to be interpreted as the myths of the future, as opposed to literally meaning that the events take place in the past. Lucas himself intentionally left the details open to interpretation.\nThe saga shows an \"ancient\" galactic civilization thousands of years old. The setting is totally unrelated to Earth, the Milky Way Galaxy or reality, which gives it more liberty, in a sense. The Star Wars galaxy prominently features humans that look like those from Earth. Their civilization was able to develop space travel, terraform, build ecumenopoleis, and build space colonies 200,000 years \"ago,\" according to the Expanded Universe.\nThe titular Star Wars originally referred to the Galactic Civil War which takes place in the original trilogy. However, when considering the prequels (focusing on the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars), the sequels (depicting the First Order-Resistance War) and the Expanded Universe, these events are only a portion of the millennia-spanning war between the Sith and the Jedi/Galactic Republic.\nStar Wars also merges science with supernatural elements that strongly relate to epic stories and fairy tales (e.g., magic, knights, witches, princes, and \"whimsical\" alien races such as Ewoks, Wisties, etc.).\nWhile the scope of Star Wars history spans many thousands of years among all of the Star Wars history recorded and over 36,100 years in all the fiction produced to date (from Dawn of the Jedi to Star Wars: Legacy), the films span only two generations.\nLater novels from a series dubbed The New Jedi Order opened up the Star Wars setting with alien beings known as the Yuuzhan Vong that came from a different galaxy, much to the surprise of some fans. Nearly all species and events prior to this series considered only one single galaxy.\n\n\u2022 Franchise\n\n\u2022 Films\n\nGeorge Lucas\nThe original idea for Star Wars was conceived in the early 1970s and went through many revisions, providing plenty of material for the films. The original Star Wars movie (Episode IV) was first released in 1977, but the novelization was released six months earlier, in 1976. The sixth Star Wars film (Episode III) was released in 2005. There were originally to be nine films in three trilogies (some accounts claim twelve films in four trilogies); however, Lucas has stated that he does not intend to make any more Star Wars films after Episode III.\nOn October 30, 2012, The Walt Disney Company, along with the announcement of the acquisition of Lucasfilm, announced plans for the production of a new series of films, beginning with Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens in 2015, and plans for additional films. George Lucas announced he would not be directing the films but would serve as a creative consultant.\nAll of the original films were shot at, among other locations, Elstree Studios. Episode I was filmed at Leavesden Studios and the subsequent prequels were filmed in Sydney, Australia. Tunisia has served as the location for filming scenes set on the desert planet Tatooine.\nTogether, the first nine movies in the main saga have made a grand total of $8,789,255,249 worldwide at the box office. An eighth film has been released in 2017, titled Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, as well as a ninth, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.\nFilms by release order:\n\u2022 IV (May 25, 1977)\n\n\u2022 V (May 21, 1980)\n\n\u2022 VI (May 25, 1983)\n\n\u2022 I (May 19, 1999)\n\n\u2022 II (May 16, 2002)\n\n\u2022 III (May 19, 2005)\n\n\u2022 VII (December 18, 2015)\n\n\u2022 VIII (December 15, 2017)\n\n\u2022 IX (December 20, 2019)\n\n\u2022 Re-releases\n\nStar Wars home video releases\nGeorge Lucas has tinkered repeatedly with the original trilogy. For the Special Editions of Episodes IV through VI, the films were extensively cleaned up and restored, and Lucas took this opportunity to make a number of changes, adding previously cut scenes and new effects. The Special Editions were released in theaters in early 1997, and on VHS later that year. Further changes were made for the films' initial DVD release in September 2004. In 2006, Lucas finally released the original trilogy in unaltered form on DVD.\nAt a ShoWest convention in 2005, George Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he was planning to release all six films in a new 3D film format, beginning with A New Hope in 2007. This did not materialize, but on September 28, 2010, StarWars.com announced the 3D release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace coming to theaters in 2012.\nDespite the Disneys 2012 purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the release rights to all future Star Wars films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to A New Hope, which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchises five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through May 2020, at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Foxs perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films. On December 14, 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced that it is acquiring most of Foxs parent company, 21st Century Fox, including the film studio and all distribution rights to A New Hope.\n\n\u2022 Expanded Universe\n\nStar Wars Legends\nThe Expanded Universe (or EU) is the continuation of the movies. It plays a major role in the storyline. One can read books from the prequel era, between the movies, or post-Episode VI. There are also several books dealing with the lives of Han Solo and Lando Calrissian just before the movies. There are even books about the briefly shown Wedge Antilles. Some notable characters within the EU include the twins Jaina and Jacen Solo, former Emperors Hand Mara Jade, the pilot-turned-Jedi Corran Horn, and the tactical genius Grand Admiral Thrawn.\nThe books set during or after the Star Wars original trilogy follow Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and other minor characters, as well as the growth of the New Republic. The Truce at Bakura by Kathy Tyers is the first book chronologically set after Return of the Jedi, but the first Expanded Universe story written was Alan Dean Fosters Splinter of the Minds Eye.\nWriters in the Expanded Universe often gave context to details in the movies, for example explaining that the absence of non-humans shown in the Galactic Empire (compared to the numbers in the Rebellion) was because most Imperials were xenophobic.\n\n\u2022 Story\n\nThe earliest Expanded Universe stories chronologically are those in Dawn of the Jedi. Novels such as the Darth Bane Trilogy, The Old Republic: Revan, and Knight Errant feature both the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire.\nThousands of years later, series about the training of Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Naboo Crisis introduce the characters and situations that form the backbone of the story told in the films. The story then revolves around the Skywalker family and their friends and adversaries. The Skywalkers are involved in every important event from that point forward. They go through numerous wars, the last known being Cade Skywalker and the Second Imperial Civil War.\n\n\u2022 Radio adaptation\n\nStar Wars, the NPR radio adaptation (1981), was followed by adaptations of the next two films of the series. These adaptations were written by science-fiction author Brian Daley, who also wrote three novels detailing the adventures of Han Solo and Chewbacca prior to their appearance in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.\n\n\u2022 Related movies\n\nThere are six official feature-length works besides the primary films of the three trilogies:\n\u2022 The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978)\n\n\u2022 Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984)\n\n\u2022 Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\n\n\u2022 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\n\u2022 Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nThe first three of these are live-action, and were originally made for TV, though the 1984 Ewok film was shown in theaters in some locations outside the U.S. Star Wars: The Clone Wars is an animated theatrical feature kicking off the 2008 TV series. Rogue One and Solo are live-action standalone films.\nby the Tree of Life in The Star Wars Holiday Special.]]\nThe Star Wars Holiday Special became famous for featuring Boba Fetts first appearance. An originally minor detail, the Wookiee food wookiee-ookiees became a cult symbol in the Star Wars fan universe, spawning plays on its name such as wookiee-cookiees (a Star Wars'&ndash;themed dessert).\nThe term \"Wookiee hooky\" was used by media to reference high absenteeism to see a recently released Star Wars film.\nAdditionally, other filmmakers with no connection to Lucasfilm have made films that salute, document, parody, or unofficially extend Star Wars.\nMel Brooks Spaceballs (1987) parodies Star Wars' and some other science-fiction works.\nThe Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards is a Lucasfilm-sponsored contest of short films made by Star Wars fans about, referencing, and parodying the Star Wars phenomenon.\n\n\u2022 Animated TV shows\n\nAnimated Series by release order:\n\u2022 Star Wars: Droids (1985)\n\n\u2022 Ewoks (1985)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Rebels (2014)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Forces of Destiny (2017)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Resistance (2018)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Bad Batch (2021)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Visions (2021)\n\n\u2022 Tales (2022)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures (2023)\n\nAnimation formed another component Star Wars. The first two began in 1985, Clone Wars in 2003, The Clone Wars in 2008, Rebels in 2014, Forces of Destiny in 2017, Resistance in 2018, The Bad Batch in 2021 and Tales in 2022. Ewoks featured the adventures of the Ewoks prior to Return of the Jedi. Droids featured the adventures of C-3PO and R2-D2 between Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.\n\n\u2022 Live-action TV shows\n\nAnimated Series by release order:\n\u2022 The Mandalorian (2019)\n\n\u2022 The Book of Boba Fett (2021)\n\n\u2022 Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022)\n\n\u2022 Andor (2022)\n\n\u2022 Ahsoka (2023)\n\n\u2022 The Acolyte (2024)\n\n\u2022 Skeleton Crew (2024)\n\nIn 1984 and 1985, George Lucas executive produced two live-action television episodes of a short series called Ewok Adventures. These take place before the Battle of Endor and follow the brief adventures of the Towani family after they are marooned on Endor. The two episodes were named Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor, and Warwick Davis returned to once again play the plucky Ewok Wicket W. Warrick. One odd thing in this series was that Wicket was taught to speak English, an ability he did not reveal at all during Return of the Jedi.\nOn November 9, 2017, Disney chairman Bob Iger revealed that a new live-action Star Wars television series, The Mandalorian, was to be released on Disney, its new streaming service set to launch in 2019.\nAlongside The Mandalorian, there are also several other Star Wars television projects in development for Disney+, including the television series Obi-Wan Kenobi, Andor, and The Acolyte by Leslye Headland, the creator of Russian Doll.\n\n\u2022 Books\n\nList of books\nStar Wars&ndash;based fiction predates the release of the first movie, with the novelization of A New Hope (by Alan Dean Foster but credited to George Lucas) released some months before the film itself. Foster also wrote the first original Star Wars novel, Splinter of the Mind's Eye, the 1978 publication of which inaugurated a very successful literary spin-off franchise.\nThe six Star Wars movies have provided a basis for over a hundred novels. The novels have been authorized by Lucasfilm, and were previously published by Bantam Books (with a few early titles published by Ballantine), though Del Rey now holds the contract again. The stories told in these books reach back thousands of years before The Phantom Menace to several generations after Return of the Jedi. Books authorized by Lucas are written by fans of the films, and are part of a collection known as Expanded Universe. The first books considered to be part of the Expanded Universe began to appear in the late 1970s.\nMost of the novels that have been written take place after the events of the films, with a few that take place between the movies, and a growing number set before the films. For some fans, these can be more exciting stories, as they provide narratives for many characters who only have a minor roles, or are only briefly seen, in the movies. One of particular note is Steve Perrys Shadows of the Empire, which is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi'. In addition to focusing on relatively minor characters, it bridges some events between the two films.\nAlso, a few elements first introduced in the Expanded Universe were later included in the films. Such include Coruscant and Aayla Secura.\nAside from books providing narratives, there are also reference books which detail things about the Star Wars universe in a nonfiction style, revealing details that cannot fit into a story. Examples include The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide, Inside the Worlds of, and the Visual Dictionaries.\n\n\u2022 Comic books and strips\n\nStar Wars comic books\nto the Last Man cover]]\nMarvel Comics published adaptations of the original trilogy as well as a Star Wars comic book series which lasted from 1977 to 1986, a total of 107 issues and 3 annuals. A wide variety of creators worked on this series, including Archie Goodwin, Howard Chaykin, Al Williamson, Carmine Infantino, Walter Simonson, Michael Golden, Chris Claremont, Whilce Portacio, Mary Jo Duffy, and Ron Frenz. In the 1980s, as part of their Star Comics line oriented towards young children, Marvel also published the short-lived series Ewoks and Droids, based on the Saturday-morning cartoons.\nStar Wars was also a daily newspaper comic strip from 1979 to 1984, written for the bulk of its run by Archie Goodwin and drawn by Al Williamson.\nBeginning in the 1990s, Dark Horse Comics has published a large number of original adventures set in the Star Wars universe. As of 2006, these mainly include Star Wars: Republic, Star Wars: Empire, Star Wars Tales, Star Wars: Jedi, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Star Wars: Legacy. Dark Horse has also published collections of the Marvel series in seven volumes and the comic strip as Classic Star Wars.\n\n\u2022 Games\n\nSince 1983, over 120 video games have been published bearing the name of Star Wars, beginning with Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, published for the Atari 2600 by Parker Brothers.\nThe first games based on the franchise were released on the Atari 2600. In the first, The Empire Strikes Back (1982), the player drove a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth, destroying AT-AT walkers. While simplistic, the game captured the essence of the movie as well as technology allowed. Several other games appeared, like Return of the Jedi: Death Star Battle (1982), where the player controlled the Millennium Falcon in a mission to destroy the second Death Star, and Jedi Arena (1983), the first game to attempt to simulate a lightsaber battle (in this case, clearly inspired by the scene in A New Hope, where Luke Skywalker trains with a seeker). Also in 1983, Star Wars was released, based on A New Hope. In this game the player takes on the role of Luke Skywalker towards the end of the film in which Luke battles through many TIE fighters in an attempt to destroy the first Death Star.\nDue to the video-game crash of 1983, which killed the home-console market, no further games based on the franchise were released until 1991, when the platformer Star Wars was released for both the NES and Game Boy, and one year later, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back reused the engine with the plotline of the fifth episode of the saga. It would be still in 1992 that Super Star Wars was released for the SNES (the Super prefix was often used in remakes of 8-bit games), followed by the remaining games in the trilogy: Super Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back (1993) and Super Star Wars: Return of Jedi (1994).\nOther early titles include the game Star Wars for the Nintendo Entertainment System (published by JVC) and three other titles for the Atari 2600.\nVideo game pioneer Atari produced arcade games based on the original trilogy, beginning with Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, which were both flight-simulator-style games that utilized vector graphics. The third, Return of the Jedi, used more traditional raster graphics and a \"3/4\" perspective.\nStar Wars: X-Wing (1993) was the first PC game of the \"new generation\" of games released by LucasArts. It returns to the space-fighter combat gameplay not seen since the Atari arcade games. Players generally played as a pilot for the Rebel Alliance, completing a variety of goals, culminating in the destruction of the Death Star. This game had sequels, in the form of Star Wars: TIE Fighter and Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance.\nThe longest running series of computer games is the groundbreaking Dark Forces series. This first person shooter series began in 1995 with Star Wars: Dark Forces. The next in the series was Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, which allowed the player to play as a Jedi. The third game in the Dark Forces series, Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, focused more on a third-person Jedi adventure than the previous games. And the fourth and last release was Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, which originated as an expansion pack for Jedi Outcast, but evolved into a game of its own.\nAnother long-running video-game series began with Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for the Nintendo 64 and continued in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader and Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike for the Nintendo GameCube. The first title was also available for PCs, and all were developed by Factor 5 and published by LucasArts. Rogue Squadron III featured emulated versions of the original Atari Star Wars arcade games.\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, published in 2003, won \"Game of the Year\" recognition from several prominent gaming magazines, websites, etc. A sequel, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, was released for the Xbox in December of 2004 and the PC in February of 2005. Bioware released a MMORPG sequel to Knights of the Old Republic I and II called Star Wars: The Old Republic on December 20, 2011, set approximately 300 years after the events of Knights of the Old Republic II.\nStar Wars Galaxies, an MMORPG developed by Sony, was released on June 26, 2003 in the United States, November 7 in Europe, December 23, 2004 in Japan, and in 2006 in Australia. The game was set after the events of the Battle of Yavin, and allowed players to create characters of a variety of species and specializations (such as Bounty Hunter and Smuggler) and choose to ally themselves with the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire.\nStar Wars: Battlefront was released in 2004 and is a first-/third-person shooter game capable of online play where you can play in both trilogies, as all factions, in many different battlefields. Its sequels, Star Wars: Battlefront II, Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron and Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron, were released in 2005, 2007, and 2009 respectively.\nStar Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical shooter computer game featuring the elite commandos of Delta Squad and set during the Clone Wars. It was released on March 1, 2005.\nStar Wars: Empire at War, a real-time strategy game, was developed by Petroglyph Games and released on February 16, 2006, and an expansion pack, Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption, was released in 2007.\nLEGO Star Wars is a LEGO spinoff series in which the characters of Star Wars and most other vehicles and objects are made of LEGO bricks. The second game of the series is LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. The third game of this series, LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, combines the first two games. LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars is a LEGO version of the Clone Wars animated series, taking place during seasons 1 and 2.\nThree role-playing games set in the Star Wars universe have been published: a d6-based game from West End Games, a Wizards of the Coast game using the d20 system on which their popular Dungeons & Dragons is based, and a game from Fantasy Flight Games.\n\n\u2022 Cast and crew\n\nThe cast of the movies feature notable actors, such as Sofia Coppola and Keisha Castle-Hughes. Notable supporting roles played by acclaimed actors include Alec Guinness, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Oliver Ford Davies. In the prequel trilogy, professional models did the non-speaking minor-character roles.\n\n\u2022 Themes\n\nThe central theme of Star Wars is letting go. George Lucas believes that to be happy, one should accept all the happenings of reality and be compassionate by wholly letting go of their selfishness&mdash;including the fear of losing what one loves, which is an indicator of greed&mdash;to be more selfless.The Star Wars Archives: Episodes I\u2013III, 1999\u20132005\nStar Wars stresses the self-destructive nature of anger and hate, summed up in Yodas words (\"Fear is the path to the dark side: fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering\") as well as placing ones feelings for certain people aside. For example, Luke Skywalker is told to remain on Dagobah to complete his training rather than rescue his friends from Cloud City, because doing so will \"destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.\"\nLucas has identified the idea of a democracy becoming a dictatorship as the fundamental idea of the saga. He has stated that the saga raises such ideas as the people giving up their power in desperation, and betrayal by their leaders who may think they are doing the right thing while sacrificing freedom. In this way, Star Wars is a cautionary tale in which Lucas, by his own admission, warns people of the danger that is always present to democracy and freedom and has been demonstrated throughout history.\nThere appear to be anti-technological messages in the films: the primitive Ewoks defeating technological adversaries, and the general idea of technology opposed to humanity, fitting with Lucas vision. Lucas explicitly attributed the Ewoks defeat of the Galactic Empire to the exploits of the Vietnamese National Liberation Front (otherwise known as the Vietcong) that operated during the Vietnam War, and also implied in his 1973 draft that the Rebels were similar representations of said theme in the original film.The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film\nThe main story arc in the films traces the rise, fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker, mirrored by political events occurring on a galactic scale. As Anakin is seduced by the dark side, the Republic slides into despotism and war; when Anakin reclaims the Jedi values of peace and justice, the evil Empire that supplanted the Republic is overthrown by the Rebel Alliance.\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars\n\n\u2022 title/tt0076759\n\n\u2022",

Aside from Brianna, they all had identical appearances; Brianna had the same father as her half-sisters, but a different mother.

The only reason the Maw was visible was due to the ionizing gases being drawn into it.\n\nThe stability of the cluster itself was something of a mystery, with some believing that an [[Celestial/Legends|advanced civilization]] might have constructed it, rather than it merging together like a normal cluster would. In [[44 ABY]], the [[New Jedi Order]] learned from the [[Thuruht]] hive that the Maw was created by them and other [[Killik/Legends|Killik]] hives to serve as a prison for the dark side entity [[Abeloth]]. Under the direction of the [[Son/Legends|Son]] and [[Daughter/Legends|Daughter]] (who had joined the hivemind), the Killiks created [[Centerpoint Station]] and [[Sinkhole Station]]. Centerpoint was used by [[The Ones/Legends|The Ones]] to create the Maw itself, while Sinkhole Station was built to maintain the prison from within.\n\n==Description==\nThe Maw was a [[cluster]] of [[Black hole/Legends|black holes]]<ref name=\"TCSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|295|Maw Cluster}}</ref> located in the [[Kessel sector/Legends|Kessel sector]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]],<ref name=\"EAOC\" /> at the center of the [[Maw Nebulae]].<ref name=\"TEA\" /> The ionizing gases being drawn into it made the cluster visible and made it one of the [[Wonders of the Galaxy/Legends|Wonders of the Galaxy]].<ref name=\"TCSWE\" />\n\n[[File:KesselRun-rgb-lg.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Map of the Maw Cluster and its surrounding region.]]\n\nBecause of the intense gravity of the black holes, the entire [[Kessel system/Legends|Kessel system]] was slowly drawn into the Maw. The stability of the cluster itself was something of a mystery, with some believing that an advanced civilization might have constructed it, rather than it merging together like a normal cluster would.<ref name=\"TCSWE\" />\n\nMost of the area of the Maw was saturated in [[Radiation/Legends|radiation]], [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]], and strong [[Gravity/Legends|gravitational forces]]. Any ship's captains that neared the edge of the Maw would notice pieces of their ships being pulled apart, and some smugglers and criminals used it as a shortcut past the [[Kessel Run/Legends|Kessel Run]].\n\n==History==\nMillennia before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], [[The Ones/Legends|The Ones]] used [[Centerpoint Station]] to create the Maw [[Black hole/Legends|black hole]] cluster, while [[Sinkhole Station]] was built to maintain [[Abeloth]]'s [[Prison/Legends|prison]] from within.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Xim Wars]], a number of [[Warship/Legends|warships]] from [[Xim's empire]] were forced back to Kessel where several of them were lost in the Maw.<ref name=\"Xim Week\">{{SW|url=news/essential-atlas-extra-the-history-of-xim-and-the-tion-cluster|text=Essential Atlas Extra: The History of Xim and the Tion Cluster|int=Xim Week: The History of Xim and the Tion Cluster}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial Period===\nThe Maw was the site of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin's]] [[Maw Installation]], where the [[Death Star prototype]] and most of the first [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] was built, although it was completed at [[Despayre]]. Tarkin knew that the Maw's near-inaccessibility and remoteness made it easy for him to hide the project. The installation was actually located within a safe zone inside the cluster discovered just prior to the start of the project.\n[[File:Maw_Falcon_btm.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The ''Millennium Falcon'' departs Kessel and the Maw.]]\n\nA planetoid near the Maw was also the site of an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Maw Imperial Prison|detention base]] which was [[Battle near the Maw|attacked]] by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] [[Squadron/Legends|flight group]] [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]<ref name=\"RS II\" /> after the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]] in the year [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]].<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' places the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]].</ref> During the battle, numerous prisoners escaped and the prison was destroyed.<ref name=\"RS II\" />\n\nThe Maw was also the location of the creation and destruction of the [[Sun Crusher]]; it was constructed at the Maw Installation and destroyed when it was sent into one of the black holes within the Maw.<ref name=\"JAT\" /> Other [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapons]] designed and built there include the [[World Devastator]]s, the [[Tarkin (superweapon)|''Tarkin'']], the ''[[Ionic Ring Ship]]'', and the [[Galaxy Gun]].\n\n===Post-Galactic Civil War===\nDuring the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] sponsored the construction of a space station called [[Shelter]], which was built with the remains of Maw Installation as a refuge for fugitive [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]. Shelter was located at the very heart of the Maw and at one point housed the wartime generation of Jedi apprentices and surviving [[Jedi Praxeum]] students.<ref name=\"Edge II\" />\n\nIn [[43 ABY]], [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and his son [[Ben Skywalker|Ben]] visited the Maw during their journey to discover the reasons for [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo's]] fall to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side.]] Within The Maw, they discovered Sinkhole Station and the [[Mind Walkers]].<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nDuring the [[New Jedi Order]]'s conflict with the entity Abeloth, in [[44 ABY]], the Jedi Order learned from the [[Thuruht]] hive that the Maw was created by Thuruht and other [[Killik/Legends|Killik]] hives to serve as a prison for Abeloth.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Maw first appeared in the [[1994]] [[Star Wars: The Jedi Academy Trilogy|''The Jedi Academy Trilogy'']] book series.\n\nOn [[January 27]], [[2021]], the Maw was referenced in an astrophysics publication considering the potential formation of 'dark star clusters' containing up to thousands of black holes, most a few tens of times the mass of the sun. The authors commented that clusters like the Maw 'may be short-lived,' lending credence to the notion that the Maw would be physically unstable. This paper is one of the first publications in a leading astrophysics journal to cite a ''Star Wars'' novel.<ref name=\"ApJL\">{{WebCite|url=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210102217W/abstract|text=Black Hole Mergers from Star Clusters with Top-Heavy Initial Mass Functions|author=Weatherford, N.

    "plain_text": "Maw]]\n1\nKessel sector]]\nJedi Search\nThe Maw Cluster, or simply the Maw as it was sometimes called, was an unstable and mostly unnavigable cluster of black holes located near the planet Kessel. The only reason the Maw was visible was due to the ionizing gases being drawn into it.\nThe stability of the cluster itself was something of a mystery, with some believing that an advanced civilization might have constructed it, rather than it merging together like a normal cluster would. In 44 ABY, the New Jedi Order learned from the Thuruht hive that the Maw was created by them and other Killik hives to serve as a prison for the dark side entity Abeloth. Under the direction of the Son and Daughter (who had joined the hivemind), the Killiks created Centerpoint Station and Sinkhole Station. Centerpoint was used by The Ones to create the Maw itself, while Sinkhole Station was built to maintain the prison from within.\n\n\u2022 Description\n\nThe Maw was a cluster of black holes located in the Kessel sector of the Outer Rim Territories, at the center of the Maw Nebulae. The ionizing gases being drawn into it made the cluster visible and made it one of the Wonders of the Galaxy.\nBecause of the intense gravity of the black holes, the entire Kessel system was slowly drawn into the Maw. The stability of the cluster itself was something of a mystery, with some believing that an advanced civilization might have constructed it, rather than it merging together like a normal cluster would.\nMost of the area of the Maw was saturated in radiation, plasma, and strong gravitational forces. Any ship's captains that neared the edge of the Maw would notice pieces of their ships being pulled apart, and some smugglers and criminals used it as a shortcut past the Kessel Run.\n\n\u2022 History\n\nMillennia before the Battle of Yavin, The Ones used Centerpoint Station to create the Maw black hole cluster, while Sinkhole Station was built to maintain Abeloths prison from within.Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse'\nDuring the Xim Wars, a number of warships from Xim's empire were forced back to Kessel where several of them were lost in the Maw.\n\n\u2022 Imperial Period\n\nThe Maw was the site of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkins Maw Installation, where the Death Star prototype and most of the first Death Star was built, although it was completed at Despayre. Tarkin knew that the Maws near-inaccessibility and remoteness made it easy for him to hide the project. The installation was actually located within a safe zone inside the cluster discovered just prior to the start of the project.\nA planetoid near the Maw was also the site of an Imperial detention base which was attacked by the Rebel Alliance flight group Rogue Squadron after the Battle of Hoth in the year 3 ABY.The New Essential Chronology places the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. During the battle, numerous prisoners escaped and the prison was destroyed.\nThe Maw was also the location of the creation and destruction of the Sun Crusher; it was constructed at the Maw Installation and destroyed when it was sent into one of the black holes within the Maw. Other superweapons designed and built there include the World Devastators, the Tarkin, the Ionic Ring Ship, and the Galaxy Gun.\n\n\u2022 Post-Galactic Civil War\n\nDuring the Yuuzhan Vong War, Lando Calrissian sponsored the construction of a space station called Shelter, which was built with the remains of Maw Installation as a refuge for fugitive Jedi Knights. Shelter was located at the very heart of the Maw and at one point housed the wartime generation of Jedi apprentices and surviving Jedi Praxeum students.\nIn 43 ABY, Luke Skywalker and his son Ben visited the Maw during their journey to discover the reasons for Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side. Within The Maw, they discovered Sinkhole Station and the Mind Walkers.\nDuring the New Jedi Order's conflict with the entity Abeloth, in 44 ABY, the Jedi Order learned from the Thuruht hive that the Maw was created by Thuruht and other Killik hives to serve as a prison for Abeloth.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe Maw first appeared in the 1994 The Jedi Academy Trilogy book series.\nOn January 27, 2021, the Maw was referenced in an astrophysics publication considering the potential formation of dark star clusters containing up to thousands of black holes, most a few tens of times the mass of the sun. The authors commented that clusters like the Maw may be short-lived, lending credence to the notion that the Maw would be physically unstable. This paper is one of the first publications in a leading astrophysics journal to cite a Star Wars novel.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 A Death Star Is Born\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook]]\n\u2022 Fly Casual\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",

Such was his command of the Force that he needed no [[Navigation computer/Legends|navigation computer]] to calculate his hyperspatial course. These skills earned for him the deep respect of the [[Sons and Daughters of Freedom]], a vigilante militant crew that often aided the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].\n\nIn atmospheric flight, ''Sharp Spiral'' was one of the fastest starfighters in the Jedi fleet. Its aerodynamic design made it supreme in the atmospheres of most planets.\n\nTiin perfected his piloting skills in the ''Sharp Spiral'' on his home [[List of planets/Legends|planet]] of [[Iktotch/Legends|Iktotch]]. The constant gale-force winds would pose a challenge to any pilot&mdash;even a Jedi. After training in this manner for several years, Tiin was ready to face any aerial threat unfortunate enough to get in his way.\n\n[[File:Spiraldraw3.jpg|thumb|left|180px]]\n\nThe ''Sharp Spiral'' had its finest hour when Tiin found himself facing down three large [[Warship/Legends|warships]] piloted by disenchanted members of the Freedom's Sons. Tiin utilized dizzying flight patterns to disable all the key components on the enemy craft.

Tiin modified his fighter heavily, adding a handmade hyperdrive unit, as well as adding laser cannons taken from a Hutt and a concealed proton torpedo launcher.\nTiin used his connection to the Force to increase the speed of his hyperdrive and guide him through hyperspace as he flew dangerously close to mass shadows. Such was his command of the Force that he needed no navigation computer to calculate his hyperspatial course. These skills earned for him the deep respect of the Sons and Daughters of Freedom, a vigilante militant crew that often aided the Jedi.\nIn atmospheric flight, Sharp Spiral was one of the fastest starfighters in the Jedi fleet. Its aerodynamic design made it supreme in the atmospheres of most planets.\nTiin perfected his piloting skills in the Sharp Spiral on his home planet of Iktotch. The constant gale-force winds would pose a challenge to any pilot&mdash;even a Jedi. After training in this manner for several years, Tiin was ready to face any aerial threat unfortunate enough to get in his way.\nThe Sharp Spiral had its finest hour when Tiin found himself facing down three large warships piloted by disenchanted members of the Freedom's Sons. Tiin utilized dizzying flight patterns to disable all the key components on the enemy craft. The helpless craft had been so damaged by this lone starfighter that they were left to float in empty space until they were arrested by Republic authorities.\nIn 19 BBY,The New Essential Chronology places the execution of Order 66 in 19 BBY Tinn had parked the Sharp Spiral in a spaceport on Coruscant on the night prior to his death and the beginning of the Great Jedi Purge.

After the Republic revealed its [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|clone army]] on Geonosis, the Separatists were forced to retreat, beginning a great war that would last for three years and tear [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] apart.\n\nThe CIS put fear in the hearts of countless citizens of the Republic, largely due to [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]], [[Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies/Legends|Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies]]. The Confederacy won many battles in the ensuing war but was dissolved when they were betrayed by Sidious, who had the [[Separatist Council/Legends|Separatist Council]] leaders [[Mission to Mustafar/Legends|massacred]] by his apprentice [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] on [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]], allowing Sidious to reform the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\n==History==\n===The rise of the Separatist movement===\n{{Quote|As I explained to you earlier, I am quite convinced that ten thousand more systems will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen.|Count Dooku, to the Separatist Council|<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\">{{Film|II}}</ref>|audio=Dooku-Rally-AOTC.ogg}}\n[[File:Inhischambers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The increased corruption within both the Republic and the Jedi Order began spreading secessionist ideals across the known galaxy, especially under Chancellor Valorum's controversial leadership.]]\nIn the decades prior to the Clone Wars, the Republic was seen by many as a failing government, plagued by corruption and mindless bureaucracy that stifled the voices of many constituents represented in the Galactic Senate. Secession grew during the period following the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], and the commerce guilds and trading corporations became disillusioned with the Republic after the law was passed to place taxation on all trade routes to outlying [[Star system/Legends|star systems]].\n\nInto this critical situation stepped [[Count of Serenno/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], a former [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] who had become disillusioned with the Republic and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] that served it. This charismatic figure stirred up anti-Republic sentiments on many worlds, paving the way for a rebellion against the government. A loose affiliation of separatists was formed, with Dooku at their [[Head of State/Legends|head]], pushing for a new government to take the place of the stagnant Republic. Eventually, this Separatist movement established itself as the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a body formally opposed to the Galactic Republic. The members of the CIS included the [[Corporate Alliance/Legends|Corporate Alliance]], [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]], [[Commerce Guild/Legends|Commerce Guild]], [[InterGalactic Banking Clan/Legends|InterGalactic Banking Clan]] and the [[Techno Union/Legends|Techno Union]].

The [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]], commanded by the Republic to downsize its [[Trade Federation Droid Army/Legends|Droid Army]] after the [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] incident, instead expanded its forces in secret, adding its [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] to the [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|Separatist arsenal]] steadily growing with input from other factions, such as the [[Techno Union/Legends|Techno Union]]. Foundries on [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]], [[Hypori/Legends|Hypori]], and elsewhere created countless billions of battle droids ready to fight for the Separatist cause, all while Dooku continued to recruit more star systems to his cause.\n\nHowever, the CIS would soon lose the advantage of surprise when [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], having tracked the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]] from [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]] to Geonosis, managed to send a message to [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]], betraying the Confederate presence on Geonosis. In the middle of sending the message, he was attacked by a [[Droideka/Legends|droideka]], prompting Anakin and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9]] to go and rescue him and upon arriving on Geonosis, both were captured in one of the massive [[Geonosis droid factories/Legends|Geonosis droid foundries]], and were sentenced to death in a combat arena alongside Obi-Wan.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\n[[File:Battle_of_Geonosis.png|thumb|right|250px|The First Battle of Geonosis would trigger the official war between the CIS and Galactic Republic.]]\nHowever, as the execution was being carried out, [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] and a vast number of Jedi arrived to rescue them from the Separatist's and after a skirmish with droids in the combat arena the sheer numbers of Separatist forces proved overwhelming, killing large numbers of Jedi and before long only a dozen or so remained.\n\nFortunately for the remaining Jedi, Master [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] soon arrived with a large military force of [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry/Legends|LAAT/i]] [[Gunship/Legends|gunships]], rescuing the Jedi and engaged in what was to be known as the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|The First Battle of Geonosis]] against [[Geonosian/Legends|the Geonosian natives]] and their battle droid forces.

However, the tables turned and it began to suffer a series of defeats, which led to the [[Outer Rim Sieges/Legends|Outer Rim Sieges]]. The Confederacy was responsible for some atrocities during the war, particularly by General Grievous. Throughout the war, the Confederacy attempted to gain the advantage using [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapons]], such as the [[Dark Reaper]] and the [[Malevolence/Legends|''Malevolence'']] [[Ion pulse cannon/Legends|ion pulse cannons]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (video game)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' video game]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Tann_Kaer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sev'rance Tann, one of Dooku's Dark Acolytes, would lead CIS forces to many victories in the early stages of the Clone Wars.]]\nDuring the war, there were many heroes on the side of the Confederacy, including [[Sev'rance Tann/Legends|Sev'rance Tann]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns]]''</ref> [[Durge/Legends|Durge]], and [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\">''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''</ref> and General [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]], many of whom were driven by hatred of the Republic or the Jedi. At around the midpoint of the war, Grievous initiated [[Operation Durge's Lance]], a campaign which spearhead into the [[Inner Rim/Legends|Inner Rim]], leading to a string of Confederate victories, including the [[Battle of Duro (Clone Wars)|conquest]] of [[Duro/Legends|Duro]].<ref name=\"CIS Shadowfeed (Insider)\">[[CIS Shadowfeed (Insider)|''CIS Shadowfeed'']]</ref> At this point, many were certain that CIS victory was inevitable.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\" />\n[[File:Seps.jpg|thumb|left|170px|General Grievous would duel Asajj Ventress and Durge, defeating them both and becoming the Supreme Commander of the CIS Droid Army.]]\nHowever, soon the Republic began going on the offensive, winning battles at [[Bomis Koori IV]], [[Boz Pity/Legends|Boz Pity]], and others. With the death and loss of Confederate heroes Durge and Asajj Ventress, the Confederacy began to lose the advantage. The Republic began laying siege to what Palpatine called a [[Triad of Evil/Legends|Triad of Evil]]: [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]], [[Mygeeto/Legends|Mygeeto]], and [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]], and the Separatist council was forced to keep on the move.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\" /> However, the Confederacy still had plenty of fight left, as it began launching assaults on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] and other worlds.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" /> This culminated when Grievous led a [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|massive assault]] on Coruscant to \"capture\" the Supreme Chancellor. However, Palpatine was rescued and despite many losses, the Republic did inflict more damage on the Separatists, and even killing Count Dooku in the process. Unbeknownst to the Separatists, Palpatine's capture and Dooku's death were both orchestrated by Sidious.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" />\n\n===The Fall of the Confederacy===\n[[File:SepCouncilUtapau-ROTS.png|thumb|right|250px|The Separatist Council on Utapau in 19 BBY, after Dooku's death.]]\nThe Confederacy of Independent Systems was eventually defeated, though this was not its own fault. Suffering losses&mdash;and victories, for that matter&mdash;right from the beginning of the war, and despite the might of General Grievous and its vastly superior numbers, the droid forces were often defeated by the Republic. However, as Darth Sidious manipulated the war, deceived both sides, influenced some of the defeats of the CIS as well as some of its victories, the Separatists had lost before they had even started fighting&mdash;Sidious wanted the Republic to win.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: Republic\">''[[Star Wars: Republic]]''</ref> At the end of the war, Count Dooku was betrayed by Sidious, who as Palpatine, had him struck down by Anakin Skywalker on board the [[Invisible Hand/Legends|''Invisible Hand'']], General Grievous was killed on [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]] by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Sidious betrayed the CIS leadership by having them murdered on Mustafar by his new apprentice Darth Vader, and the commerce guilds faded quietly into oblivion.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\">{{Film|III}}</ref>\n\nThe Confederacy's legacy lived on in the form of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] project, which became the Empire's feared superweapon, as well as the [[Battle droid/Legends#Galactic Empire/Imperial Remnant|Imperial battle droids]].\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:FirstBattleOfKashyyyk-EGTW.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Any Separatist holdouts that persisted after the Clone Wars were mercilessly hunted down and destroyed by the new Galactic Empire, led by ruthless enforcers such as Darth Vader.]]\nThe corporations that made up the Confederacy were [[Imperialization/Legends|Imperialized]] and assimilated into the Imperial war machine, and most of the Separatist worlds were absorbed into the Empire, with many prominent races of the Confederacy enslaved, while others, such as the Trandoshans, allied themselves with the Empire. The majority of the droid armies were shut down, providing no opposition to the Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. The Death Star project, originally the CIS's, was absorbed by the Galactic Empire.\n\nHowever, reminders and relics of the Confederacy continued to survive the ages. On [[Jaguada's moon]], a small army of droids was accidentally reactivated by some fugitive Jedi. Old droid parts were used by [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] forces during a [[Battle of Kashyyyk (19 BBY)|battle against Imperial forces]].

He reactivated a droid factory on Mustafar and built a small army. He was preparing to start another war, in an effort to take advantage of the reorganization of the newly christened Galactic Empire.\n\nHe started by activating a droid fleet around Mustafar's orbit to defend his factory. He drew up prototype plans for a [[Confederate infantry prototype]], similar to the [[B2-series super battle droid/Legends|B2 super battle droid]], that had layers of armor.\n\n[[File:Gizor_Dellso_and_bodyguards.jpg|thumb|right||200px|Gizor Dellso with his Geonosian guards before the collapse of his holdout.]]\nAs his soldiers were guarding the factory, an Imperial fleet bearing the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] arrived at Mustafar. A [[HMP droid gunship/Legends|Heavy Missile Platform]] landed in the hangar of the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]], and several battle droids emerged and attacked the stormtroopers inside. However, with the use of [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonators]], rocket launchers, and time bombs, the troops destroyed the droid gunship. The Empire then engaged and destroyed the still weak Separatist fleet and proceeded to the planet's surface. The [[Battle of Mustafar (Imperial Period)|Battle of Mustafar]] erupted, but due to the insufficient time for Gizor Dellso to unleash his new droid army, his obsolete droids fought a losing battle. Dellso and his Geonosian retinue died along with their hopes for a new war. The factory was subsequently destroyed by heavy [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]] and the [[Separatist holdouts/Legends|Separatist holdouts]] began to decline rapidly.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Battlefront II\">''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]''</ref>\n\nBy [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], the remaining holdouts joined the Rebel Alliance and supplied the [[Alliance Fleet/Legends|Alliance Fleet]] with many remaining separatist vessels including a [[Providence-class carrier/destroyer/Legends|Providence-class carrier/destroyer]] called ''[[Rebel One]]''.<ref name=\"SWR:MBME\">[[Rebellion 5|''Rebellion'' 5]]</ref> The Rebel Alliance in general was seen by some observers as a spiritual successor to the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\n==Government and Politics==\n{{Quote|I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count.

These individuals were not warriors or generals, but merchants, more interested in commerce than battle, and thus were ill-equipped to lead troops into battle. Of the entire political leadership, only Count Dooku, [[Poggle the Lesser/Legends|Poggle the Lesser]], and Nute Gunray had any experience in warfare,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" /> although some of the Council members had skills with leading, like Wat Tambor, who was renowned as a superior strategist by many.<ref name=\"bf5\">''[[Boba Fett: A New Threat]]''</ref> Other military officials included [[General/Legends|General]] [[Whorm Loathsom/Legends|Whorm Loathsom]], General [[Oro Dassyne/Legends|Oro Dassyne]], General [[Lok Durd/Legends|Lok Durd]] and [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Merai]]. [[Sentepeth Findos]], later the Acting Viceroy of the [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] was a lieutenant.\n\nThe CIS military was primarily composed of battle droids, weapons and ships that were once used by the leadership's corporations as private security. Pooling their droid forces together, the CIS had managed to create can army so massive that it could potentially overthrow the Republic and was generally referred as the droid army. While mostly formed of droids, various organic forces also fought for the CIS forces during the war including bounty hunters, smugglers, and even Dark Jedi with many of them serving as high ranking officers. Various worlds that joined the CIS also had their militaries assimilated into the CIS.\n\nThe CIS leaders believed their superior numbers and advanced droid designs would win the Clone Wars and in some ways they were right, with Droidekas being able to use weaponry and shields capable of killing Jedi, and Battle Droids and Super Battle Droids capable of overwhelming forces with sheer numbers that the clones couldn't contend with. However, the incompetence of some [[Droid/Legends|droids]], like the B1 battle droids, lost the CIS many skirmishes.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" />\n\nOne of the largest contributions was by the Techno Union, which donated not only its new B2 super battle droids, but numerous foundries capable of producing thousands more droids for the Confederacy. Other companies that supported the Separatist's included [[Colla Designs/Legends|Colla Designs]], [[Phlac-Arphocc Automata Industries/Legends|Phlac-Arphocc Automata Industries]], [[Baktoid Armor Workshop/Legends|Baktoid Industries]], [[Haor Chall Engineering/Legends|Haor Chall Engineering]], [[Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps/Legends|Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps]], [[Republic Sienar Systems/Legends|Republic Sienar Systems]], [[Retail Caucus/Legends|Retail Clan]], and [[Feethan Ottraw Scalable Assemblies/Legends|Feethan Ottraw Scalable Assemblies]].\n\n[[File:Homing_Spider_Droid.png|thumb|250px|The [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|Separatist Droid Army]] at the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|First Battle of Geonosis]].]]\nOther allies were quick to offer help. The Confederacy controlled countless worlds across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], and was able to recruit many of their local forces to the cause. The [[Jabiimi]] [[Jabiimi Nationalists|Separatist]] leader [[Alto Stratus]]'s [[Nimbus commando]]s, the [[Quarren Isolation League/Legends|Quarren Isolation League]], the [[Mandalorian Protectors/Legends|Mandalorian Protectors]], and many more aided the CIS in fighting the Galactic Republic. The Separatist Army also used a number of organic forces, from [[Gossam Commandos/Legends|Gossam Commandos]] to [[Koorivar Fusiliers/Legends|Koorivar Fusiliers]], they brought new tactics onto the field and were capable of independent thought and the use of real time military strategy that could give them an advantage over the AI of droids and many could rival even the Republic's [[Clone trooper/Legends|Clone Troopers]] capabilities.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Republic\" />\n\nAs the leader of the CIS, Dooku also served as the supreme leader of it's military forces and lead various high priority operations with the intent of quickly ending the war. Knowing that the battle droids used textbook tactics during battle, Dooku would often hire various mercenaries, bounty hunters, and smugglers to both take command of the droid forces to help give them an advantage. Given his vast wealth, Dooku would some of the galaxy's most notorious contractors including [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]], [[Durge/Legends]], [[Cydon Prax]], [[Cad Bane/Legends|Cad Bane]], and several others who often accepted these jobs due to the large pay. Aside from hiring mercenaries to fight for the CIS, Dooku also recruited various [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] to either train as his own apprentices or simply help combat the [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi Generals]]. Among these [[Dark Acolyte/Legends|Dark Acolytes]] were [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]], [[Savage Opress/Legends|Savage Opress]], and [[Sora Bulq/Legends|Sora Bulq.]]\n\nBridging the gap between organic and automation was: General Grievous, [[Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies/Legends|Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies]]. A cyborg with a brilliant tactical mind and a powerful armored body, Grievous turned the war in favor of the Confederacy. He led his troops to a number of victories across the galaxy including the conquest of Duro and the destruction of [[Humbarine/Legends|Humbarine]], the attacks of strategic [[Loyalist/Legends|Loyalist]] worlds, and spearheaded an assault towards Coruscant itself capturing the leader of the Republic [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] in the process. He also targeted the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] &mdash; particularly problematic to the droid army &mdash; and killed many in one on one combat. He had ultimate power over his troops, able to command them with but a gesture. One thing that made him a force to be reckoned with was his use of four lightsabers, from a personal collection of his taken from fallen Jedi Generals he had bested in combat. With the use of weapons to such a proficiency he was able to crush all in his path, leading to countless victories for the CIS. Asajj Ventress and the bounty hunter Durge were also effective commanders on the battlefield.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" />\n\nThe Separatist Army was not merely composed of ground troops. It also deployed much larger weapons of war during the Clone Wars. Commerce Guild [[OG-9 homing spider droid/Legends|OG-9 homing spider droids]] were a common sight on Confederate frontlines, and [[NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer/Legends|NR-N99 Persuader Tank Droids]], [[Manta droid subfighter|Manta Droid Subfighters]], and [[Armored Assault Tank/Legends|Federation AATs]] provided heavy firepower in countless conflicts. Added to this the use of super weaponry such as the powerful [[Protodeka]], the massive [[Seismic tank/Legends|Seismic tank]], and the terrible [[Dark Reaper]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" /> However, weaknesses found in these machines were often exploited by the Republic.\n\n==Astrography==\nThe territory of the Confederacy of Independent Systems varied in size a great deal during the course of its short history. As of [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], the Confederacy of Independent Systems numbered at several thousand star systems, as well as the various commercial factions with the planets they controlled, allied under its banner.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\n{{ScrollBox|\n[[File:Clone_wars_factions.jpg|right|thumb|A galactic map, showing the greatest extent of Confederacy of

Formed by various planetary and sectorial governments, as well as some mega-corporations, that declared intentions to leave the Galactic Republic, refusing to comply with its excessive taxation and corruption in the Senate during the Separatist Crisis.\nEventually, tensions between it and the Republic developed into war after Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala were sentenced to execution on Geonosis and a group of Jedi led by Mace Windu attempted to rescue them. After the Republic revealed its clone army on Geonosis, the Separatists were forced to retreat, beginning a great war that would last for three years and tear the galaxy apart.\nThe CIS put fear in the hearts of countless citizens of the Republic, largely due to General Grievous, Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. The Confederacy won many battles in the ensuing war but was dissolved when they were betrayed by Sidious, who had the Separatist Council leaders massacred by his apprentice Darth Vader on Mustafar, allowing Sidious to reform the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 The rise of the Separatist movement\n\nII\nIn the decades prior to the Clone Wars, the Republic was seen by many as a failing government, plagued by corruption and mindless bureaucracy that stifled the voices of many constituents represented in the Galactic Senate. Secession grew during the period following the Invasion of Naboo, and the commerce guilds and trading corporations became disillusioned with the Republic after the law was passed to place taxation on all trade routes to outlying star systems.\nInto this critical situation stepped Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master who had become disillusioned with the Republic and the Jedi Order that served it. This charismatic figure stirred up anti-Republic sentiments on many worlds, paving the way for a rebellion against the government. A loose affiliation of separatists was formed, with Dooku at their head, pushing for a new government to take the place of the stagnant Republic. Eventually, this Separatist movement established itself as the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a body formally opposed to the Galactic Republic. The members of the CIS included the Corporate Alliance, Trade Federation, Commerce Guild, InterGalactic Banking Clan and the Techno Union. Although the Republic recognized that many of its member worlds were in rebellion, it refused to formally acknowledge the existence of the CIS as their common government, deeming that doing so would legitimize it.Labyrinth of Evil\nUnknown to the Republic, Dooku was also Darth Tyranus, Sith apprentice to Darth Sidious, who had previous ties with the Trade Federation ordered the Invasion of Naboo. Under the guise of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Republic, Sidious had used Tyranus as the public leader for the CIS in the Sith's plot to destroy the Jedi Order and transform the galaxy.\n\n\u2022 Clone Wars\n\nCount Dooku\nThe Confederacy marshaled armed forces to its cause, to be eventually used to topple the Republic and take the capital planet of Coruscant. The Trade Federation, commanded by the Republic to downsize its Droid Army after the Naboo incident, instead expanded its forces in secret, adding its battle droids to the Separatist arsenal steadily growing with input from other factions, such as the Techno Union. Foundries on Geonosis, Hypori, and elsewhere created countless billions of battle droids ready to fight for the Separatist cause, all while Dooku continued to recruit more star systems to his cause.\nHowever, the CIS would soon lose the advantage of surprise when Obi-Wan Kenobi, having tracked the bounty hunter Jango Fett from Kamino to Geonosis, managed to send a message to Anakin Skywalker and the Jedi Council, betraying the Confederate presence on Geonosis. In the middle of sending the message, he was attacked by a droideka, prompting Anakin and Padm\u00e9 to go and rescue him and upon arriving on Geonosis, both were captured in one of the massive Geonosis droid foundries, and were sentenced to death in a combat arena alongside Obi-Wan.\nHowever, as the execution was being carried out, Mace Windu and a vast number of Jedi arrived to rescue them from the Separatist's and after a skirmish with droids in the combat arena the sheer numbers of Separatist forces proved overwhelming, killing large numbers of Jedi and before long only a dozen or so remained.\nFortunately for the remaining Jedi, Master Yoda soon arrived with a large military force of LAAT/i gunships, rescuing the Jedi and engaged in what was to be known as the The First Battle of Geonosis against the Geonosian natives and their battle droid forces. Republic forces struck all over Geonosis, and the Clone Wars officially began. The CIS was defeated at Geonosis, but it was ultimately inconsequential.\nFor the next three years, the Republic and CIS would be engaged in a brutal war, with many dying on both sides. Unbeknownst to all, the war was merely all part of a plan by Darth Sidious to bring about his ultimate goal: domination of the galaxy by the Sith.Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith novelization\nFor the first half of the war, the Confederacy was doing well, capturing many planets, despite losses on Muunilinst and Dac. However, the tables turned and it began to suffer a series of defeats, which led to the Outer Rim Sieges. The Confederacy was responsible for some atrocities during the war, particularly by General Grievous. Throughout the war, the Confederacy attempted to gain the advantage using superweapons, such as the Dark Reaper and the Malevolence ion pulse cannons.Star Wars: The Clone Wars video game\nDuring the war, there were many heroes on the side of the Confederacy, including Sevrance Tann,Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns Durge, and Asajj Ventress,Star Wars: Clone Wars and General Grievous, many of whom were driven by hatred of the Republic or the Jedi. At around the midpoint of the war, Grievous initiated Operation Durges Lance, a campaign which spearhead into the Inner Rim, leading to a string of Confederate victories, including the conquest of Duro.CIS Shadowfeed' At this point, many were certain that CIS victory was inevitable.\nHowever, soon the Republic began going on the offensive, winning battles at Bomis Koori IV, Boz Pity, and others. With the death and loss of Confederate heroes Durge and Asajj Ventress, the Confederacy began to lose the advantage. The Republic began laying siege to what Palpatine called a Triad of Evil: Felucia, Mygeeto, and Saleucami, and the Separatist council was forced to keep on the move. However, the Confederacy still had plenty of fight left, as it began launching assaults on Kashyyyk and other worlds. This culminated when Grievous led a massive assault on Coruscant to \"capture\" the Supreme Chancellor. However, Palpatine was rescued and despite many losses, the Republic did inflict more damage on the Separatists, and even killing Count Dooku in the process. Unbeknownst to the Separatists, Palpatines capture and Dookus death were both orchestrated by Sidious.\n\n\u2022 The Fall of the Confederacy\n\nThe Confederacy of Independent Systems was eventually defeated, though this was not its own fault. Suffering losses&mdash;and victories, for that matter&mdash;right from the beginning of the war, and despite the might of General Grievous and its vastly superior numbers, the droid forces were often defeated by the Republic. However, as Darth Sidious manipulated the war, deceived both sides, influenced some of the defeats of the CIS as well as some of its victories, the Separatists had lost before they had even started fighting&mdash;Sidious wanted the Republic to win.Star Wars: Republic At the end of the war, Count Dooku was betrayed by Sidious, who as Palpatine, had him struck down by Anakin Skywalker on board the Invisible Hand, General Grievous was killed on Utapau by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Sidious betrayed the CIS leadership by having them murdered on Mustafar by his new apprentice Darth Vader, and the commerce guilds faded quietly into oblivion.III\nThe Confederacys legacy lived on in the form of the Death Star project, which became the Empires feared superweapon, as well as the Imperial battle droids.\n\n\u2022 Aftermath\n\nThe corporations that made up the Confederacy were Imperialized and assimilated into the Imperial war machine, and most of the Separatist worlds were absorbed into the Empire, with many prominent races of the Confederacy enslaved, while others, such as the Trandoshans, allied themselves with the Empire. The majority of the droid armies were shut down, providing no opposition to the Imperial stormtroopers. The Death Star project, originally the CIS's, was absorbed by the Galactic Empire.\nHowever, reminders and relics of the Confederacy continued to survive the ages. On Jaguadas moon, a small army of droids was accidentally reactivated by some fugitive Jedi. Old droid parts were used by Wookiee forces during a battle against Imperial forces. In that same battle, an old CIS warship was used to the advantage of escaping Jedi.Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader A contingent of B1 battle droids continued to function on Geonosis, although they were defeated by a squad of stormtroopers that crashed on the planet, as well as Wedge Antilles.Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike The Zann Consortium used an old droid factory on Hypori to build droideka Mark IIs for its forces.Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption Even after the decline of the Empire, regular droidekas were used by some smugglers, as well as races like the Vagaari.Survivor's Quest\n\n\u2022 Separatist holdouts\n\nSeparatist holdouts/Legends\nAfter the deaths of the members of the Separatist Council, some Separatist-loyal worlds still refused to be absorbed into the new Galactic Empire. These remnants, some organized and unorganized, would continue to fight throughout the Imperial era. The Empire would use these holdouts as justification for expansion of the Imperial Navy. Many of them ended up joining the Rebel Alliance at its formation.Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections\n\n\u2022 Gizor Dellso's rebellion\n\nAt some point after the war, Gizor Dellso, a Geonosian droid manufacturer who managed to survive the demise of the Confederacy leaders at the end of the Clone Wars, initiated a plan to revive the Confederacy. He reactivated a droid factory on Mustafar and built a small army. He was preparing to start another war, in an effort to take advantage of the reorganization of the newly christened Galactic Empire.\nHe started by activating a droid fleet around Mustafar's orbit to defend his factory. He drew up prototype plans for a Confederate infantry prototype, similar to the B2 super battle droid, that had layers of armor.\nAs his soldiers were guarding the factory, an Imperial fleet bearing the 501st Legion arrived at Mustafar. A Heavy Missile Platform landed in the hangar of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, and several battle droids emerged and attacked the stormtroopers inside. However, with the use of thermal detonators, rocket launchers, and time bombs, the troops destroyed the droid gunship. The Empire then engaged and destroyed the still weak Separatist fleet and proceeded to the planets surface. The Battle of Mustafar erupted, but due to the insufficient time for Gizor Dellso to unleash his new droid army, his obsolete droids fought a losing battle. Dellso and his Geonosian retinue died along with their hopes for a new war. The factory was subsequently destroyed by heavy orbital bombardment and the Separatist holdouts began to decline rapidly.Star Wars: Battlefront II'\nBy 2 BBY, the remaining holdouts joined the Rebel Alliance and supplied the Alliance Fleet with many remaining separatist vessels including a Providence-class carrier/destroyer called Rebel One.Rebellion 5 The Rebel Alliance in general was seen by some observers as a spiritual successor to the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\n\u2022 Government and Politics\n\nPadm\u00e9 Amidala, to Dooku\nDooku and Asajj Ventress]]\nThe Confederacy had a single Head of State, and beneath him was the Separatist Council. The official leader of the Confederacy was a former Jedi Master named Count Dooku, also known as Darth Tyranus, Darth Sidious's second known apprentice. Operating between the Head of State and the Separatist Council was the Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies, General Grievous, who had no ordinary power in the civil government but was first in line to lead the Confederacy should the Head of State be incapacitated. If both Dooku and Grievous were to be incapacitated then Nute Gunray, as the member of the Separatist Council who had made the largest financial contribution to the war effort, would take over as Head of State. Operating alongside the council was the Separatist Parliament who dealt with diplomatic and civilian issues. However, the real power behind the Confederacy was the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, though this fact was known to very few people.\nThe Separatist Council consisted of ten leaders. Each leader had his or her own assistants, advisors and delegates. The Separatist Council consisted of:\n\u2022 Nute Gunray&mdash;Viceroy of the Trade Federation &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Rune Haako&mdash;Settlement Officer of the Trade Federation &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Rute Gunnay&mdash;Aide to Nute Gunray &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Poggle the Lesser&mdash;Archduke of Geonosis &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Sun Fac&mdash;Chief Lieutenant to Poggle the Lesser &dagger;\n\n, Skakoan Foreman of the Techno Union]]\n\u2022 Wat Tambor&mdash;Foreman of the Techno Union, Executive of Baktoid Armor Workshop and Senator of Skako\n\n\u2022 Skakoan legal deputies&mdash;Aides and Staff of Tambor &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Techno Union scientist &dagger;\n\n\u2022 San Hill&mdash;Chairman of the InterGalactic Banking Clan &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Banking Clan Representative\n\n\u2022 Lo Vapeet&mdash;Vice-Chair of Communications of the InterGalactic Banking Clan\n\n\u2022 Shu Mai&mdash;Presidente of the Commerce Guild &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Cat Miin&mdash;Aide of Shu Mai &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Passel Argente&mdash;Senator of Kooriva and Magistrate of the Corporate Alliance &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Denaria Kee&mdash;Associate Planetary Representative of Kooriva &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Passel Argente's uncle\n\n\u2022 Oro Dassyne &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Po Nudo&mdash;Senator of Ando and Leader of the Hyper-Communications Cartel &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Nank Tun &dagger; &mdash;Aide to Nudo &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Tikkes&mdash;Senator of Dac and later the Quarren Isolation League &dagger;\n\n\u2022 B'olba&mdash;Associate Planetary Representative of Dac and later the Quarren Isolation League &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Tracton&mdash;Aide to Tikkes &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Rogwa Wodrata&mdash;Senator of Alliga and the Phelleem sector\n\n\u2022 The Most High Queen of Zygerria Miraj Scintel&mdash;Queen of Zygerria &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Atai Molec&mdash;Prime Minister of Zygerria and the Captain of the Guard to Miraj Scintel\n\nThese individuals represented eight independent galactic governments, that made up the Confederacy, including the Trade Federation, Techno Union, InterGalactic Banking Clan, Geonosian Industries, Commerce Guild, Corporate Alliance, Hyper-Communications Cartel, and Quarren Isolation League. Eight worlds (all the origins of the leading species) were the capitals of the eight separatist governments, including Neimoidia, Skako, Muunilinst, Geonosis, Castell, Kooriva, Ando and Dac. Although the governments were affiliated with each other into one galactic government against the Galactic Republic, each had played their own part in the Separatist Crisis from 24 BBY&ndash; 22 BBY and the Clone Wars that followed, from 22 BBY&ndash; 19 BBY.\nRepublic Senators who joined the cause:\n\u2022 Toonbuck Toora&mdash;Senator of Sy Myrth &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Sy Myrthian Aide&mdash;Associate Planetary Representative of Sy Myrth\n\n\u2022 Baron Rush Clovis&mdash;Senator of Scipio and the InterGalactic Banking Clan &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Nix Card&mdash;Associate Planetary Representative of the InterGalactic Banking Clan\n\n\u2022 Mak Plain&mdash;Associate Planetary Representative of the InterGalactic Banking Clan\n\n\u2022 Prince Tal Merrik&mdash;Senator of Kalevala &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Lott Dod&mdash;Senator of Neimoidia and the Trade Federation\n\n\u2022 Mik Regrap&mdash;Associate Planetary Representative of Neimoidia and the Trade Federation and a Trade Baron\n\n\u2022 Beolars Bribbs&mdash;President of the Sullustan Council, CEO of SoroSuub Corporation and Senator of Sullust\n\n\u2022 Navi&mdash;Senator of Thustra\n\n\u2022 Moje&mdash;Associate Planetary Representative of Thustra\n\n\u2022 ViensaiMalloc&mdash;Senator of Devaron Space &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Corlissi Ludar&mdash;Senator of Sluis Van and the Sluis sector\n\n\u2022 Dodra Fass&mdash;Senator of Clak'dor VII and the Mayagil sector\n\n\u2022 Rodd&mdash;Senator of Fondor and the Tapani sector\n\n\u2022 Esu Rotsino&mdash;Senator of Abrion Major and the Abrion sector\n\n\u2022 Daggibus Scoritoles&mdash;Senator of YagDhul\n\n\u2022 Tyreca Bremack&mdash;Senator of Agamar and the Lahara sector\n\n\u2022 Zurros&mdash;Senator of Falleen\n\n\u2022 Wuja Wojaine&mdash;Senator of Mortex sector\n\n\u2022 Onaconda Farr&mdash;Senator of Rodia (Briefly allied to the Confederacy) &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Lolo Purs&mdash;Aide of Farr and Associate Planetary Representative of Rodia (Briefly)\n\n\u2022 Gume Saam&mdash;Senator of Tibrin (Affiliated with the Confederacy)\n\n\u2022 Waks Trode&mdash;Associate Planetary Representative of Tibrin\n\n\u2022 Havriso Looruya&mdash; Senator of Yir Tangee\n\n\u2022 Silvu Donte&mdash; Senator of Riflor\n\n\u2022 Mousul&mdash; Senator of Ansion\n\n\u2022 Unidentified Senator &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Viento &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Bezz Drexx (Received bribes from the Separatists)\n\n\u2022 Ronet Coorr (Received bribes from the Separatists)\n\n\u2022 The senators of the Separatist Parliament included:\n\n\u2022 Voe Atell\n\n\u2022 By Bluss\n\n\u2022 Mina Bonteri&mdash;Senator of Onderon &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Lux Bonteri&mdash;Senator of Onderon after his mother's death (Briefly)\n\n\u2022 Amita Fonti\n\n\u2022 Kerch Kushi\n\n\u2022 Bec Lawise &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Punn Rimbaud\n\nOther members of power included:\n\u2022 Karina the Great&mdash;Geonosian Queen &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Alaric&mdash;Sephi King of Thustra &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Ado Eemon&mdash;Ruler of Caramm V\n\n\u2022 Candobar Inglet&mdash;Khedive of the Sluis sector and Sluis Van\n\n\u2022 Nossor Ri&mdash; Chieftan of the Quarren Isolation League\n\n\u2022 Riff Tamson&mdash;Warlord of Karkaris &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Merai &mdash; Admiral of Dac &dagger;\n\n\u2022 Belo Tusus&mdash;Ruler of Orto\n\n\u2022 Pre Vizsla&mdash;Governor of Concordia, leader of the Death Watch.

These individuals were not warriors or generals, but merchants, more interested in commerce than battle, and thus were ill-equipped to lead troops into battle. Of the entire political leadership, only Count Dooku, Poggle the Lesser, and Nute Gunray had any experience in warfare, although some of the Council members had skills with leading, like Wat Tambor, who was renowned as a superior strategist by many.Boba Fett: A New Threat Other military officials included General Whorm Loathsom, General Oro Dassyne, General Lok Durd and Commander Merai. Sentepeth Findos, later the Acting Viceroy of the Trade Federation was a lieutenant.\nThe CIS military was primarily composed of battle droids, weapons and ships that were once used by the leadership's corporations as private security. Pooling their droid forces together, the CIS had managed to create can army so massive that it could potentially overthrow the Republic and was generally referred as the droid army. While mostly formed of droids, various organic forces also fought for the CIS forces during the war including bounty hunters, smugglers, and even Dark Jedi with many of them serving as high ranking officers. Various worlds that joined the CIS also had their militaries assimilated into the CIS.\nThe CIS leaders believed their superior numbers and advanced droid designs would win the Clone Wars and in some ways they were right, with Droidekas being able to use weaponry and shields capable of killing Jedi, and Battle Droids and Super Battle Droids capable of overwhelming forces with sheer numbers that the clones couldn't contend with. However, the incompetence of some droids, like the B1 battle droids, lost the CIS many skirmishes.\nOne of the largest contributions was by the Techno Union, which donated not only its new B2 super battle droids, but numerous foundries capable of producing thousands more droids for the Confederacy. Other companies that supported the Separatist's included Colla Designs, Phlac-Arphocc Automata Industries, Baktoid Industries, Haor Chall Engineering, Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps, Republic Sienar Systems, Retail Clan, and Feethan Ottraw Scalable Assemblies.\nat the First Battle of Geonosis.]]\nOther allies were quick to offer help. The Confederacy controlled countless worlds across the galaxy, and was able to recruit many of their local forces to the cause. The Jabiimi Separatist leader Alto Stratuss Nimbus commandos, the Quarren Isolation League, the Mandalorian Protectors, and many more aided the CIS in fighting the Galactic Republic. The Separatist Army also used a number of organic forces, from Gossam Commandos to Koorivar Fusiliers, they brought new tactics onto the field and were capable of independent thought and the use of real time military strategy that could give them an advantage over the AI of droids and many could rival even the Republics Clone Troopers capabilities.\nAs the leader of the CIS, Dooku also served as the supreme leader of its military forces and lead various high priority operations with the intent of quickly ending the war. Knowing that the battle droids used textbook tactics during battle, Dooku would often hire various mercenaries, bounty hunters, and smugglers to both take command of the droid forces to help give them an advantage. Given his vast wealth, Dooku would some of the galaxys most notorious contractors including Jango Fett, Durge/Legends, Cydon Prax, Cad Bane, and several others who often accepted these jobs due to the large pay. Aside from hiring mercenaries to fight for the CIS, Dooku also recruited various Dark Jedi to either train as his own apprentices or simply help combat the Jedi Generals. Among these Dark Acolytes were Asajj Ventress, Savage Opress, and Sora Bulq.\nBridging the gap between organic and automation was: General Grievous, Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. A cyborg with a brilliant tactical mind and a powerful armored body, Grievous turned the war in favor of the Confederacy. He led his troops to a number of victories across the galaxy including the conquest of Duro and the destruction of Humbarine, the attacks of strategic Loyalist worlds, and spearheaded an assault towards Coruscant itself capturing the leader of the Republic Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in the process. He also targeted the Jedi Knights &mdash; particularly problematic to the droid army &mdash; and killed many in one on one combat. He had ultimate power over his troops, able to command them with but a gesture. One thing that made him a force to be reckoned with was his use of four lightsabers, from a personal collection of his taken from fallen Jedi Generals he had bested in combat. With the use of weapons to such a proficiency he was able to crush all in his path, leading to countless victories for the CIS. Asajj Ventress and the bounty hunter Durge were also effective commanders on the battlefield.\nThe Separatist Army was not merely composed of ground troops. It also deployed much larger weapons of war during the Clone Wars. Commerce Guild OG-9 homing spider droids were a common sight on Confederate frontlines, and NR-N99 Persuader Tank Droids, Manta Droid Subfighters, and Federation AATs provided heavy firepower in countless conflicts. Added to this the use of super weaponry such as the powerful Protodeka, the massive Seismic tank, and the terrible Dark Reaper. However, weaknesses found in these machines were often exploited by the Republic.\n\n\u2022 Astrography\n\nThe territory of the Confederacy of Independent Systems varied in size a great deal during the course of its short history. As of 22 BBY, the Confederacy of Independent Systems numbered at several thousand star systems, as well as the various commercial factions with the planets they controlled, allied under its banner.\nZygerria]]\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe Confederacy of Independent Systems first appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Early in production of Attack of the Clones, the various commerce guilds were to all employ the same type of battle droids that were used by the Trade Federation, albeit with different color schemes to differentiate allegiance, but it was later decided that having each guild have their own wholly unique droids would provide visual diversity.dwarf spider droid\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nEmpire 32]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Under a Black Sun\n\n\u2022 Beyond the Rim\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Onslaught at Arda I\n\n\u2022 Walking the Path That's Given\n\n\u2022 The Life and Legend of Obi-Wan Kenobi\n\n\u2022 The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader\n\n\u2022 Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Survivor's Quest Survivor's Quest (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines Separatists\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: Revenge of the Brick\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 film\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 game\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles video game\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: Microfighters video game\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStay on Target]]\n\u2022 Lords of Nal Hutta\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Strongholds of Resistance\n\n\u2022 Forged in Battle\n\n\u2022 Endless Vigil\n\n\u2022\n\nSeparatist holdouts]]\n\n\u2022 Non-canon sources\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Dark Side\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",

But unlike Coruscant&mdash;which was only relatively rundown and dangerous on the lower and under levels of the [[Planet/Legends|world]] city&mdash;Nar Shaddaa was filthy, polluted, and infested with crime everywhere.

The moon was about 4750 [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometres]] in diameter and served as the main [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] for the [[Hutt Cartel/Legends|Hutt Cartel]] on Nal Hutta.<ref name=\"TEA\" /><ref name=\"TEGtPaM\" />\n\nNar Shaddaa was tidally-locked to Nal Hutta, which resulted in the fact that only one side (the near side) of the moon always faced the parent planet, while the other side (the far side) was faced towards the empty space. Because of its tidal locking and orbit around Nal Hutta, both sides of the moon spent half of the year in daylight and the other half \u2013 in nighttime. Since Nar Shaddaa was close enough to its parent planet, its orbit was well inside Nal Hutta\u2019s [[Magnetic field/Legends|magnetic field]], which gave the moon protection from stellar radiation and cosmic rays. The moon was also protected by [[planetary shield]]s.<ref name=\"SWDEAD1_08_21\">[[Dark Empire (audio drama)|''Dark Empire'' audio drama]], at 1:08:20</ref> \n\nNar Shaddaa had a relatively large and dense metallic core, which allowed the moon to have an almost near standard-type surface [[Gravity/Legends|gravity]] like [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] despite only having a diameter of roughly 4800 [[Kilometer|kilometres]]. Its high density was explained by having large quantities of heavy elements like [[Iron/Legends|iron]], [[nickel]], [[Neutronium/Legends|neutronium]], [[Zersium/Legends|zersium]], [[gold]], [[plutonium]] and [[uranium]] in its core and crust. These elements contributed of having vast amounts of [[mining]] installations<ref name=\"TCSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> and [[Durasteel/Legends|durasteel]] production plants in the moon\u2019s early history, allowing for a rapid and cheap industrialization of Nar Shaddaa\u2019s surface. It is no wonder that many [[Mining/Legends|mines]] were still in operation during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. [[Ore/Legends|Ores]] from deep in the crust were loaded to a conveyor belt that emerged from the surface, and climbing a massive spiraling ramp, reached the loading docks high above.<ref name=\"RA\" />\n\n===Surface===\n{{Quote|This place is different from Coruscant.

For administrative purposes the cityscape of Nar Shaddaa was divided into many sectors ([[Corellian Sector (Nar Shaddaa)/Legends|Corellian Sector]], [[Duros Sector]] etc.), which in turn were divided into smaller districts. Likewise similarly to Coruscant and [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] new layers of housing and entertainment buildings were built on top of older layers, which resulted in the construction of massive vertical cities reaching heights of up to three kilometres.<ref name=\"TEGtPaM\" /><ref name=\"RAaudio\">[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent (audio drama)|''Dark Forces: Rebel Agent'' audio drama]]</ref> Power plants and their massive exhaust pots, venting off the excessive heat, made the levels nearer to the moon's surface warmer and hotter, encouraging the residents to build structures further up.<ref name=\"RA\">''[[Star Wars: Rebel Agent]]''</ref> In total Nar Shaddaa had about 100 levels of urban layers, of which the lower half made up what is known as the moon\u2019s [[Nar Shaddaa's Undercity|Undercity]].\n\nUnlike Coruscant's ecumenopolis, on which the Upper City was usually safe, both the upper levels and the Undercity of Nar Shaddaa were extremely dangerous.<ref name=\"TEGtPaM\" /> The only difference between the upper levels and the Undercity was that the lower levels of Nar Shaddaa didn\u2019t receive any sunlight whatsoever, being constantly illuminated by artificial lighting. Similarly to Coruscant the cityscape of Nar Shaddaa created its own microclimates, in which both the upper levels and the Undercity was profound to certain heat, wind and moisture patterns. Although, because of planetary engineering and constant maintenance from the local authorities, Nar Shaddaa's climate was moderately temperate<ref name=\"db\" /> with considerable air pollution getting worse by going lower towards the moon's surface. \n\nThe entire ecumenopolis was dominated by decaying urban landscape<ref name=\"TEGtPaM\" /> and congested, polluted areas, in contrast to the gleaming apartments and well-maintained skywalks that made up much of Coruscant. The urban surface of Nar Shaddaa consisted of several docking towers, [[Spaceport/Legends|landing bays]], cargo warehouses, [[Factory/Legends|factories]], residential buildings, promenades and trading plazas.<ref name=\"TEGtPaM\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: The Old Republic\">''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''</ref> The inconsistently-shaped buildings, some cylindrical, some polygonal, looked like trunks of some growing organism, and the population around them like [[symbiote]]s. The cityscape was anarchically constructed as anyone was able to build unregulated their own gantries, spires, bridges, platforms and signs anywhere that was convenient for them, creating navigational hazards. Some of the signs were deliberately deceptive, which would lead many into a trap where they would be mugged and/or killed.<ref name=\"RA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Old Republic===\n[[File:Narshaddaa_rgb-lg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cityscape of Nar Shaddaa]]\n\nWhen the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] left their homeworld of [[Varl/Legends|Varl]], they displaced the [[Evocii]], native to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], to Nar Shaddaa in [[15,000 BBY/Legends|15,000 BBY]] and immediately destroyed the remaining Evocii agriculture. Eventually the moon was annexed by the Hutts, who started to force the Evocii into slave labor, completely changing the moon's unknown original natural terrain, by building spaceports and docking bays across its surface - some stretching out into orbit. Although the moon's urbanized construction had just started, it quickly began to prosper, along with Nal Hutta.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nBy [[14,500 BBY]], the moon was completely urbanized, and the Evocii were finally free since their work was complete. However most had died off during the construction and the few that remained, took refuge in the [[Nar Shaddaa's Undercity|Undercity]]. Unfortunately the Evocii began to mutate into unwholesome savages due to various technologies practiced in the moon's undercity. For about eleven thousand years, it [[Coruscant of the Outer Rim|rivaled]] the galactic capital [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] as an important center of interstellar trade and continued to grow.<ref name=\"db\" /> In [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]] when the trade lanes shifted, Nar Shaddaa and its planet became obsolete and were eventually abandoned by the Republic.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\n\nNar Shaddaa became a criminal haven and gained a reputation of being the center of illegal operations in the galaxy, earning the moniker \"The Smugglers' Moon\". Now distant from most galactic trade centers, the moon was allowed to run its own affairs with little outside interference.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nSections of the urbanized moon's vertical city included the [[Duros Sector]] and the [[Corellian Sector (Nar Shaddaa)/Legends|Corellian sector]], which contained three bars popular with [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] &mdash; [[The Burning Deck]], [[Slag Pit/Legends|The Slag Pit]], and the [[Meltdown Caf\u00e9]]&mdash;as well as another corner tavern called the [[Orange Lady]].\n\n====First Jedi Purge====\nIn [[3951 BBY]], the moon was visited by the [[Meetra Surik|Jedi Exile]] in her search for [[Zez-Kai Ell]], a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] who cast her out of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi Order]]. After the [[Jedi Civil War]] ended, Nar Shaddaa became swarmed by thousands&mdash;if not millions&mdash;of refugees from destroyed worlds across the Galaxy, and still more ex-soldiers from both sides in the conflict choking up its spaces looking for work and / or new homes. Its refugee sector was one of the most crowded in the entire galaxy, and tightly controlled by the [[Exchange]]. The Exchange was exploiting the refugees to lure any remaining Jedi into their hands. The Exile attracted the Exchange's attention by persuading [[Saquesh]], the \"Overseer\", to loosen his grip on the Refugee Sector, and rescuing locals from Exchange thugs. After she went to the Jekk'Jekk Tarr to meet with the Exchange member [[Visquis]], [[G0-T0]] intervened in Visquis' attempts to kill the Jedi and collected a misinterpreted \"bounty\".

The Hutt crime lords preferred a none-interventionist policy towards public safety, in which the local authorities could spend their [[Galactic Credit Standard/Legends|credits]] on infrastructure, entertainment, smuggling operations and other illicit activities. However, the open market system provided the ability to hire [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] for capturing wanted fugitives or other perpetrators.

    "plain_text": "1\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords\nNar Shaddaa was the largest moon of Nal Hutta. More commonly known as the Vertical City, the Smugglers' Moon, Little Coruscant, or derisively as Little Slugland,Galaxywide NewsNets and in shorthand slang as Narsh, Nar Shaddaa was similar to Coruscant in that its surface was entirely overgrown with city sprawl for millennia. But unlike Coruscant&mdash;which was only relatively rundown and dangerous on the lower and under levels of the world city&mdash;Nar Shaddaa was filthy, polluted, and infested with crime everywhere. Nevertheless Nar Shaddaa remained the most important financial and trading center of Hutt Space.\n\n\u2022 Description\n\n\u2022 Overview\n\nVisas Marr\nNar Shaddaa was the largest moon of Nal Hutta, located within the YToub system of Hutt Space on the borderline between the Mid Rim and Outer Rim Territories. The moon was about 4750 kilometres in diameter and served as the main spaceport for the Hutt Cartel on Nal Hutta.\nNar Shaddaa was tidally-locked to Nal Hutta, which resulted in the fact that only one side (the near side) of the moon always faced the parent planet, while the other side (the far side) was faced towards the empty space. Because of its tidal locking and orbit around Nal Hutta, both sides of the moon spent half of the year in daylight and the other half \u2013 in nighttime. Since Nar Shaddaa was close enough to its parent planet, its orbit was well inside Nal Hutta\u2019s magnetic field, which gave the moon protection from stellar radiation and cosmic rays. The moon was also protected by planetary shields.Dark Empire audio drama, at 1:08:20\nNar Shaddaa had a relatively large and dense metallic core, which allowed the moon to have an almost near standard-type surface gravity like Coruscant despite only having a diameter of roughly 4800 kilometres. Its high density was explained by having large quantities of heavy elements like iron, nickel, neutronium, zersium, gold, plutonium and uranium in its core and crust. These elements contributed of having vast amounts of mining installationsThe Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia and durasteel production plants in the moon\u2019s early history, allowing for a rapid and cheap industrialization of Nar Shaddaa\u2019s surface. It is no wonder that many mines were still in operation during the Galactic Civil War. Ores from deep in the crust were loaded to a conveyor belt that emerged from the surface, and climbing a massive spiraling ramp, reached the loading docks high above.\n\n\u2022 Surface\n\nDarksaber]]\nCenturies of industrialization left Nar Shaddaa\u2019s surface highly urbanized, which in turn forced the moon to become an ecumenopolis \u2013 a global wide cityscape. For administrative purposes the cityscape of Nar Shaddaa was divided into many sectors (Corellian Sector, Duros Sector etc.), which in turn were divided into smaller districts. Likewise similarly to Coruscant and Taris new layers of housing and entertainment buildings were built on top of older layers, which resulted in the construction of massive vertical cities reaching heights of up to three kilometres.Dark Forces: Rebel Agent audio drama Power plants and their massive exhaust pots, venting off the excessive heat, made the levels nearer to the moons surface warmer and hotter, encouraging the residents to build structures further up.Star Wars: Rebel Agent In total Nar Shaddaa had about 100 levels of urban layers, of which the lower half made up what is known as the moon\u2019s Undercity.\nUnlike Coruscants ecumenopolis, on which the Upper City was usually safe, both the upper levels and the Undercity of Nar Shaddaa were extremely dangerous. The only difference between the upper levels and the Undercity was that the lower levels of Nar Shaddaa didn\u2019t receive any sunlight whatsoever, being constantly illuminated by artificial lighting. Similarly to Coruscant the cityscape of Nar Shaddaa created its own microclimates, in which both the upper levels and the Undercity was profound to certain heat, wind and moisture patterns. Although, because of planetary engineering and constant maintenance from the local authorities, Nar Shaddaas climate was moderately temperate with considerable air pollution getting worse by going lower towards the moon's surface.\nThe entire ecumenopolis was dominated by decaying urban landscape and congested, polluted areas, in contrast to the gleaming apartments and well-maintained skywalks that made up much of Coruscant. The urban surface of Nar Shaddaa consisted of several docking towers, landing bays, cargo warehouses, factories, residential buildings, promenades and trading plazas.Star Wars: The Old Republic The inconsistently-shaped buildings, some cylindrical, some polygonal, looked like trunks of some growing organism, and the population around them like symbiotes. The cityscape was anarchically constructed as anyone was able to build unregulated their own gantries, spires, bridges, platforms and signs anywhere that was convenient for them, creating navigational hazards. Some of the signs were deliberately deceptive, which would lead many into a trap where they would be mugged and/or killed.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Old Republic\n\nWhen the Hutts left their homeworld of Varl, they displaced the Evocii, native to Nal Hutta, to Nar Shaddaa in 15,000 BBY and immediately destroyed the remaining Evocii agriculture. Eventually the moon was annexed by the Hutts, who started to force the Evocii into slave labor, completely changing the moons unknown original natural terrain, by building spaceports and docking bays across its surface - some stretching out into orbit. Although the moons urbanized construction had just started, it quickly began to prosper, along with Nal Hutta.\nBy 14,500 BBY, the moon was completely urbanized, and the Evocii were finally free since their work was complete. However most had died off during the construction and the few that remained, took refuge in the Undercity. Unfortunately the Evocii began to mutate into unwholesome savages due to various technologies practiced in the moons undercity. For about eleven thousand years, it rivaled the galactic capital Coruscant as an important center of interstellar trade and continued to grow. In 4000 BBY when the trade lanes shifted, Nar Shaddaa and its planet became obsolete and were eventually abandoned by the Republic.\nNar Shaddaa became a criminal haven and gained a reputation of being the center of illegal operations in the galaxy, earning the moniker \"The Smugglers' Moon\". Now distant from most galactic trade centers, the moon was allowed to run its own affairs with little outside interference.\nSections of the urbanized moon's vertical city included the Duros Sector and the Corellian sector, which contained three bars popular with bounty hunters &mdash; The Burning Deck, The Slag Pit, and the Meltdown Caf\u00e9&mdash;as well as another corner tavern called the Orange Lady.\n\n\u2022 First Jedi Purge\n\nIn 3951 BBY, the moon was visited by the Jedi Exile in her search for Zez-Kai Ell, a Jedi Master who cast her out of the Jedi Order. After the Jedi Civil War ended, Nar Shaddaa became swarmed by thousands&mdash;if not millions&mdash;of refugees from destroyed worlds across the Galaxy, and still more ex-soldiers from both sides in the conflict choking up its spaces looking for work and / or new homes. Its refugee sector was one of the most crowded in the entire galaxy, and tightly controlled by the Exchange. The Exchange was exploiting the refugees to lure any remaining Jedi into their hands. The Exile attracted the Exchanges attention by persuading Saquesh, the \"Overseer\", to loosen his grip on the Refugee Sector, and rescuing locals from Exchange thugs. After she went to the JekkJekk Tarr to meet with the Exchange member Visquis, G0-T0 intervened in Visquis attempts to kill the Jedi and collected a misinterpreted \"bounty\". However, her companions rescued her and they succeeded in destroying G0-T0s yacht, the Visionary, destabilizing the Exchange and other criminal organizations throughout the entire sector for many years.\n\n\u2022 Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, both Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire were vying for alliances with the Hutt Cartel. Several criminal organizations, including the Exchange, continued to be active on the moon in this period, struggling against one another for control of the criminal underworld.\nIn 3653 BBY the Exchange suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of Shadow Syndicate, even being driven out of the Corellian Sector.\nDuring the occupation by the Eternal Empire, Nar Shaddaa was the site of a Star Fortress.\n\n\u2022 New Sith Wars\n\nAround 1002 BBY, the Brotherhood of Darkness operated a Sith academy on the world that specialized in the training of Sith assassins. In 1000 BBY, after the Ruusan campaign, Set Harth and Bal Serinus dueled on the moon, but were both imprisoned by a Hutt crimelord.The Dark Side Sourcebook\n\n\u2022 The decline of the Republic\n\nStar Wars (1998) 19]]\nBefore her death in 32 BBY at the hands of Darth Maul, native-born Palowick Aneesa Dym and her ship the Dusty Duck called the Smugglers' Moon home.Dusty Duck\nIn 28 BBY, the Colicoids took over the spice processing on Nar Shaddaa, thanks to the efforts of Jedi Siri Tachi.Jedi Quest: Path to Truth Han Solo spent part of his early career as a smuggler on Nar Shaddaa. There, he learned the tricks of the smuggling trade from some of the galaxys best smugglers such as Salla Zend, Shug Ninx and Roa. He had an apartment on the Smugglers' Moon, which was maintained by his old house-keeping droid ZeeZee, but after he decided to leave the moon for the Corporate Sector, it was left unused.\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire\n\nDark Forces Official Player's Guide\nAfter the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nar Shaddaas citizenry celebrated for an entire month. They were overjoyed by the regime change not because of what it meant for the galaxy, but because the Empire was turning its attention inward and they hoped that that would give them more leeway for their illegal activities.Millennium Falcon'\nIn 3 BBY, Galen Marek journeyed to Nar Shaddaa under the orders of Darth Vader to execute the Jedi Rahm Kota, who was attacking the critical Imperial shipyard in Nar Shaddaa's orbit. During the duel between the two Force-adepts in the control room, the controls were destroyed, causing the facility to fall toward the moon.\narrives on Nar Shaddaa.]]\nWhile it was falling, a blinded Kota fell out of a window, but was protected by the Force and made his way to the undercity of Nar Shaddaa and became an alcoholic. Rahm Kota was rescued by Bail Organa and Marek by Juno Eclipse. In 2 BBY, Marek returned to Nar Shaddaa, hoping to find Kota, whom he knew had not died in their duel. Although the Jedi had left Nar Shaddaa by the time Marek arrived, Marek was able to pick up Kota's trail, eventually tracking him to Bespin.\nJaxxon and Amaiza Foxtrain teamed up as smugglers, headquartered on the moon. Lando Calrissian also spent his early career on Nar Shaddaa. Prior to serving Raymus Antilles, C-3PO and R2-D2 traveled to the Smugglers Moon in an attempt to apprehend the criminal, Olag Greck. The bounty hunter Greedo and his family lived in the moons Corellian sector for several years, until an Imperial attack on a Rebel hideout resulted in the destruction and collapse of nearly twenty sector levels.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Rebel agent Kyle Katarn traveled to Nar Shaddaa in order to find Imperial navigational charts related to the Dark Trooper Project; the Imperials had already put a bounty on his head which resulted in a skirmish in the streets.\n\n\u2022 New Republic\n\nStar Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast\nAfter the Battle of Endor the Empire lost its jurisdiction there, although arrogant Imperials continued to harrass citizens by pretending to have authority.\nIn 5 ABY Katarn caused havoc once more while chasing the information broker droid 8t88 that had his fathers holodisc. When he found him, Kyle shot and severed the droids arm, and had to descend into the sewers to find the disc before ascending and being picked up by Jan Ors.\nIn 10 ABY, Han Solo returned with his wife, Leia Organa Solo. During the trip, Leia met Purge survivor named Vima-Da-Boda, who gave her an ancient lightsaber. When he returned to his apartment, it was still being maintained by ZeeZee. Unfortunately, there was yet another surprise for him&mdash;the dreaded bounty hunter Boba Fett, waiting on Nar Shaddaa to capture Solo. After a chase through the streets of Nar Shaddaa, they escaped along with Solos former comrades Salla Zend and Shug Ninx on the Millennium Falcon and the Starlight Intruder' to Byss.\n.]]\nLater that year, while en route to New Alderaan, Han and Leia along with his smuggler friends returned to Nar Shaddaa. Upon arriving at the city moon, they discovered an Imperial presence in the form of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Invincible, which was under the command of the Dark Jedi Zasm Katth and Baddon Fass. During an adventure through Nar Shaddaas broken-down cities, they encountered Gank bounty hunters, Boba Fett, Imperial troops, and deadly vrblthers. The Solos also met Vima again, and this time, took her with them. As they were leaving Nar Shaddaa, they were met with resistance from Mako Spince and the Invincible, though they also managed to escape. During the escape, the Invincible attempted to capture the Falcon, though unfortunately it dragged the skyscraper where Mako Spince was located. As a result, the Invincible' crashed onto the surrounding cityscape, causing heavy damage to lives and property.\nIn 12 ABY while looking for Desann, Kyle Katarn once more returned to the city and looked for a Rodian crimelord Reelo Baruk. He freed Lando Calrissian from Baruks hold and eventually found him; however the gangster managed to entrap him in a room full of turrets, but the Jedi escaped. Katarn and Calrissian managed to find Lady Luck and refuel her, using pipelines. When they were about to make their escape from Nar Shaddaa, Reelo attacked them with a handful of mercenaries. The criminal used a gun platform to hit the ship while his thugs boarded it, but Katarn leapt into the laser turret of the Lady Luck' and shot down the gangster.\nIn 14 ABY, it was discovered that Lannik Racto was manufacturing assassin droids in a hidden facility on the moon and selling them on the Invisible Market, until Jaden Korr captured him at his headquarters on Coruscant, where Racto revealed the location of the factory. Shortly after that, New Republic Intelligence raided the facility and thwarted its operations.Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy\n\n\u2022 Yuuzhan Vong Empire\n\nInvasion: Rescues 6]]\non Nar Shaddaa during the time of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion]]\nIn 26 ABY, the cities of the Smugglers' Moon were destroyed in an orbital bombardment by the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong. Most of the inhabitants were killed and the entire urban moon was reduced to rubble.\nThe mutant Evocii had been among the few survivors since they were living at the very moon surface itself and were not caught in the orbital bombardment.\nThe entire YToub system was surrounded by some of the Yuuzhan Vong's deadliest warships. Nar Shaddaa had several organic creations sent down to the remains of the surface for multiple purposes.\nDifferent types of bacteria killed off all of the remaining inhabitants. All the Evocii among them thus the Evocii on Nar Shaddaa became extinct, living in the undercity since their civilized ancestors had taken refuge down there in 15,000 BBY. Then all the carcasses, Evocii or not, were buried and dissolved into the soil of the original surface of Ground Zero.\nNext, all the rubble on the moon was broken down and absorbed into the soil. Thus Nar Shaddaa became a lifeless, barren world with no inhabitants. The surface of Nar Shaddaa was then Vongformed to suit the invaders.\nNar Shaddaa, along with Nal Hutta itself&mdash;and indeed all of the YToub system&mdash;in the Yuuzhan Vong's grasps was used as a stronghold in Hutt Space. The entire Hutt Oversector was swallowed up by the Yuuzhan Vong empire and began to desolate Hutt Space.\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\nFlitcher Poste relates a Vongformed planet's appearance to that of Nar Shaddaa during the Yuuzhan Vong War\nIn 29 ABY when the Yuuzhan Vong were defeated they abandoned the moon and Nal Hutta. Since Nar Shaddaa was Vongformed during the Yuuzhan Vong War, it did not yet return to the state of an ecumenopolis, though many small cities were built across the moon. It became a haven for smugglers once more in 29 ABY, and the Hutts eventually reclaimed Nar Shaddaa, rebuilding that which was destroyed.Legacy Era Campaign Guide The moon, along with the planet, joined the Confederation in 40 ABY, although the Hutts themselves were relatively neutral during the Second Galactic Civil War. Later in the war, however, the Hutts eventually joined their fellow non-Hutt criminals in the great conflict.\nBy 43 ABY, much of the worlds surface had been built over once more which again began to glimmer. Tobb Jadak, a former smuggler from the last days of the Galactic Republic, reflected on how similar Nar Shaddaa was to its original state years before the Vongforming. He also noticed that security on the world was much tighter than in the days of the Republic. The place where people went to quickly and easily disappear now required retinal and body scans to enter the moons spaceport.\n\n\u2022 Inhabitants\n\n\u2022 Immigrated species\n\nHistorically Nar Shaddaa didn\u2019t have any native inhabitants. The Evocii, who originally inhibited Evocar (Nal Hutta), were the first species, which around the year of 15,000 BBY were displaced on the moon\u2019s surface by the Hutts after the later took over the former\u2019s home world. Eventually the primitive Evocii were subjugated on the moon as well and used as cheap labour to build the global-wide cityscape of Nar Shaddaa. Centuries of harsh treatment and brutal working condition nearly eradicated the Evocii species, in which the remaining survivors mutated and continued to live in the lowest levels of Nar Shaddaa's Undercity. Alongside the Hutts and the Evocii, Nar Shaddaa was also inhibited by Vrblthers, reptilian-like humanoid predators, who patrolled the lower levels of the moon\u2019s cityscape and were originally brought from the Hutt home world of Varl as pets and guard beasts.\nMany types of beings, individuals and occupations could be seen on the streets: Wookiees, Twileks, Kubaz, Whiphids, Weequays, Bith sand artists, Ithorian herd merchants, Gamorrean guards, clone slaves, construction droids carrying individuals in sedans, Imperials and Imperial Commandoes acting as bodyguards.\n\n\u2022 Government and law enforcement\n\nthe Hutt was one of the crime lords, who ruled over Nar Shaddaa's Refugee Sector during the Old Republic era]]\nNar Shaddaa was governed by organized crime elements of the Hutt Cartel. The moon didn\u2019t had a capital area with a centralized bureaucratic government, but instead was run by multiple Hutt crime lords, who oversaw their operations from cantinas and other accommodated places. Each sector of Nar Shaddaas ecumenopolis was governed by a single Hutt crime lord, who was related to one of the kajidics on Nal Hutta. In general the crime lords of Nar Shaddaa were subordinate to the Grand Hutt Council on Nal Hutta, though it rarely interfered in the moons internal activities. While the city sectors were controlled by the Hutts, each district was governed by their vassals \u2013 mostly Exchange related thugs and other criminal entities, who had the rights to collect tribute in the form of fees and tolls from their respective areas (also in the form of extortion) and were obliged to pay a proportion of their income to their Hutt overlords. There were no legal courts, in which disputes could be prosecuted \u2013 all disagreements were resolved by bribing or in other ways influencing the decisions made by the Hutts and their respective vassals.\nNar Shaddaa didn\u2019t have any Planetary Security Forces, which could combat crime and ensure the safety of its local residents. The Hutt crime lords preferred a none-interventionist policy towards public safety, in which the local authorities could spend their credits on infrastructure, entertainment, smuggling operations and other illicit activities. However, the open market system provided the ability to hire bounty hunters for capturing wanted fugitives or other perpetrators. Those, who had the necessary credits, could also hire mercenaries for personal protection or engage in a voluntary militia by patrolling the surrounding streets of his or her own neighbourhood.\n\n\u2022 Economy\n\nAnything illegal elsewhere could be bought and sold on Nar Shaddaa, and many young smugglers, pirates and criminals started their careers on the Smugglers' Moon. Various sections of Nar Shaddaa were controlled by the Hutts and other criminal organizations.\nDespite the criminal activities on the Smugglers Moon, it was known that many of the galaxys most advanced technologies were actually developed on Nar Shaddaa. Corporations that wanted to avoid regulations that prohibited testing often developed such dangerous and even valuable technology within the lower levels of the city of the moon.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe galaxy map from Star Wars Insider 65 incorrectly identifies Nar Shaddaa as its own planet, while it is in fact the moon of Nal Hutta.Tasty Taste]]\nIn Darth Bane: Path of Destruction, Nar Shaddaa is spelled as \"Nar Shadaa\" with only one \"d\".Darth Bane: Path of Destruction\nNar Shaddaas first mention in the Dark Empire 3 endnotes identified Nar Shaddaa as the \"Smugglers Moon\".

Through their [[Sienar Design Systems/Legends|Sienar Design Systems]] subsidiary, they were also responsible for many drive and power systems.\n\n==History==\n[[File:SFS_old.svg|thumb|200px|A previous SFS logo.|left]]\nSienar Fleet Systems, along with [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]] and the [[Corellian Engineering Corporation/Legends|Corellian Engineering Corporation]], was one of the major suppliers of military [[Starship/Legends|vessels]] for the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]: whereas KDY was famous for designing massive [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]], SFS was best-known as the supplier of the small, yet deadly [[TIE series/Legends|TIE fighters]]. Yet SFS also created the massive [[I-a2b solar ionization reactor/Legends|I-a2b solar ionization reactor]] that powered the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] and dictated the size and design of its mile-long [[Hull/Legends|hull]]: in effect, KDY built the ''Imperial''-class around a huge Sienar drive system.\n\nSFS, originally [[Republic Sienar Systems/Legends|Republic Sienar Systems]], was founded [[15,000 BBY/Legends|over 15 millennia]] before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] by the wealthy [[Sienar family/Legends|Sienar family]], apparently on [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. Over the [[Millennium/Legends|millennia]], they produced designs such as the [[Unidentified Koros system battleship|Sienar Battleship]] and the [[Interdictor-class cruiser|''Interdictor''-class cruiser]]. A [[100 BBY/Legends|century before]] the Battle of [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin]], the Sienars united with the [[Santhe family/Legends|Santhe family]] of [[Lianna/Legends|Lianna]], who owned [[Santhe Security]], due to an arranged [[Marriage/Legends|marriage]]. Although this gave the Santhe family something of the status of a ruling dynasty within the merged Santhe/Sienar, scions of the Sienar lineage retained operational control of the ship-design section of the conglomerate: [[Parent/Legends|father]] and son [[Narro Sienar]] and [[Raith Sienar/Legends|Raith Sienar]] served as successive [[Chief Executive Officer/Legends|CEOs]] for many [[Standard year/Legends|years]] in the last [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]] and under the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\nUnder the covert patronage of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], Raith Sienar established [[Sienar Design Systems/Legends|Sienar Design Systems]] and its [[Sienar Advanced Projects Laboratory/Legends|Advanced Projects Laboratory]], which were apparently responsible for designing [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul's]] [[Scimitar/Legends|Sith Infiltrator]]: although Raith Sienar fiercely denied any connection to the craft, it does seem that it was connected to Advanced Projects designs, including the [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] prototypes that would develop into the [[Twin Ion Engine starfighter|T.I.E. starfighter]] and early TIE series designs. By [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]], Raith Sienar had also produced the original [[Expeditionary Battle Planetoid]] design that later became the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]]. Even after the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] ended with the [[Declaration of a New Order]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], the Sienar Fleet System, alongside Kuat Drive Yards, continued to produce [[Warship/Legends|warships]], ground vehicles and other war machines at a quick pace, because of Palpatine's desire to extend Imperial rule throughout the civilized [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. This in turn led to the [[Reconquest of the Rim]] taking place from [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]] to [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]].\n\n[[File:SIEN01AB.jpg|thumb|Sienar Fleet Systems' advertisement for the [[TIE/sa tactical bomber/Legends|TIE/sa bomber]].|left]]Under the Empire's rule, SFS produced an immense variety of military spacecraft. Most were relatively small&mdash;starfighters, [[patrol ship]]s and planetary defense pickets&mdash;but as well as the power systems for the ''Imperial''-class design, Sienar also built the 600 [[Meter/Legends|meter]] [[Vindicator-class heavy cruiser/Legends|''Vindicator''-class heavy cruiser]] to a design produced by [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]], and its [[Immobilizer 418 Interdictor-class Heavy Cruiser|Immobilizer 418]] interdictor variant.\n\nRaith Sienar seems to have remained in control of SFS until after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], but when he was killed in an assassination, [[Lady/Legends|Lady]] [[Valles Santhe]] of the Santhes dynasty took direct control of the company, and continued to control it after the collapse of the Empire. She then created [[Sienar Army Systems]] when the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] Palpatine was reborn in the body of a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]]. After the defeat of [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], the company began supplying vessels to all buyers, including the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].\n\nSFS was loyal to the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] by [[40 ABY]], producing the [[Freebooter-class transport|''Freebooter''-class transport]] and the [[Aleph-class starfighter|''Aleph''-class starfighter]]. By the time of the [[Sith\u2013Imperial War]], however, they were producing the [[Predator-class fighter|''Predator''-class fighter]] and other spacecraft for the [[Fel Empire|revived Empire]].<ref

Through their Sienar Design Systems subsidiary, they were also responsible for many drive and power systems.\n\n\u2022 History\n\nSienar Fleet Systems, along with Kuat Drive Yards and the Corellian Engineering Corporation, was one of the major suppliers of military vessels for the Galactic Empire: whereas KDY was famous for designing massive Star Destroyers, SFS was best-known as the supplier of the small, yet deadly TIE fighters. Yet SFS also created the massive I-a2b solar ionization reactor that powered the Imperial-class Star Destroyer and dictated the size and design of its mile-long hull: in effect, KDY built the Imperial-class around a huge Sienar drive system.\nSFS, originally Republic Sienar Systems, was founded over 15 millennia before the Battle of Yavin by the wealthy Sienar family, apparently on Corulag. Over the millennia, they produced designs such as the Sienar Battleship and the Interdictor-class cruiser. A century before the Battle of Yavin, the Sienars united with the Santhe family of Lianna, who owned Santhe Security, due to an arranged marriage. Although this gave the Santhe family something of the status of a ruling dynasty within the merged Santhe/Sienar, scions of the Sienar lineage retained operational control of the ship-design section of the conglomerate: father and son Narro Sienar and Raith Sienar served as successive CEOs for many years in the last decades of the Old Republic and under the Galactic Empire.\nUnder the covert patronage of Senator Palpatine, Raith Sienar established Sienar Design Systems and its Advanced Projects Laboratory, which were apparently responsible for designing Darth Mauls Sith Infiltrator: although Raith Sienar fiercely denied any connection to the craft, it does seem that it was connected to Advanced Projects designs, including the starfighter prototypes that would develop into the T.I.E. starfighter and early TIE series designs. By 29 BBY, Raith Sienar had also produced the original Expeditionary Battle Planetoid design that later became the Death Star. Even after the Clone Wars ended with the Declaration of a New Order in 19 BBY, the Sienar Fleet System, alongside Kuat Drive Yards, continued to produce warships, ground vehicles and other war machines at a quick pace, because of Palpatines desire to extend Imperial rule throughout the civilized galaxy. This in turn led to the Reconquest of the Rim taking place from 19 BBY to 17 BBY.\n.|left]]Under the Empires rule, SFS produced an immense variety of military spacecraft. Most were relatively small&mdash;starfighters, patrol ships and planetary defense pickets&mdash;but as well as the power systems for the Imperial-class design, Sienar also built the 600 meter Vindicator-class heavy cruiser to a design produced by Wilhuff Tarkin, and its Immobilizer 418 interdictor variant.\nRaith Sienar seems to have remained in control of SFS until after the Battle of Endor, but when he was killed in an assassination, Lady Valles Santhe of the Santhes dynasty took direct control of the company, and continued to control it after the collapse of the Empire. She then created Sienar Army Systems when the Emperor Palpatine was reborn in the body of a clone. After the defeat of Grand Admiral Thrawn, the company began supplying vessels to all buyers, including the New Republic.\nSFS was loyal to the Galactic Alliance by 40 ABY, producing the Freebooter-class transport and the Aleph-class starfighter. By the time of the Sith\u2013Imperial War, however, they were producing the Predator-class fighter and other spacecraft for the revived Empire.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nX-Wing Rogue Squadron 25]]\n\u2022 Dark Forces: Rebel Agent\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Rogue Squadron X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Wraith Squadron X-Wing: Wraith Squadron (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Solo Command X-Wing: Solo Command (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Dark Force Rising Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Isard's Revenge\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast\n\n\u2022 Vision of the Future Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Survivor's Quest Survivor's Quest (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Ylesia\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Betrayal\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Exile\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Fury\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStay on Target]]\n\u2022 Lords of Nal Hutta\n\n\u2022 Fly Casual\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Endless Vigil\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",

We can because we have power. We have power because we are Sith.|Sith Proverb|<ref name=\"SWGTCG\">{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|cardname=Rapacious Malice}}</ref>}}\nThe '''Sith''', also referred to as the '''Sith Order''' was a sect of [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitives]] who utilized the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. The term \"Sith\" originally referred to a [[Sith (species)/Legends|species of aliens]] native to the [[Planet/Legends|planets]] [[Korriban/Legends|Korriban]] and [[Ziost/Legends|Ziost]], who were later enslaved and ruled by [[Exiles|exiled]] [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. These Dark Jedi had once been members of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], a monastic [[The Force/Legends|Force]] religion dedicated to peace through the use of the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side of the Force]]. The Dark Jedi embraced the dark side, using its power to manipulate life, which started the [[Hundred-Year Darkness/Legends|Hundred-Year Darkness]]. However, they had been defeated and subsequently [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] from known space, which led to their discovery of the [[Sith (species)/Legends|Sith species.]] Following centuries of interbreeding and mixing of cultures between the aliens and the exiles, the Sith would no longer be identified by their race, but by their dedication to the ancient Sith philosophy. This religious order would survive in many different incarnations throughout [[Timeline of galactic history/Legends|galactic history]]. The rise of a new leader, or [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]], would often cause drastic reorganizations in the cult. However, the Sith would always be characterized by two key attributes: their lust for absolute power and their desire to destroy their ancient foes, the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]].\n\nThe Sith were the most infamous of all dark side religions, and the members of the cult were often seen as the pinnacle of power within the dark side. Throughout their long history, the Sith commanded several Empires and initiated many galactic wars. With such great influence, the Sith religion inspired many cults that weren't technically part of the Sith Order, nor did they consist of actual Sith. Instead, they were founded and made up of Sith devotees and other Force-sensitives dedicated to prolonging the teachings and the memory of the Sith. Such cults included the [[Naddist]]s, the [[Disciples of Ragnos]], and the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{Main|Dark side of the Force/Legends}}\n{{Quote|Empathy is a Jedi trait. Empathy leads to understanding. Understanding leads to compassion. Compassion leads to love. There is no place for love for a Sith. Only hate.|A [[Finn (Sith)|Sith master]] to his [[Finn's Sith apprentice|apprentice]]|<ref name=\"The Apprentice comic\">{{Tales|17|The Apprentice (comic story)}}</ref>}}\n\n===Forged by fire===\n[[File:DeathDarthRuyn.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Darth Talon]] kills [[Darth Ruyn|her master]].]]\nThe Sith believed that conflict was the only true test of one's ability, and so emphasized its importance. It was their belief that conflict challenged both individuals and civilizations, and so forced them to grow and evolve. They believed that harmony and the avoidance of conflict and that the pacifist teachings of the Jedi resulted in stagnation and decline.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''</ref>\n\nAnother purpose conflict served was the elevation of the strong and the [[Death/Legends|death]] of the weak. By encouraging strife, the strong were able to exercise their power while the weak were weeded from the ranks of the Sith. A core tenet of Sith philosophy was self-reliance and the idea that an individual only deserved what they were strong enough to take. Likewise, morality was treated as an obstacle to be overcome, as it got in the way of a Sith's ability to recognize and seize opportunities for advancement and self-empowerment.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" /> According to the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi shortly before [[Duel on Mustafar/Legends|dueling]] his former friend Anakin Skywalker, turned Sith Lord [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], a Sith's essential characteristic is \"dealing in absolutes.\"<ref name=\"SW3\">{{Film|III}}</ref>\n\nSuch philosophies were [[Sith training|embraced]] and taught at [[Sith academy|Sith academies]], where students were encouraged to challenge one another and fight for [[prestige]] that would be recognized by the headmaster of the academy. At the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|academy on Korriban]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]], students were tasked with gaining prestige so they might become one of the \"chosen few\" accepted into the ranks of [[Darth Malak]]'s [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]]. The strife to achieve prestige caused rivalries and animosity between the students, as there were few tasks that offered prestige, and many prospective Sith.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Similarly, the students of the academy during the [[New Sith Wars]] were pitted against each other in dueling sessions atop the academy. It was during these dueling sessions that intense rivalries were formed - rivalries that resulted in the deaths of students [[Fohargh]] and [[Sirak]] at the hands of [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]].<ref name=\"PoD\">''[[Darth Bane: Path of Destruction]]''</ref>\n\n===Empowered by passion===\n{{Quote|What fuels your power with the Force but your passion? The stronger, darker emotions. Anger, hatred, fear&hellip; these passions empower us.|Yuthura Ban|<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" />}}\n<div style=\"float:right\">[[File:Anakinchoke.png|thumb|250px|[[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] [[Telekinesis/Legends|choking]] his wife in anger]]</div>\nThe cornerstone of a Sith's power was passion. While the Jedi taught that fear, anger, and pain of loss were to be overcome, the Sith believed that these strong emotions were aided individuals in their survival. By harnessing their base emotions rather than being mindful about them, the Sith believed they could achieve true power. This belief was in stark contrast to that of the Jedi, who strived to avoid to be slaves of those emotions. Indeed, the Sith saw passion as the only real way to fully understand the Force. Sith taught to unleash their negative emotions<ref name=\"Witches of the Mist\">{{TCW|Witches of the Mist}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> and hoped to keep their passions under control by reminding themselves of the pain of loss, agonizingly sacrificing things and people they hold dear.<ref name=\"Legacy of the Force: Betrayal\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]''</ref>\n\nEmpathy, compassion, mercy and other emotions were anathema to the Sith. They often, but not always,<ref name=\":0\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines]]''</ref> like the Jedi, considered romantic love a dangerous emotion, but for different reasons. While the Jedi discouraged romance in order to prevent attachments, Sith did the same to prevent emotions deemed weak by them. However, this didn't stop some Sith from taking lovers. [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]] had maintained a relationship with fellow Sith pupil [[Githany]], however he did not allow himself to retain any connections to her and did not regret her death on [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]].<ref name=\"PoD\" /> Similarly [[Darth Malgus]] had a lover named [[Eleena Daru]]. In Malgus's case however, he eventually killed Daru as he believed that she constituted an intolerable weakness.<ref name=\"ToR:Deceived\">''[[The Old Republic: Deceived]]''</ref>\n\nRegardless, some Sith did have families, either marrying other Sith, or on some occasions having already had lovers and children from before their fall to the dark side\u2014the latter sometimes turning to the dark side in an effort to save their loved ones from perceived threats.<ref name=\"Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse]]''</ref><ref name=\"RotSn\" /> [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]] preyed on [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker's]] love for [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|his wife]] in order to corrupt him. Some Sith even used their love for more power in the Force.<ref name=\"Legacy of the Force: Inferno\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''</ref>\n\n===The ''Sith'ari''===\nIn the original [[Sith (language)|Sith]], the term \"''Sith'ari''\" translated literally into \"lord\" or [[Sith Overlord|\"overlord\"]].<ref name=\"END\">{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/88/indexp2.html|text=''Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties''|int=Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties}}</ref> Over time however, the term became closely associated with the idea of a perfect being, who would rise to power and take control of the Sith Order.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nThe prophesied coming of the ''Sith'ari'' was based around the notion that a perfect being, would epitomize the teachings of the Sith Code and became free of all restrictions. This being would lead the Sith, but also destroy them- a destruction that would make the Sith Order stronger than before.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" /> The identity of the ''Sith'ari'' has been confirmed as [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]],<ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> who destroyed the [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]] in order to remake the Sith through the Rule of Two.<ref name=\"PoD\" /> Nevertheless, during history other Sith Lords also proclaimed themselves as the ''Sith'ari.''<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"Darth Plagueis novel\">[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]</ref> The prophesy of the ''Sith'ari'' is very similar to the Jedi's prophesy in the meaning of an awaited savior, the [[Chosen One/Legends|Chosen One]]&mdash;an extremely powerful Force-sensitive who will bring Balance to the Force.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Guiding codes===\n====The Code of the Sith====\n{{Main|Code of the Sith/Legends}}\n{{Quote|Peace is a lie, there is only passion.<br />Through passion, I gain strength.<br />Through strength, I gain power.<br />Through power, I gain victory.<br />Through victory, my chains are broken.<br />The Force shall free me.|The Sith Code|<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" />}}\nThe code of the Sith was the mantra which stated the core beliefs of the Sith Order and is believed to have been created in contrast to the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]]. The structure of the codes is almost identical, and the initial line of the Sith Code directly contradicts the initial line of the Jedi Code, which reads: ''\"There is no emotion, there is peace.\"''<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nFollowing the embrace of passion, which was believed to be a powerful aspect of nature, the code explains that the strength granted by passion leads to power, which then leads to victory. By way of victory, the Sith believed they could free themselves from the limitations of regular beings, and achieve their potential.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Neophyte Sith believed that the breaking of chains represented the ability to do whatever one wished, however more seasoned members of the Order recognized that the true meaning of freedom was the end of all physical restrictions and the ability to attain perfection. The Sith believed that the only being who could truly live up to the code and attain freedom was the [[Sith'ari/Legends|Sith'ari]], and as such saw it as a guideline by which to live, not a law to abide by.\n\n====The rule of two====\n{{Main|Rule of Two/Legends}}\n{{Quote|Two there should be; no more, no less. One to embody power, the other to crave it.|Darth Bane|<ref name=\"PoD\" />}}\n[[File:BaneZannah-DoE.png|thumb|left|220px|[[Darth Bane/Legends|Bane]] and [[Darth Zannah/Legends|Zannah]], the first Sith to embrace the Rule of Two]]\nThe Rule of Two was the principle upon which the [[Order of the Sith Lords]] was founded. It was created by [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]], a Dark Lord and member of the [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]]. Bane believed that the Sith had weakened themselves by accepting too many into their ranks and that the true dark side had abandoned them. After studying the [[Darth Revan's Sith Holocron|Sith holocron]] of [[Revan/Legends|Darth Revan]], Bane decided that the Brotherhood needed to be destroyed and the Sith rebuilt as a secretive order consisting of two beings&mdash;a single master and a single apprentice.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nBane believed this philosophy would solve the infighting that had long been the bane of the Sith Order. By allowing only two members into the cult at a time, the dark side would remain concentrated within those two beings, instead of legions of ineffective warriors. When the apprentice learned all they could from the master, it was their duty to kill the master and take an apprentice of their own, in order to ensure the continuing strength of the cult. As such, the Rule of Two embraced the idea of the rule of the strong.<ref name=\"PoD\" /> The small number of Sith allowed the Order to remain hidden for a millennium.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\">{{Film|I}}</ref>\n\n====The rule of one====\n{{Main|Rule of One}}\n{{Quote|Wisely, Darth Krayt has undone the mistake of Bane. Therefore no Rule of Two limits the One Sith today.|[[Darth Wyyrlok (I)]]|<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\">''[[Crosscurrent]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:NewSithOrder.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Darth Krayt]]'s vision for the [[One Sith]]]]\nThe Rule of One was the guiding code of the [[One Sith]]. Created by [[Darth Krayt]] after the collapse of the Order of the Sith Lords, it embraced the ideals of the ancient Sith, wherein there was a single [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] who led many lesser Sith Lords, along with other minions and acolytes. The \"One\" represented the Sith Order itself, a unified and cohesive group of Sith who restrained from infighting and were fanatically obedient to Dark Lord Krayt. The practice of one apprentice per master was retained, however there were many masters. Also retained was the practice of slaying a master once an apprentice's training was complete, however this was not done to continue the rule of the strong, but rather to show one's faith and devotion to the Sith cause.\n\nThe Order was considered heretical by Darth Bane, [[Darth Nihilus]], and [[Darth Andeddu]], who voiced their opinions via holocron. Some, including [[Darth Nihl]] and [[Cade Skywalker]] believed that the lack of a line of succession would cause the One Sith to collapse if Darth Krayt were ever killed, though upon Darth Krayt's final death control passed to Darth Nihl and the One Sith continued to follow their [[Darth Nihl|Lord]] loyally.\n\nA [[Rule of One (Palpatine's Doctrine)|similar yet different philosophy]] existed under Sidious's running of the Order. The main difference is that, while it does maintain that only one Sith lord (in this case, Sidious) actually matters, it otherwise superficially held to the Rule of Two.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n{{Quote|Once we were mighty Jedi of the Republic, brothers in the Force.

These Jedi used the Force to bend life to serve their purposes, creating new species, or fearsome, but loyal servants. It was rumored that their ambition went even further: they wanted to defeat death itself. These practices were looked upon with fear and horror by other Jedi, deeming it as abomination to the Force. Feeling their power was threatened, the rogue Jedi sought supporters within the Order, but were turned away. Arguments for their cause turned to conflicts, and these Jedi were exiled from the Order.

One such weapon was the [[Muur Talisman]], which was created by the Sith Lord and former Dark Jedi Karness Muur. Muur was an expert in Sith alchemy and may have helped to create the Leviathan during the Hundred-Year Darkness. His talisman had the power to transform humans into alchemically engineered monsters called [[Rakghoul]]s, whom Muur would be able to command. When he discovered that aliens and Force-sensitives were unaffected, Muur created the [[Rakghoul plague]], which would spread his monsters to those immune to the talisman's power. Eventually, a rival Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa created an [[Dreypa's Oubliette|oubliette]] which would contain Muur, his talisman, and the plague. Muur was killed before he could be captured and his talisman was lost, only to end up on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] several millennia later by unknown means.\n\nEventually, a legendary Sith half-breed named [[Marka Ragnos]] defeated [[Sith Council]] member [[Simus]] in combat and rose to power, claiming the title of Dark Lord of the Sith.<ref name=\"golden3\">[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 3|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith'' 3]]</ref> His little-documented but long reign was known to have been during the \"[[Golden Age of the Sith|Golden Age]]\" of the Sith Empire.

Control of the Empire fell to the Sith Council, which was divided over who should succeed Ragnos as Dark Lord. Two contenders rose to the forefront- [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]] and [[Ludo Kressh]]. Sadow was known as an expansionist in contrast to Kressh's reputation as an isolationist. Originally confined to arguments and debates within the council, the disagreement exploded violently during the [[Funeral of Marka Ragnos]]. The funeral procession was led by Kressh, with Sadow conspicuously missing during the ceremonies. Much to Kressh's chagrin, Sadow made his entrance in the middle of Kressh's eulogy for the fallen Dark Lord. The enraged Kressh demanded Sadow leave, however his rival instead claimed the mantle of Dark Lord. Kressh responded by claiming the title as well, and the two entered into a [[Funeral of Marka Ragnos|duel]] at the foot of [[Tomb of Marka Ragnos|Ragnos's tomb]]. The fierce battle was interrupted by the [[Force ghost/Legends|ghost]] of Marka Ragnos, who implored the two to stop fighting and pick their battles carefully, for the Sith Empire he had helped build was in the balance.<ref name=\"golden2\" />\n\nFollowing Ragnos's departure, the two Sith Lords prepared to reenter combat, however they were once again interrupted, this time by the arrival of wayward hyperspace explorers [[Gav Daragon|Gav]] and [[Jori Daragon]]. The sibling explorers claimed to hail from the Galactic Republic, and were quickly taken into custody<ref name=\"golden2\" /> and imprisoned on the Sith capital world of Ziost. Setting aside their conflict for a time, Kressh and Sadow rejoined the Council, which was debating the fate of the Daragons. Unsurprisingly, the two disagreed on this as well. Kressh, under the belief that they were harbingers of a Republic invasion, called for their immediate execution, while Sadow saw them as a pathway to expansion, by way of conquering their Republic. The council was yet again split between the two, however Ludo Kressh was able to win with the support of the council majority. Simus, a former contender for the title of Dark Lord and ally of Naga Sadow's, went to inform the Daragons of their impending execution. However, Naga Sadow had no intention of following the will of the Council, and killed Simus with weapons confiscated from the Daragon's ship, the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]'', making it appear as though it was a Republic attack. He freed the Daragons and hid them away in his fortress on [[Khar Shian]], while reporting Simus's death back to the Council. Feigning shock, he claimed that the apparent Republic aggression and rescue of the Daragons required retaliation, something he had foreseen. The Council almost unanimously elected him Dark Lord, with the exception of Kressh, who claimed the title for himself and stormed out of the meeting.<ref name=\"golden3\" /> Shortly afterwards, Sadow staged yet another Republic attack by stealing the ''Starbreaker 12'' from impound on Ziost. He would need the ship to return Jori Daragon to the Republic, thereby leading the Dark Lord to his next frontier. The human female was being kept in Sadow's decoy fortress on [[Khar Delba]], while her brother remained on Khar Shian to be trained in the ways of the dark side by Sadow.<ref name=\"golden4\" />\n\n[[File:NagaSadow.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sadow in exile on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]]]\nIn the process Sadow hoped to rid the Empire of Kressh, and so planted evidence on Ziost that would point to back to himself. Kressh acted predictably and [[Battle of Khar Delba|attacked]] Sadow's decoy fortress on Khar Delba.<ref name=\"golden4\" /> Sadow had prepared for the battle and stationed his fleet on the dark side of the moon Khar Shian. He attacked an unsuspecting Kressh, whose commanders were betrayed by their crews. Kressh, knowing he could not win the battle, fled, leaving Naga Sadow as the undisputed ruler of the Sith. During the battle he allowed Jori Daragon to escape with the ''Starbreaker 12'', which was wired with a homing beacon.<ref name=\"golden5\">[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 5|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith'' 5]]</ref> After seemingly killing Kressh,<ref name=\"fall1\">[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 1|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 1]]</ref> Sadow gathered his forces for an invasion of the Republic, initiating a conflict known as the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]]. Sadow even used Sith Lords as generals in his powerful army, including [[Shar Dakhan]]<ref name=\"fall2\">[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 2|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 2]]</ref> and [[Garu]].<ref name=\"JvS\" /> The Republic, unwilling to believe Jori Daragon's story of impending war,<ref name=\"fall1\" /> was unprepared for the onslaught and was initially overwhelmed by the invasion. Sadow's warships and warriors spread throughout Republic space, attacking many worlds simultaneously, while Sadow himself aided by using [[Battle meditation/Legends|battle meditation]] from within his [[Sith Meditation Sphere]]. Stationed above the star [[Primus Goluud/Legends|Primus Goluud]] along with his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], Sadow presented the Republic with a seemingly unbeatable enemy. [[Empress/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta]] of [[Empress Teta/Legends|Koros Major]] was the only Republic official prepared for the assault,<ref name=\"fall3\">[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 3|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 3]]</ref> and her forces beat back Sith attacks on [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]] and [[Kirrek]], and were able to pursue them back to Primus Goluud, where Sadow activated a [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] within his flagship, the [[Corsair (Derriphan-class)|''Corsair'']], that caused the star to supernova. The explosion killed Gav Daragon and forced the Sith to retreat back to their Empire, with Teta's forces in pursuit.<ref name=\"fall4\">[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 4|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 4]]</ref>\n\nReturning to Korriban in defeat, Sadow's forces were met with those of Ludo Kressh. After feigning his demise, Kressh had remained within the Empire, gaining support while Sadow lead the invasion of the Republic. The two fleets clashed, initiating the [[first battle of Korriban]]. When it appeared Kressh would win the battle against Sadow's already wounded forces, the Dark Lord ordered that one of his vessels ram Kressh's flag ship. The impact killed the rival Sith Lord and ended the battle, Sadow's final conflict with Ludo Kressh. Sadow was unable to enjoy his victory however, as Empress Teta's forces emerged from hyperspace moments later, crippling Sadow's ship and decimating his forces. Hoping to escape to [[Yavin Prime/Legends|Yavin Prime]], Sadow fled the battle, and was believed [[Battle at the Denarii Nova|killed]] in the [[Denarii Nova]] he created with the ''Corsair''. As the remains of the Sith Empire crumbled behind him, Sadow and his remaining [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] warriors landed on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], where construction began on the [[Temple of Fire]].<ref name=\"fall5\">[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 5|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 5]]</ref> With the Republic navy entering Sith space, the Sith became desperate. [[Shar Dakhan]] as acting Dark Lord of the Sith ordered his Massassi pilots to ram invading Republic ships. This drove the Republic back for a while, however the Republic's triumph was inevitable. They destroyed most of the Sith Empire.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\n\nHowever, this was not the end of the Empire. Various Sith survivors fled to different parts of the galaxy. Several Sith fled to [[Thule/Legends|Thule]], where they would remain for generations, waiting for their revenge on the Jedi and the Republic. They established a military dictatorship, ruled by an oligarchy of eight generals. Several of the remaining Sith Lords sought refuge on [[Ambria/Legends|Ambria]], where they hid among the planet's dark side energies in order to avoid persecution. They stayed on the planet for many years, until passing into the Force themselves, leaving yet more dark side spirits on Ambria. On [[Kesh/Legends|Kesh]], the descendants of a crashed ship the ''[[Omen]]'' survived and formed the [[Lost Tribe of Sith]]. Several Sith sects survived on [[Vjun/Legends|Vjun]] and passed on their teachings secretly through the families. On [[Tund/Legends|Tund]], the Sith refugees eventually became mere charlatans known as the [[Sorcerers of Tund/Legends|Sorcerers of Tund]]. As a result of an unstable hyperdrive, the Sith starship [[Harbinger (Sith dreadnaught)|Harbinger]] traveled to the future to the year [[41 ABY]]. Finally, one [[Tenebrae|Sith Lord]] took his forces and retreated to the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] where they would bide their time, and wait. This [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|hidden Sith Empire]] still held on to Malachor V as a teaching center. Sadow was unable to rebuild the Empire after the war as he had hoped to do on Yavin, and so placed himself in suspended animation within one of his temples.\n\n===The rise of Freedon Nadd and conflict on Onderon===\n{{Quote|Jedi must be willing to look into their own hearts and spirits. If you do not&hellip;well, let us just say that you will never become a true Jedi.|Jedi Master Matta Tremayne to Freedon Nadd|<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\">''[[Tales of the Jedi Companion]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:NaddAssBaddAss.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Freedon Nadd]] lingered for centuries after his death as a [[Force ghost/Legends|Force ghost]].]]\nWhile Naga Sadow remained in stasis, the Sith Order survived in obscurity on Yavin 4 and the Jedi and Republic once again believed their enemy defeated. Around six-hundred years following the fall of the Sith Empire, a young human began training at [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr's]] [[Great Jedi Library/Legends|Great Jedi Library]] on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]. The young Jedi named [[Freedon Nadd]] impressed his masters with his connection to the Force and eagerness to find harmony. The attention from his masters caused arrogance in Nadd that lead him to believe he would soon be elevated to knighthood. To his surprise, he was passed over for knighthood, causing him to become resentful and conflicted. Nadd sought out [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Matta Tremayne]] in the hopes that she might be able to show him what he must do in order to become a Knight. In a test for the young Jedi's humility, Tremayne ignored him until his anger burst out and he turned to leave. Only then did she acknowledge him, challenging him to a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] duel. The two engaged one another, and Freedon's anger rose. Sensing this, Tremayne deactivated her lightsaber, exposing herself to attack from Nadd. Unable to stop himself, Freedon's saber cut through Tremayne, killing her. Initially regretful, Nadd soon became infuriated as he began to believe it was all a ploy to get him removed from the Order. Abandoning the Jedi, he fled Ossus craving revenge.\n\nNadd first traveled to the heart of the now defunct Sith Empire in the hopes that the dark side teachings there would lead him to the revenge he desired. He arrived on the world of [[Ashas Ree/Legends|Ashas Ree]], where the ancient Sith Lord [[Garu]] had hidden the [[Holocron of King Adas]]. Learning from the holocron, Nadd studied deeper into the dark side and traveled deeper into old [[Sith Worlds|Sith Space]]. Eventually the he came upon the fourth moon of Yavin and the sleeping Dark Lord Naga Sadow. Sadow, finally recognizing Nadd as one who could restore the power of the Sith, awakened and consented to train the fallen Jedi in the ways of the Sith. The training lasted for a time, however before it was complete, Nadd's confidence in his own abilities once again took control. Believing himself strong enough for the title of Dark Lord, Nadd slew Sadow and seized the mantle. Sadow's death marked the end of the Sith species, as the remaining Massassi on Yavin had become primitive mutations of themselves following centuries of experimentation at the hands of Sadow.\n\n[[File:OmminAttack-TOTJFNU2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]], King of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] and descendant of Freedon Nadd]]\nAfter gathering what relics he could from the Massassi Temples, Nadd left Yavin 4 behind and traveled to [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], an [[Inner Rim/Legends|Inner Rim]] world. Onderon was a densely forested planet home to large beasts and a single, heavily guarded city, [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]]. The city was surrounded by walls and [[Iziz defense tower|defense towers]] used to keep out the beasts of the jungle, which the people of Iziz had fought for centuries. Nadd arrived on the planet and wowed the populace with his dark side magic and [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]]. Much like the exiled dark Jedi millennia before on Korriban, Nadd proclaimed himself the ruler of the people in Iziz and King of Onderon. Iziz's law and order was based on the policy of banishing dissidents and \"criminals\" from the walled city, condemning them to death by the animals of Onderon. Eventually, the banished criminals organized themselves into the \"[[Beast Riders]]\" after taming the beasts of the jungle, such as the [[Drexl]], [[Cannok]], and [[Boma]]. The Riders continually attacked the city they had once called home in a centuries-long conflict known as the [[Beast Wars]]. Nadd was able to elevate himself to a near-God status with the people by repelling attacks by the Riders by use of the Force. Although his reign was oppressive, the Onderonians accepted his teachings and embraced his dark side influence. Nadd eventually died and was buried beneath the Iziz palace in [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|his tomb]]. His bloodline continued to rule Onderon, and although he was dead, Iziz was still saturated with the dark side presence of Freedon Nadd.\n\n====The Onderonian Monarchy====\n{{Quote|You should know the darkness has been with us for centuries. My father, his father&hellip;|King Ommin, speaking of his dark side heritage|audio=OmminCenturies.flac|<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi (audio)\">[[Tales of the Jedi (audio drama)|''Tales of the Jedi'' audio drama]]</ref>}}\nHis descendants would continue his oppressive rule as the [[King/Legends|kings]] and queens of Onderon, and call upon his lingering spirit for power and dark side teachings. His tomb beneath Iziz became a strong [[Vergence/Legends|nexus of dark side power]] and his collections of artifacts became treasures to those seeking his dark side strength. Eventually the Dark Lord's descendant [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]] took the throne and trained extensively with Freedon Nadd's [[Force ghost/Legends|spirit]]. The two also seduced [[Amanoa]] into marrying the King and training in the Sith arts. Nadd played the two against one another hoping the competition would reveal the stronger of the two, and thereby the one worthy of becoming the vessel of his resurrection. Although Ommin became extremely capable in the dark side, his power in the Force caused him to lose control over his own body, and the King became confined to a [[Ommin's mechanical exoskeleton|mechanical exoskeleton]] that also served as a life-support system.\n[[File:Amanoadarkness.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Amanoa]] surrenders completely to Freedon Nadd's power.]]\nUnfit for the public eye, he handed control of Iziz to his wife, [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] Amanoa, who abandoned her studies with Nadd to focus on the affairs of state. While the people of Onderon believed Ommin dead, he hid beneath Iziz in his lair, continuing his dark side study, collecting Sith artifacts, and gathering an cult of followers calling themselves [[Naddist]]s. Ommin and his wife were both too embroiled with their own interests to take direct command of the cult, and so their proxies, [[Warb Null]] and [[Novar (Human)|Novar]], acted in their stead. The armor-clad Warb Null was a young Force-sensitive who had been seduced to the dark side by a Sith spirit, while Novar had been an apprentice to Ommin and Amanoa following his tenure as Ommin's personal aide.\n\nEventually, Freedon Nadd came to realize that neither the King nor the Queen would be fit to serve as the agent of his resurrection. Ommin had become far too weak under the pall of the dark side and Amanoa was no longer focused on the Sith. Unwilling to surrender, Nadd attempted one last time to pull the Queen back into the grip of the Sith, appearing before her and warning her not to allow the still ongoing Beast Wars to fully erupt, as it would result in her destruction. Although Nadd hoped this would scare the Queen back into her dark side studies, Amanoa took an entirely different direction and requested the aide of the Jedi Order to end the centuries-long conflict. The Jedi agreed and sent [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] [[Arca Jeth]]'s apprentices to Iziz to begin negotiations. Hiding the taint of the dark side from the young Jedi [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], [[Cay Qel-Droma]], and [[Tott Doneeta]], Amanoa requested their assistance in defeating the Beast Riders, who kidnapped her and Ommin's daughter, [[Galia]], shortly after the Jedi arrival. Soon, Amanoa learned that her daughter consented to be married to the leader of the Beast Riders, Oron Kira, and hoped to settle the war peacefully. Having no interest in a peaceful settlement, the enraged Queen revealed her dark side allegiance to her enemies, surrounding Iziz in a [[Waves of darkness|palpable darkness]]. During the ensuing battle, the Naddist army fought to defend the Queen as she retreated to Freedon Nadd's tomb beneath the palace. The Naddists fought valiantly against the Beast Riders for a time under Amanoa's dark side influence, however the arrival of Master [[Arca Jeth]] broke their advantage. Jeth was able to follow the Queen into the Dark Lord's tomb and dispel his dark energy, killing Queen Amanoa in the process.\n\n[[File:NaddGuides-TOTJFNU2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Freedon Nadd's spirit guides [[Aleema Keto|Aleema]] and [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal Keto]] to safety.]]\nThe death of the Queen and the supposed dispersion of Nadd's dark energy did little to pull Onderon out of darkness however. Even after Galia took the throne and the fighting ended, there was still a noticeable dark side aura throughout Iziz. The decision was made by the Jedi to exhume the remains of Freedon Nadd and bury both him and Queen Amanoa on Onderon's jungle moon of [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], where their presence could no longer corrupt future rulers. News of his wife's death at the hands of the Jedi and the end of the Beast Wars eventually reached King Ommin, still hiding beneath Iziz. Prepared to reveal himself once more, the frail king had the dark side slave, Warb Null, lead the Naddist cult into battle on the streets of Iziz during the Queen's funeral procession. The dark-siders tunneled up into the surface of the city and ambushed the Jedi. Null fought them off and the Naddists captured the sarcophagi of both deceased monarchs, quickly returning them to Ommin's underground sanctuary. Shortly after the battle, Ommin, empowered by the spirit of Freedon Nadd, distracted Arca Jeth long enough for the King to seize the Jedi Master and flee with him deep into the tunnels. Jeth's Padawan, Ulic Qel-Droma, was unable to save his master from abduction, as he had entered a duel with Warb Null. The duel ended quickly however, with Null dead.\n\nMeanwhile, on Koros Major, [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal]] and [[Aleema Keto]], cousins and royal heirs of the [[Tetan monarchy/Legends|Tetan Monarchy]], had formed the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] secret society with their friends. The group researched the Sith and their ancient Empire which instigated the Great Hyperspace war centuries before, and became so consumed with the history that the two decided to take a trip to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], where the [[Galactic Museum/Legends|Galactic Museum]] had prepared an exhibit featuring artifacts from the Sith Empire. At the behest of Aleema, Satal stole a [[Sith spellbook/Legends|Sith spellbook]] from the exhibit, ''[[The Dark Lords of the Sith]]'', however neither of the two could read the contents, as it was written in ancient Sith glyphs. As the fighting continued on Onderon for days, word of the conflict spread across the galaxy via the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]]. A report of the Sith-worshipping dark side army was read on a newscast, which caught the attention of the cousins. The two resolved to travel to Onderon in search of an individual who could translate the text for them.\n\n[[File:FreedonNaddTempleInterior.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The final resting place of Freedon Nadd on Dxun]]\nAlthough the battle on Onderon was progressing well for the Naddists, the Jedi soon received reinforcements in the form of a Republic battle group and five additional Jedi from Ossus. One of these Jedi, [[Nomi Sunrider]], was able to turn the tide with her [[Battle meditation/Legends|battle meditation]] ability. The fighting, which had been confined to the jungle stronghold of the Beast Riders for two days, now returned to Iziz. As the streets once again became embroiled in war, the Keto cousins dropped out of hyperspace, right in the middle of the war zone. Ignoring warnings from the Republic fleet in orbit, the two descended towards the city and were shot down by crossfire. Aleema and Satal survived the crash and were able to contact King Ommin. He gifted the aspiring darksiders with a [[Sith talisman/Legends|Sith amulet]] which granted them the power to read the Sith spellbook. In return, he asked for the opportunity to transcribe the spellbook for his own collection. As the trio completed their deal, Ommin introduced the Ketos to his latest addition to his collection: Arca Jeth. Ommin planned to torture the Jedi Master enough that he would be unable to resist the temptation of the dark side. However, it was at this moment that the Jedi task force in the city was able to penetrate Ommin's stronghold and ambush his defenders. As Satal and Aleema panicked and fled deeper into the tunnels beneath Iziz, the King fought the Jedi, but to no avail. Ulic Qel-Droma was able to slice through Ommin's exoskeleton, incapacitating him. The King begged for the assistance of Freedon Nadd, however the Dark Lord had decided that the Keto's showed more promise than Ommin. Nadd's spirit guided the two Krath founders to safety and returned to tell Ommin that he had forsaken him, and the Jedi that their victory would be short-lived. Before departing Iziz, Nadd prophesized on the fate of Ulic Qel-Droma, claiming he was destined to become one of the great Sith Lords.\n\nWith Ommin's death, and the end of the [[Freedon Nadd Uprising]], Onderon was finally free of Nadd's dark shadow. The bodies of King Ommin, Queen Amanoa, and Freedon Nadd were all moved to Dxun, into a [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|tomb]] of [[Beskar/Legends|Mandalorian iron]], not to be disturbed again. Aleema and Satal, armed with new knowledge and artifacts from Iziz, returned to Empress Teta to plan their ascension.\n\n===The Great Sith War===\n{{Quote|Let it be so, Qel-Droma&hellip; The ancient Sith have spoken.

However, a new opportunity would present itself in the form of the rising [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] cult in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]] and the young Jedi [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]].\n\nExar Kun was the pupil of [[Krevaaki]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vodo-Siosk Baas]] along with the [[Cathar/Legends|Cathar]] Jedi [[Crado]] and [[Sylvar]]. Kun was extremely talented in the Force and, much like Freedon Nadd centuries earlier, developed an arrogance that led him to believe he was worthy of receiving special teachings. Becoming engrossed with the idea that he could research Sith teachings and powers, yet remain uncorrupted by the dark side, Kun began to delve into forbidden Sith holocrons on the Jedi world of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. During a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] training session with his master and fellow students, Kun defeated Crado easily. Following Crado's defeat, Master Baas instructed Sylvar to enter a duel with Kun. Exar taunted Sylvar with claims that nonhumans were inept and unworthy, angering her, and in retribution, she struck the human with her claws, scarring and infuriating him. Kun attacked her viciously and nearly killed her when Vodo-Siosk Baas stepped in and stopped Kun's saber with his walking staff. In an attempt to teach Exar Kun a lesson in strength, Baas challenged his wayward apprentice to a duel and gained the upper hand quickly, despite the immense odds of walking stick versus lightsaber. Kun was able to defeat his master with aid from Crado, who threw Exar his lightsaber during the duel. Victorious, Kun declared himself a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] and departed Dantooine to search for the secrets of the Sith.\n\n[[File:Krathcoup.jpg|thumb|left|205px|Satal and Aleema's [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] forces overwhelm the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]] during their [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|coup]].]]\nKun followed his curiosity to Onderon, where the fighting had just ended. He learned here that the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd had recently been interred on Dxun, and traveled to the moon in search of answers. Kun broke into the sealed tomb and encountered the spirit of Nadd, who encouraged the young man to continue his search on the ancient Sith burial world of Korriban. As Kun left Dxun for old Sith space, Aleema and Satal Keto, who had also recently paid Onderon a visit, were setting [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|their plan]] for domination in motion on Koros Major.\n\nThe two Krath founders, after having used the late King Ommin's artifacts and the spirit of Freedon Nadd to become adept in Sith sorcery, traveled to the [[Tetan carbonite smelter]] above Koros where [[Keto|Lord Keto]] and [[Magda Keto|Lady Magda Keto]], rulers of the Empress Teta system and parents of Satal and Aleema, were being given a tour. The two were escorted by the royal tutor [[Korus]], whose tongue was transformed into an [[Adegan eel]] by the children. This bewildered Lord Keto, who attempted to call for help, but his guard's swords were transformed into snakes that began to attack their wielders. Helpless, Lord and Lady Keto accepted defeat at the hands of their children and continued their tour, now guiding the new Emperor Satal and Empress Aleema of the Teta system. The group entered a smelting chamber, and the new rulers of Teta had the former rulers tied above vats of molten carbonite and lowered into them. With Lord and Lady Keto dead and the Tetan government under their control, Satal and Aleema took up residence in the [[Iron Citadel/Legends|Iron Citadel]] in [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]]. The worlds of Empress Teta quickly fell in line behind the Krath, all except for Koros Major itself. Initiating the [[Krath Holy Crusade]], the Ketos launched an assault against their own capital world, hoping to bring it in line.\n\n====The Krath Holy Crusade====\n{{Quote|I'll bet they don't even understand what they've unleashed, and that makes them all the more dangerous.|[[Cay Qel-Droma]]|<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 1\">[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 1|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith'' 1]]</ref>}}\n[[File:BattleOfKorosMajor-NEC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aleema Keto]]'s illusions attack the [[Republic Navy/Legends|Republic Navy]] at the [[Battle of Koros Major]].]]\nAs the Ketos prepared to crush the resistance on Koros Major, word of the struggle and Krath usurpation reached the Republic capital of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. Jedi Master Arca Jeth petitioned the Republic leadership to send aid to the resistance fighters and help defeat the Krath, as the dark side cult reminded the Jedi too much of the Naddists recently defeated on Onderon. The Republic complied, and a battle group to relieve the resistance fighters was organized, lead by Jedi Knights [[Nomi Sunrider]] and Ulic Qel-Droma. However, when the Republic fleet arrived at Koros Major, the battle was already in progress, with Krath warships attacking the planet. As Qel-Droma ordered his ships into battle positions, Aleema and Satal began their counter-attack. Aleema utilized [[Sith sorcery/Legends|Sith magic]] to conjure illusions of [[space grazer]]s which headed directly at the Republic fleet, causing the officers to panic and their ships to scatter. Nomi Sunrider was able to see through the illusion and refocus the fleet, however the Krath decided that the battle would require both the Force and physical military might, and so ordered wings of [[CX-133 Chaos fighter|Chaos fighters]] to initiate suicide runs on the Republic vessels. As the fighters closed the distance between the fleets, Aleema conjured an illusion of additional wings of Chaos fighters to confuse and overwhelm the Republic ships. Sunrider again saw through the illusion and was able to block Aleema's ghost ships from interfering in the battle, but there were still many real fighters that collided with Republic vessels. The Republic fleet was crippled and forced to retreat with a severely injured Qel-Droma, while the Krath were left to complete their conquest of Koros. The [[Battle of Koros Major|Battle of Empress Teta]] was a complete success for the Krath, and marked the beginning of the wider [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]].<br />\n[[File:KrathWarDroid-TotJDLotS3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A [[Krath war droid/Legends|Krath war droid]] on [[Deneba/Legends|Deneba]]]]\nBecause of the massive losses over Koros Major, the Jedi leadership decided it was time for an assembly to be called in order to discuss the Krath threat and other gathering shadows. Krath intelligence agents discovered that the [[Conclave at Deneba|grand convocation]] was to be held on [[Deneba/Legends|Deneba]], and Satal planned for a direct assault against the Jedi there. As thousands of Jedi vessels descended upon Deneba, Satal was able to sneak a Krath warship among them, hiding in orbit. Meanwhile, [[Light-year/Legends|light-years]] away on Korriban, Exar Kun was exploring the planet once inhabited by the Dark Lords of the Sith. Guided by Freedon Nadd's spirit, Kun became trapped and injured beneath rubble during a cave-in within an ancient tomb. The cave-in was designed by Nadd as a test for Kun, who would need to touch the dark side in order to survive. Initially fearful, Kun reached out through the Force for his former Master Baas on Deneba, who attempted to help his pupil. Freedon Nadd refused to allow this to happen however, and blocked Vodo's attempts at aiding Kun. Near death and running out of options, Kun embraced the dark side and freed himself. Kun's anger and malice healed his broken body and sent ripples through the Force that greatly disturbed the Jedi assembly, however Baas accepted that he could no longer help the young man. Kun, still under the belief he could use both the dark and light side without consequence, left Korriban on a course for Yavin 4, where Nadd claimed his training would be completed.\n\nOn Deneba the Jedi debated over how to best combat the dark side and it's followers, and after hearing proposals and arguments from Ulic Qel-Droma and others, the convocation took a short recess. Just before the conclave could resume, Satal set his plan in motion. The Krath warship in orbit above the planet launched a large number of escape pods, each filled with [[Krath war droid/Legends|Krath war droids]]. Catching the Jedi unaware, the droids were able to kill many of them in the initial stages of the attack. In conjunction with the war droid assault, the [[Service droid/Legends|service droids]] who had been serving the Jedi during the convocation also attacked their masters, having been sabotaged by Krath spies prior to the arrival of the Jedi. Although all the droids were destroyed at the [[Battle of Deneba]], many Jedi were killed, including Arca Jeth. The death of his master caused Ulic Qel-Droma to plan a mission to destroy the Krath from within, a strategy frowned upon by many other Jedi, including his late master.\n\nUlic traveled to the Empress Teta system and cut off contact with the rest of the Order. He was quickly able to convince Aleema that he had fallen from the Jedi way and become sympathetic to the Krath, however Satal was not so trusting. He had the young Jedi imprisoned and tortured which caused Ulic to begin a journey towards the dark side. Satal eventually came to trust Ulic, and Qel-Droma was instated as a warlord of the Krath. Fearing the worst after months with no contact, Ulic's lover Nomi Sunrider planned a mission to rescue Ulic from [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]]. Whe she arrived however, she found that Ulic still wished to maintain his cover and did nothing as Nomi was sentenced to death. He attempted to explain himself to her via a secret message that was intercepted by Satal. Not knowing Ulic's plan, Nomi escaped her prison but before she could depart, she was confronted by Satal, who was then confronted by Ulic Qel-Droma. Ulic had recently learned from Aleema that it was Satal who ordered the attack on Deneba, and in search of revenge for the late Arca Jeth, Ulic attacked Satal. During the ensuing struggle, Ulic killed Satal in a fit of anger and succumbed to the dark side, Keto's intent from the start. Although Nomi and other Jedi attempted to help him, he attacked them as well and drove them off while he stayed on Koros Major. Ulic soon took Satal's place at Aleema's side was awarded with a rare Sith amulet while Nomi began to plan yet another mission to rescue Ulic.\n[[File:UlicVsSatal1.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''\"Some crimes deserve the justice of hatred!\"'': Ulic Qel-Droma exacts revenge on Satal Keto.]]\n\nAcross the galaxy, Exar Kun was also continuing his descent into darkness. Much like Ulic, who believed he could conquer the dark side from within yet still remain true to the light, Exar believed he could use the power of the dark yet remain uncorrupted by it. Freedon Nadd, whose spirit still guided Kun, was intent on proving him wrong. As Kun arrived on Yavin 4, he was confronted by the primitive and savage Massassi people who easily captured the Dark Jedi, as Exar was still unwilling to fully give into the power of the dark side. On the verge of death, Kun was again visited by Freedon Nadd. Nadd once again told him that the only way to survive was to embrace the dark side and Exar complied, seizing a Sith amulet from a [[Zythmnr|Massassi priest]] and using its power to free himself and kill his captors. Exar had fully accepted the Sith ways, much to Freedon Nadd's delight, who immediately demanded that Kun get to work on the creation of a new body for the long-dead Dark Lord to inhabit, a task both Ommin and Amanoa had failed on Onderon. Exar had grown annoyed with Nadd however, and used his newfound power to destroy his spirit once and for all. In his last moments, Nadd visited Ulic Qel-Droma and Aleema Keto in Cinnagar and warned them of Kun's rising power. Freedon Nadd, plague of the Jedi and father to the Naddists and Krath, was gone. Exar Kun, free from Nadd's command, went about enslaving the remaining Massassi on Yavin 4 and searching for threats to his power. He identified two darksiders on Koros Major, Ulic and Aleema, and set out to kill them.\n\nKun arrived in Cinnagar directly after a [[Battle of Empress Teta|Jedi assault]] lead by Nomi Sunrider was beaten back by Qel-Droma. Exar [[Duel in the Iron Citadel (Exar Kun)|confronted]] Ulic and Aleema and quickly incapacitated the Tetan Empress. Qel-Droma was much more of a challenge however, and the two dark Jedi dueled fiercely. The duel was short-lived though, as Exar and Ulic's Sith amulets began to glow with dark energy, enticing the spirit of Marka Ragnos to appear as it had during the duel between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh. This time however, the combatants yielded to the spirit and stopped their duel to heed Ragnos's words. The ancient Sith Lord proclaimed that Exar Kun was to be the new Dark Lord of the Sith, while Ulic Qel-Doma was to become his apprentice. The two were branded with Sith tattoos on their foreheads to signify their new allegiance. With the inception of the new Sith Lords, the order was once again revived, the first time since the death of Freedon Nadd centuries before.\n\n====The Brotherhood of the Sith====\n{{Quote|You are puppets of a tradition pretending to be important.

Using the [[Dark Reaper]],they inflicted near-genocidal casualties on worlds such as [[Raxus Prime/Legends|Raxus Prime]]. Exar used [[Sith alchemy/Legends|Sith alchemy]] to create [[Terentatek/Legends|Terentateks]], large creatures with a thirst for Jedi blood. Ulic was also able to make an alliance with [[Mandalore the Indomitable]] on [[Kuar/Legends|Kuar]], and with the new addition of [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] soldiers to their forces, the Sith overwhelmed the Republic defenders at [[Foerost/Legends|Foerost]]. While the Krath and Mandalorian armies under Ulic's command terrorized the galaxy, Exar went about building a following of darksiders for the Sith Lords to command. He traveled to Ossus, where he gave an impassioned speech to the Jedi students there, claiming their masters were withholding knowledge and power from them. Many students, including Crado, left Ossus for Yavin 4, where they would become the apprentices of Kun, however before Kun himself left, he planned on retrieving the Sith holocron possessed by [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]], the ancient Jedi hero of the Great Hyperspace War. Kun confronted Odan-Urr and killed him, taking the holocron for himself and claiming the ancient Master declared Exar a Jedi Master directly before his death.\n\nOn Yavin 4, his students expressed doubt about the path they had started on after sensing the dark taint of the moon. In response, Kun destroyed Odan-Urr's Sith holocron, releasing the spirits trapped inside which then possessed the doubtful Jedi. Reassured by the dark spirits now controlling their actions, the Jedi students trained with Kun in the dark arts and were eventually convinced by him that the last thing standing in the way of another Sith Golden Age was their former Jedi Masters. The students left Yavin to hunt down and kill their masters in an incredibly successful strike known as the [[Sith uprising]]. Meanwhile, Ulic had grown ambitious and arrogant with his new Mandalorian army and decided to strike the heart of the Republic, Coruscant. Although the plan was frowned upon by Kun, Ulic went ahead with the [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Sith War)|attack]] and lead Mandalore and Aleema into battle alongside their armies. Aleema, tired of sharing power over the Krath with Ulic, ordered a retreat while Qel-Droma was attacking the Republic war room alone. Abandoned, Ulic was eventually defeated by the Jedi on Coruscant and put on [[Trial of Ulic Qel-Droma|trial]].\n\n[[File:TotJTSW3-Textless-EC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Exar Kun shortly before killing his former master, [[Vodo-Siosk Baas]]]]\nUlic's trial was presided over by the Republic [[Sidrona|Supreme Chancellor]] and he was found guilty on all charges. As he was sentenced to death, Exar Kun strode into the Senate Hall where the trial was being held. Immobilizing the senators and executing the [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]], Kun freed his apprentice only to be confronted by his former master, Vodo-Siosk Baas. Kun used his new weapon, a [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|double-bladed lightsaber]] to overpower and murder Baas, who claimed he would one day return to defeat his apprentice. Kun and Qel-Droma departed Coruscant to continue their war after again proclaiming the dominance of the Sith. Upon Ulic's return to command, Mandalore informed him of Aleema's treachery at the Battle of Coruscant and the Sith apprentice began planning for revenge.\n\nThe next stage of the war centered around the [[Battle of Kemplex Nine|attack]] on [[Kemplex Nine]]. Ulic hoped to use the battle as a trap for Aleema, while Exar planned to trick the Krath Sorceress into destroying the [[Cron Cluster/Legends|Cron Cluster]], a group of ten closely packed stars, which would result in the destruction of a different target. Exar armed Aleema with the [[Corsair (Derriphan-class)|''Corsair'']], the ancient flagship of Naga Sadow discovered on Yavin 4. Kun taught her how to use it's Sith magic to rip the cores from stars, but neglected to tell her that it would cause a supernova the ship could not protect her from. Aleema and Crado were to take the ship and lead the assault on Kemplex Nine, however Aleema was overly eager to use her new weapon. After destroying the Republic jump-station that was their target, Aleema lured a Jedi fleet into the nearby Cron Cluster, just as Exar Kun had predicted. Aleema ripped the core out of one of the stars, incinerating the Jedi fleet, however she was unable to control the explosion. A chain reaction began, with all ten stars going nova and destroying the ''Corsair'' along with Aleema and Crado. Also according to Exar Kun's plan, the supernova headed directly at Ossus, the primary target of the Sith.\n[[File:CayVsUlic-TheSithWar5.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Sith Lord Ulic Qel-Droma battles and eventually kills his Jedi brother, Cay Qel-Droma, on Ossus.]]\nWhile the Jedi attempted to evacuate Ossus with as many relics and artifacts as they could, Exar Kun and Ulic lead an [[Battle of Ossus (Great Sith War)|attack]] against the planet. Kun's Massassi warriors looted what remained of the Jedi library while the Dark Lord himself attempted to steal a cache of ancient lightsabers from the [[Neti/Legends|Neti]] Jedi Master [[Ood Bnar]]. Kun failed as Bnar transformed into a giant tree and hid the lightsabers beneath his body, not to be disturbed again until [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|millennia later]]. Ulic flew above the fray during the battle, only to be confronted by his brother, [[Cay Qel-Droma]], who had sensed his presence. Ulic and Cay landed and began a duel which ended with Ulic killing the brother he had once fought alongside as a Jedi. Witnessing the murder, Nomi Sunrider trapped Ulic in a \"wall of light\" and [[Sever Force/Legends|cut him off from the Force]] out of disgust for what he had become. Ulic only now realized what he had done and renounced his Sith ties, agreeing to help the Jedi defeat the Dark Lord Exar Kun. After both the Jedi and Sith retreated from the planet, Ossus was hit by the [[Cron Supernova/Legends|Cron Supernova]], destroying all life on the planet, save for Master Bnar.\n\nOn other battlefields across the galaxy, the war still raged. Following the Jedi victory at the [[Battle of Toprawa (Great Sith War)|Battle of Toprawa]], the failed Jedi apprentice [[Haazen]] was nearly killed by explosions in caverns that claimed the life of many of his fellow Jedi, including [[Barrison Draay]]. Haazen was revived by the Sith and turned to the dark side, only to hide his allegiances following the end of the war. On Onderon, the remaining Mandalorian warriors were beaten back and retreated to Dxun, where Mandalore the Indomitable was killed by wild animals. With Ulic's help, the Jedi also prepared for a massive assault on Kun's fortress on Yavin 4. The war was drawing to a close, and Exar Kun was the last leader of the Sith still standing.\nAbove Yavin, thousands of Jedi ships descended towards Kun's fortress. Realizing the war was lost, Kun assembled his Massassi warriors at the temples left behind by Naga Sadow. Exar Kun called upon Sith magic and drained his Massassi slaves of their life force, killing them. The energy he gained from them allowed the Dark Lord to break free of his mortal body and maintain his spirit, which hoped to leave Yavin to continue the war elsewhere in the galaxy. Sensing this, Nomi and rest of the assembled Jedi created a wall of light around Yavin 4, hoping it would have the same effect as it did against Ulic on Ossus. The massive surge of light side energy managed to keep Exar Kun's spirit trapped on the planet, tied to [[Temple of Exar Kun|one of his temples]], however the collision of light energy from the Jedi and dark from Kun's Sith magic caused a massive firestorm to erupt and rage across the moon, killing all life on its surface. The Jedi retreated, their mission accomplished. The Great Sith War was over, and the Sith Order was defeated.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Great Sith War, the remains of the Brotherhood of the Sith were disbanded. The Empress Teta system was finally liberated from the remnants of the Krath at the [[recapture of the Empress Teta system]] and the Jedi and Republic began the long process of rebuilding a broken galaxy. During this period, the Jedi initiated the [[Great Hunt (Jedi)|Great Hunt]], which was an effort to kill Exar Kun's remaining Tarentateks that terrorized the Order during the war. The program was mostly successful, however several beasts survived on both Korriban and [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. The Jedi also attempted to [[Cleansing of the Nine Houses|destroy]] the Sith-inspired [[Mecrosa Order]], however their attempts were unsuccessful. The few surviving members of the Brotherhood were still scattered throughout the galaxy. [[Toki Tollivar]] became a serial killer on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], Haazen infiltrated the [[Jedi Covenant]], an organization designed to ensure the extinction of the Sith, and Ulic Qel-Droma was killed shortly after his redemption on [[Rhen Var/Legends|Rhen Var]]. The Old Sith Empire continued to survive in obscurity in the unknown regions, still lead by the same Sith Lord who had escaped the Empire's destruction centuries before during the Great Hyperspace War.\n\n===Surviving influences===\n{{Quote|The Sith came to us with an offer&ndash;to fight a worthy enemy in a battle that would be remembered forever.|[[Canderous Ordo]]|<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" />}}\n[[File:SWKOTOR33.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Haazen]], [[Sith acolyte/Legends|Sith Acolyte]] in hiding]]\nThe remnants of the ancient Sith Empire saw an opportunity for revenge in the form of the Mandalorians. After [[Mandalore the Indomitable]]'s death on Dxun during the war, [[Mandalore the Ultimate]] rose to take his place as leader of the Mandalorian clans. This new Mandalore reformed his warriors into the [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Neo-Crusaders]] and made a base on the moon of Dxun. According to [[Canderous Ordo]], Mandalore was approached by the Sith and goaded into attacking the Republic, as it was weak and still rebuilding in the aftermath of the Great Sith War. Mandalore accepted and readied his armies for war, and in [[3976 BBY]], twenty years after the conclusion of the Great Sith War, the Mandalorians began a brutal campaign for dominance over the Outer Rim and areas of Unknown Regions. The Neo-Crusaders were able to carve out an area of space for themselves that exceeded that of the [[Hutt Empire]], however the Republic refused to respond to the threat until the Mandalorians neared the business world of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], at which point the Galactic Senate pledged it's support to the defense of Taris- a defense lead by [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]]. A military-security cordon was established and the battle entered into an uneasy period of tension. While the Republic leapt headlong into the conflict, the Jedi remained cautious. The High Council decided it would not aid the Republic, turning the sentiment of much of the Republic Army against them.\n[[File:YoungKarny.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Karness Muur]] and [[Muur Talisman|his talisman]]]]\nDuring this period, the Jedi Covenant's [[First WatchCircle]], a group of [[Jedi Consular]]s based on Taris, received a [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]] depicting the return of the Sith. The Jedi Covenant's purpose was to prevent this specific event from happening, thereby avoiding yet another Great Sith War. In response, these Jedi Consulars [[Padawan Massacre|massacred their students]], who they believed to be the source of the future Sith menace. [[Zayne Carrick]], Padawan to [[Lucien Draay]], was the only one of the five students to survive. The First WatchCircle and the Jedi Covenant framed Carrick for the massacre, claiming he had turned to the dark side. In reality, all of these events were being engineered by Haazen, the Sith acolyte still in hiding within the Jedi Covenant since the conclusion of the war. Haazen had been Draay's Jedi Master, and since his grievous injuries and turn to the dark side during the war, he had been plotting to destroy the Jedi Order from within by wresting control of the Covenant away from Lucien's mother, [[Krynda Draay]].\n\nAs the Jedi hunted for Carrick, he and [[Covenant Shadow]] [[Celeste Morne]] encountered the [[Muur Talisman]] on Taris. The ancient relic of the original Sith Empire had somehow made its way to the city-planet, where the Rakghoul Plague that had been created by [[Karness Muur]] several millennia before ran rampant. Shortly after the two Jedi discovered it, the Talisman was taken to [[Jebble]] by invading Mandalorian forces. There, it transformed an entire Mandalorian army into Rakghouls that threatened to leave the planet and spread the disease throughout the galaxy. Morne and Carrick also discovered that the Talisman still contained the spirit of Karness Muur himself, who hoped to possess a Force-sensitive body and create a new Sith era enforced by his Rakghouls. Celeste Morne, who had dedicated her life to the prevention of the return of the Sith, allowed the Talisman to attach itself to her. She was able to control Muur to some degree, however she was corrupted as well, and was in danger of slipping to the dark side. Carrick and Morne discovered another Sith artifact on Jebble that had been acquired by the Mandalorians&mdash;[[Dreypa's Oubliette]]. The oubliette was designed to contain both Muur and the plague, but Morne would have to be interred within it as well. Carrick planned to leave and return with help for her, but, shortly after his departure, the Mandalorian fleet arrived and bombarded the planet with nuclear warheads, killing the Rakghouls and flooding the once-frozen world. Carrick believed Morne to be dead; however, she was safely in stasis within the intact oubliette, and would remain there for almost four millennia.\n\nZayne Carrick traveled to Coruscant shortly after, hoping to force a member of the First WatchCircle to confess to their crime and clear Zayne's name. Master [[Xamar]] gave in and confessed to the Jedi Council, which then ordered an assault on the [[Draay Estate]], headquarters of the Covenant. Having already poisoned Krynda, Haazen set his plan into motion, initiating \"[[Vindication]],\" a contingency plan that was to be put into effect should the Jedi Council come under the influence of the Sith. \"Vindication\" placed the orbiting Republic fleet in Haazen's control, allowing him to kill many of the attacking Jedi with orbital bombardment. Carrick and Lucien Draay were the only two Jedi not forced to retreat, and although Haazen nearly pulled Draay to the dark side, the Jedi refused to join the Sith and instead killed Haazen by redirecting the Republic ships to fire directly at the Draay Estate. Both Carrick and Draay survived; however, neither returned to the Jedi Order, deciding to take different paths. Carrick and his friends later killed [[Toki Tollivar]], another Sith Acolyte who had been in hiding since the conclusion of the war.\n\n====The making of Revan====\n{{Quote|We'll go to the front&mdash;and beyond it, if it'll save the galaxy. Sometimes you have to enter the darkness to save the light.|[[Darth Malak|Alek]] on the [[Revanchist]]s|<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic 0\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 0|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 0]]</ref>}}\n[[File:Hoodedjediandalek.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Revan/Legends|Revan]], [[Darth Malak|Alek]], and several [[Revanchist]]s on [[Cathar (location)/Legends|Cathar]]]]\nAs tension in the Outer Rim escalated, several members of the Jedi Order began to voice their opposition to the Council's decision to remain uninvolved. Foremost among these dissidents was the Jedi Knight [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]. He, along with his close friend [[Darth Malak|Alek]], began to advocate for the Jedi to enter the war alongside the Republic. Although many Jedi remained loyal to the Council's decision, many younger Jedi joined Revan and Alek and began to scout the front lines. Revan's followers soon adopted the name \"[[Revanchist]]s\". As these renegades probed the borders between Mandalorian and Republic space, Taris descended into chaos following the \"Padawan Massacre\" and the departure of the Jedi Masters stationed there. Seeing his opportunity to seize the planet, Mandalore the Ultimate initiated the true Mandalorian War, unleashing his armada into Republic space and overwhelming the under-prepared security forces. The Republic suffered grievous losses in battles at [[First battle of Onderon (Mandalorian Wars)|Onderon]], [[Battle of Vanquo|Vanquo]], [[Attacks on the Zabrak colonies|several Outer Rim Colonies]], [[Taris Siege|Taris]], and [[Battle of Serroco|Serroco]].\n[[File:Trayusacademy.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Trayus Academy]] on [[Malachor V]]]]\nSeeing the carnage, Revan released records of the [[Battle of Cathar|Genocide of Cathar]], a Mandalorian operation that had occurred in the early stages of the war after the Council's refusal to take part in the conflict, to garner support for his cause. The reports shocked both the Republic and the Jedi, leading to more greater for both Revan and Alek, who had adopted the alias ''Malak'' since the events surrounding \"Vindication\". The two led the Revanchists (also known as the Jedi Crusaders) to join the Republic military and fight in battles across the galaxy. Revan and Malak, alongside [[Meetra Surik]], proved to be capable military commanders and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually gaining control over a full third of the Republic Navy. The soldiers under their command became incredibly loyal to the Jedi and increasingly averse to the Council and Knights who chose to remain out of the war. As Revan and Malak continued their crusade, the tide began to turn in their favor. The Mandalorian armies were [[Liberation of Taris|beaten back on Taris]] and [[Battle of Dxun|crushed at Dxun]]. Revan and Malak's tactics became increasingly brutal as the war raged on. They sacrificed countless Republic soldiers on Dxun simply to drive the Mandalorians off the moon and [[Battle of Althir (second)|decimated]] Mandalorian ground forces on [[Althir III|Althir]]. Soon the Mandalorians had retreated to their pre-war Empire in the unknown regions, pursued by Revan's forces. Revan was a hero to the Republic and the Jedi and appeared to have been vindicated in his defiance of the Council.\n\nHowever, appearances were deceiving. Early in the war, during Revan's original scouting of the area surrounding Mandalorian Space, he came upon [[Malachor V]], a world considered forbidden by Mandalorians. By this time the hidden Empire had forgotten the world. The Jedi traveled to the planet's surface and was immediately overwhelmed by dark side energies. Malachor had once belonged to the ancient Sith Empire, and was saturated with the dark side. In an effort to save himself from being consumed by the dark side, Revan fed off of it instead. He had also stumbled upon the [[Trayus Academy]], an ancient repository of Sith teachings built around a dark side geyser. It was there that he learned the location of Korriban and the existence of a hidden Sith Empire, the faction of the original Empire that had survived the Great Hyperspace War and been in hiding beyond the Unknown Regions for thousands of years. Revan, believing these Sith to be a greater evil than the Mandalorians, accepted the Sith way and the power it offered, hoping that he could defend the galaxy from this newly discovered threat. He also believed that these Sith had somehow influenced the Mandalorians into attacking the Republic. Revan introduced Malak to the teachings of the Sith, and together the two adopted the title of Sith Lords, with Revan as the Dark Lord and Malak as the Apprentice. They remade themselves into Darth Revan and Darth Malak, marking the first recorded use of the honorific ''Darth'' title. During the war, Revan also discovered a [[Star Map]] on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]- an ancient relic of the [[Infinite Empire/Legends|Infinite Empire]] which had attempted to conquer the original Sith people far before the creation of the Sith religious order. The Star Map hinted at the existence of an ancient superweapon that Revan would focus on finding after the war. The new Sith made preparations for the final battle of the Mandalorian Wars and their forces in the aftermath of the conflict. Sith teachings began to spread through the Republic fleet, going largely unquestioned, as Revan and Malak were still the heroes of the Republic.\n[[File:MalachorV.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The ruins of [[Malachor V]]]]\nThe new Dark Lord decided that Malachor V would be the final battleground, positioning a fleet of Republic ships in orbit consisting of crewmen and soldiers who were not fanatically loyal to him. The Mandalorians temptation for battle eclipsed their desire to avoid Malachor, and so began a [[Battle of Malachor V|final, massive assault]] on the Republic fleet which was being lead by Surik. Prior to the battle, Revan had entrusted her with the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]], a new superweapon designed by the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] engineer [[Bao-Dur]]. As the battle began, the Republic forces were overwhelmed and suffered crippling losses, but Revan soon arrived with reinforcements and the power of Sith teachings. He drew upon the dark energy of the planet below, invigorating his forces and drawing many of them to the dark side. Revan himself killed Mandalore the Ultimate, and the remaining Mandalorian forces were pushed towards Malachor. At this point the Jedi Crusader leading the fleet ordered the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator and watched in horror as thousands of ships from both the Mandalorian and Republic fleets were crushed in an artificial gravity well. The wreckage slammed into the planet and ruptured its crust, leaving nothing but a broken core. The countless deaths could be felt through the Force, causing the Jedi Crusader to cut herself off from the Force to avoid death. The battle ended with almost all of the Mandalorians killed, and the remaining declaring their unconditional surrender to Revan, who disbanded the warriors and sentenced them to perpetual exile. The surviving Jedi were either turned to the dark side or killed by Revan and Malak; however, the Dark Lord allowed the now-Force-dead Surik to escape and return to the Jedi Council on Coruscant, where she would be sentenced to exile for her actions during the war. Revan had single-handedly defeated the Mandalorian menace and could have returned to Coruscant as a hero, despite the tragedy over Malachor V.\n\nHowever, to everybody's surprise, he and Malak, along with a full third of the Republic fleet, disappeared into the Unknown Regions shortly after the Battle of Malachor. The official reason was that they were hunting down the last of the Mandalorians, but the Sith Lords and their fleet were actually searching the galaxy for the [[Star Forge]], the ancient weapon which Revan had learned about from the Star Map. Several years passed with the Republic receiving no word from the missing fleet, and it was assumed that the heroes of the Mandalorian Wars were dead.\n\n===The Jedi Civil War and the redemption of Darth Revan===\n{{Quote|The hero had become a conqueror.|[[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Dorak]]|<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" />}}\n[[File:RevanMalak-SithEmperor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Revan and Malak confront the [[Tenebrae|Sith Emperor]] in the Unknown Regions.]]\nHowever, Revan and Malak were very much alive. During their time in the Unknown Regions, they encountered a [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]] established by the [[Tenebrae|Sith Emperor]]. The Dark Lord converted them to his cause and recruited them. These two Sith Lords were dispatched back into Republic space to locate the [[Star Forge]] to allow the Empire to drastically boost its military production. Unfortunately for the Emperor, Darths Revan and Malak became overly ambitious without his direct supervision and claimed the Star Forge for themselves.<ref name=\"Timeline8\">{{TORweb|url=holonet/galactic-history|text=Timeline 8: The Jedi Civil War|int=Timeline 8: The Jedi Civil War}}</ref> Revan began a campaign to end the \"tyranny\" of the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] once and for all. Together with Malak, Revan went to [[Korriban/Legends|Korriban]] and seized control of the planet, secretly establishing a new [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith academy]] not far from the settlement [[Dreshdae]].\n\nAbout a year after Revan's return to known space, the [[Battle of Foerost (Jedi Civil War)|first battle]] of the new conflict, the [[Jedi Civil War]], began. In a surprise attack, Revan's fleet swept into the unprepared [[Foerost/Legends|Foerost]] system, quickly overcoming their defenses. It was after this battle that Revan and Malak officially announced to the galaxy that they now were now Sith Lords, Darth Revan and Darth Malak, and captured the majority of the Republic Fleet based in the drydocks around Foerost, dealing a crippling blow to the Republic. The second planet to be attacked by the Sith was [[Telos IV]], a strategically-important planet on the edge of Republic-controlled space whose military and economic power bases were considered vital to the Republic. Although Darth Revan had intended for Telos to be conquered, Darth Malak ordered the former Republic admiral [[Saul Karath]] to prove his loyalty to the Sith by destroying Telos - Karath complied.\n\n[[File:Malakart-crop.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Darth Malak]], [[Revan/Legends|Darth Revan's]] Sith apprentice and successor.]]\n\nWhile a destructive war, Revan sought to do as little damage to the Republic's infrastructure as possible. Under his leadership, Sith forces bypassed militarily vital planets that would be required for the defense of the galaxy against the threat of the hidden Sith Empire. Revan never intended to 'destroy' the Republic, but to unite it under his banner, so it was vital for him to keep the Republic largely intact for the purposes of post-war rebuilding. Revan, seeing the need for corporate assistance in providing necessary material for the war effort, entered a partnership with the [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]], a galaxy-spanning conglomerate with such diverse interests as mining, slaving, and manufacturing items such as arms, armor, and droids. Offered a trade monopoly within Sith space, the corporation helped to sponsor the establishment and growth of the Dreshdae colony on Korriban as part of their supply network. The corporation continued to provide logistical support for the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] throughout the course of the war. They also secured diplomatic relations with the ocean planet of [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]] so that they would able to export the healing substance known as [[Kolto/Legends|kolto]]. Revan even took out a number of political figureheads who stood in his way. Amongst them was: [[Yusanis]] of the [[Echani/Legends|Echani]], [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Mimas Yoon]] of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], and [[Lelin-Dor]] of [[Serroco]]. By doing so Revan would be able to begin his rule with a functioning army and a stable economy without his rule being questioned. He believed that even if he were to fail in his conquest of the Republic, the result would be the same; a stronger Republic more capable of defending itself against the hidden [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]].\n\nUnlike most, Revan understood that his war was never truly against the Republic, but against the Jedi. Revan believed that whoever had the most and the strongest Jedi would win the war. He would either convert or kill captured Jedi, relying on secrecy instead of brute force. His [[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassins]] quietly flooded into the Republic to achieve this goal Jedi throughout known space. Revan reestablished old strongholds and academies upon worlds of ancient power such as [[Lehon/Legends|Lehon]], [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], and [[Korriban/Legends|Korriban]]. There his most faithful servants broke captured Jedi and converted them to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. If any [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] was found within his ranks he captured them as well and made them into [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]].\n\n[[File:RevanVSBastila.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Bastila Shan]] confronts Darth Revan during [[Capture of Darth Revan|his capture]].]]\n\nDarth Revan's tactical brilliance caught the Republic completely off-guard and the Sith won battle after battle until a young [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] named [[Bastila Shan]] entered the fray. Bastila could use [[Battle meditation/Legends|battle meditation]], a powerful Force-power that increased the combat effectiveness of the Republic's forces and sapped the will of enemy combatants. The Republic knew, however, that even with Bastila's powerful battle meditation, they wouldn't be able to stand against the Sith for long, so the Jedi Council drafted a plan to capture Darth Revan, thus depriving the Sith of their greatest leader and tactician. While Darth Revan's fleet was distracted by a small force of Republic warships, a Jedi strike-team consisting of Bastila Shan and a number of Jedi Knights boarded Revan's flagship, overcoming his guards and cornering the Dark Lord on the bridge. Darth Malak, determined to become the Sith Master, ordered the ships under his command to fire upon the bridge of his mentor's flagship, intending to kill both the Jedi boarding party and his master in order to claim the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith for himself.\n\nUnknown to the newly crowned Dark Lord Darth Malak, his old mentor was still very much alive. As the only other survivor of the attack, Bastila Shan used the Force to preserve the flicker of life that remained within the unconscious Dark Lord. This act created a [[Force-bond/Legends|Force bond]] between the two, an event that would have lasting repercussions in the future. Shan then brought Darth Revan to the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Jedi Council]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], where they used the Force to temporarily wipe his memory. Revan was then reprogrammed with a new identity, one loyal to the Republic, while Bastila Shan was charged with keeping Darth Revan's identity hidden and drawing out the former Dark Lord's memories.\n\n===Reign of Darth Malak and Revan's reemergence===\n{{Quote|What greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause? To use their own knowledge against them.|[[Bastila Shan]]|audio=Greaterweapon2.flac|<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" />}}\nAlthough Darth Malak lacked the tactical superiority of his former master, relying instead on brute force, the sheer size of his armadas allowed him to win many victories over the battered and outnumbered Republic forces. Unlike Darth Revan, Darth Malak would destroy worlds rather than capture them, taking away vital resources from both sides. Throughout the conflict Darth Malak became much more reliant upon the Star Forge than Revan had been. He took a former Jedi whose quest for power had set him apart from his fellow students and named him [[Darth Bandon]], making him his [[Shadow Hand]] and the second-in-command in the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]]. As his forces tore through Republic space, Darth Malak felt that the only thing that could stop him from taking over the galaxy was Shan's powerful battle meditation. Therefore, he expended tremendous resources to locate and capture Shan, hoping to turn her to his cause or kill her if this proved impossible.\n[[File:MalakSithEmpire.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Darth Malak]] leads his [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith troopers]] and [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] into battle.]]\nAs the war raged on, Revan, under an implanted name and with no recollection of his real history or of his former mastery of the Force, was enlisted as a common soldier in the Republic army and placed on the Republic warship [[Endar Spire]]. Darth Malak's hunt for Shan led him to this ship, where he sent Darth Bandon, along with a Sith armada, to ambush the ship. There, while boarding the vessel, Darth Bandon encountered Revan, but before he had the chance to kill the amnesiac Dark Lord, a Republic ensign sacrificed himself so that Revan could escape the ship. Shan successfully fled the ship aboard one of the escape pods and crash-landed on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], as did Revan and the Republic [[Commander/Legends|commander]] [[Carth Onasi]]. Malak ordered a blockade of the planet so that the Sith could search for Shan.\n[[File:DarthBandon3.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Darth Bandon]], Darth Malak's Sith apprentice]]\nAfter crash-landing on the surface of Taris, Revan began experiencing flashbacks through the Force of his buried past. On Taris, Revan and Onasi had to [[Rescue of Bastila Shan|rescue]] Bastila Shan from the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]] [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] gang with the assistance of the young [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Mission Vao]], her [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] partner [[Zaalbar]], and the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] war veteran [[Canderous Ordo]]. With the help of his new droid companion, [[T3-M4]], Revan was able to steal the bypass codes to the Sith blockade from the [[Tarisian military base|Sith base]] and could escape the planet. However, once Revan and his newly formed team (which included Bastila) left the surface, Darth Malak ordered an orbital bombardment of the planet, hoping to eliminate Bastila together with the billions of Tarisians living on its surface.\n[[File:Starmap2.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The [[Star Map]] Revan found on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]]]\nDeciding to regroup, Revan and his companions fled to the [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. There, Revan was trained again in the ways of the Force by a reluctant Jedi Council. During his training he performed various important tasks in the area around the Enclave. Among these tasks was to cleanse a meditation grove of a dark taint. The taint soon turned out to be a [[Cathar/Legends|Cathar]] [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] named [[Juhani]], who he redeemed and convinced to return to return to the Jedi. Soon afterwards, Shan and Revan shared a dream of Revan and Malak exploring the [[Rakatan ruins (Dantooine)|nearby ruins]] and discovering a [[Star Map]], a Rakatan artifact that, when combined with the other four Star Maps, Revan had used to find the location of the Star Forge. Upon learning this, the Jedi Council placed it upon Revan and Shan to travel to the worlds where the other Star Maps were hidden and find the location of the Star Forge. Although the Council still wanted Bastila to continue to draw out Revan's memories, they were also curious to see if Revan could accomplish this mission without falling to the dark side. Juhani also requested that she be allowed to join Revan's party.\n\nRevan, Shan, and their companions journeyed to these worlds, retracing the steps of Darth Revan and Malak from years before. During these travels they gained two new companions; on Tatooine, Revan purchased [[HK-47]], the [[Assassin droid/Legends|assassin droid]] that he had created as a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]], and on Kashyyyk, the self-exiled Jedi named [[Jolee Bindo]] joined his party. Additionally, the crew of the Ebon Hawk found themselves hunted by both the Sith and bounty hunters and confronted with the problems of the local populace at every turn. One of their greatest challenges was when Darth Bandon finally caught up with the party, only to meet his end at the hands of Revan. Throughout their journey, Revan and Bastila grew closer due to the feelings created by their Force bond. Bastila feared their love, thinking it would lead to the dark side. In truth, she was afraid to face her feelings, out of fear of who Revan once was. She attempted to resist the feelings, but their love was too great to avoid.\n\nAs the crew searched for the final Star Map, Revan and his allies were captured by the Sith flagship [[Leviathan (Interdictor-class cruiser)|Leviathan]] under the command of Admiral Saul Karath. As the Ebon Hawk was being brought in via [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]], its crew decided that it would be best for another member of the party to use their talents to either avoid or escape confinement and then liberate the rest of the crew. Aboard the ship, Admiral Karath interrogated Revan, Shan and Onasi personally, informing them of the [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|destruction of the Dantooine Enclave]] as he attempted to extract information from them; however, despite their torture, Karath was unable to learn anything. After the Admiral's eventual departure, both Bastila and Revan determined that Karath had sent a message to Darth Malak with their location and that he was making his way towards them. Meanwhile, the Ebon Hawk crewmember succeeded in getting away from their guards and managed to unlock the holding cells and force cages that held the rest of the group captive.\n[[File:Sithfleetkotor2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Sith Navy amassing around the [[Star Forge]]]]\nReunited, the crew worked together to escape the Leviathan. On the way, the crew confronted Admiral Karath on the bridge deck, and a furious battle took place, resulting in the Admiral's death. With his dying breaths, the onetime Republic officer told Onasi of Revan's true nature. Making a break for it, the crew fled towards the Ebon Hawk, but, despite their haste, the trio was intercepted by the Dark Lord. As surprised as he was amused at the events that had transpired since his betrayal, Darth Malak gleefully filled Revan in on the details of who he was&mdash;and what he had been made into. Revan, shocked by the revelation, asked Bastila if Malak spoke the truth. She affirmed said truth and went on to explain everything. Following their brief discussion, Darth Malak created a [[Stasis field/Legends|stasis field]] around Shan and Onasi and prepared to end his former Master. Revan proved himself a capable swordsman, holding his own against the Dark Lord. However, Shan intervened so that Revan and Onasi could escape. Darth Malak defeated and captured her. Reluctantly, Revan and Onasi left, and escaped the Leviathan with the rest of their crew. Revan was thus forced to deal with Darth Malak's revelation and the loss of his beloved Bastila.\n\n[[File:RakataTemple.png|thumb|right|250px|The [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] outside the [[Temple of the Ancients]].]]\nDarth Malak then attempted to turn Bastila to the dark side and become his new [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]], torturing her with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]. She was firm at first, but after a week of endless torture, he succeeded in breaking her and turned her to the dark side. Shan became his apprentice, replacing the slain Darth Bandon. His primary motive in this was to gain the power of her battle meditation. Meanwhile, the preparations for the Star Forge were nearing completion and the Sith forces had grown greater than ever before, and Revan found the fifth and final Star Map, rediscovering the location of the Star Forge.\n\nUpon arriving, the Ebon Hawk was crashed on the [[Lehon/Legends|unknown planet]] because of its [[disruptor field]]. With their [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] damaged, Onasi was forced to make an emergency landing on one of the planet's smaller islands&mdash;the very same island that held the [[Temple of the Ancients]]. After several run-ins with the native Rakata, Revan was able to piece together what had transpired during his and Malak's last visit to the forgotten world. With the help of the Rakata, he, accompanied by Jolee Bindo and Juhani, entered the Temple of the Ancients in order to shut down the disruptor field so that the incoming Republic fleet would not suffer a similar fate. At the top the Temple they were confronted by Bastila; now a Sith apprentice to Darth Malak. Mocking the three and taunting the anguished Revan, she engaged them in a brief lightsaber duel. Shan was no match for Revan's power and threw a [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force wave]] at the three in order to save herself from defeat. After seeing how powerful Revan was, she came to believe that Revan deserved to be the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]]. She attempted to entice Revan to reclaim his former title and take her as his apprentice. Revan rejected Bastila's temptation, choosing the path of the Jedi, and tried to turn Bastila back to the light, reminding her of the of love between them. Angered at her failure to turn Revan, Shan retreated to the Star Forge, where she and Revan would face each other again during the [[Battle of Rakata Prime|final battle]].\n\n====The Fall of Darth Malak and Revan's departure to the Unknown Regions====\n{{Quote|Once again, we shall face each other in single combat, and the victor will decide the fate of the galaxy.|Darth Malak to Revan|<ref name=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\" />}}\n[[File:ShadowsandLight2.jpg|thumb|left|300|The defeat of Darth Malak at the hands of a redeemed Revan, as envisioned by [[Duron Qel-Droma]].]]\nRevan and his crew repaired the Ebon Hawk and pursued Shan as a Republic fleet and a group of surviving Jedi from the Jedi Enclave arrived, commencing an assault on the Star Forge. Revan, with his two companions and a Jedi strike team, boarded the Star Forge in hopes of disrupting Shan's battle meditation long enough to give the Republic fleet a chance. Aboard the Star Forge, Revan displayed his restored affinity for the Force and mastery of lightsaber combat by confronting and defeating Malak's army of Star Forge [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] and Dark Jedi with little help from others. In the Star Forge's war room, Revan faced off against Shan once again, this time alone. Although Shan was able to draw on the Star Forge to renew her strength, Revan still bested her. She begged Revan to kill her after all she had done, but Revan attempted to convince her to return to the light side by drawing on the powerful bond of love they shared. He succeeded, and Shan used her battle meditation to aid the Republic, turning the tide of the battle.\n\nAs Shan used her powers to shift the balance of power, Revan went on to confront Darth Malak atop the highest levels of the station. There Revan faced Darth Malak in a brutal [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]] during which the Dark Lord attempted to siphon off the remaining Force-energy of several dead Jedi; Revan, however, was able to use his own power to prevent this. After defeating his former apprentice, he and Shan, along with Onasi and the others, boarded the Ebon Hawk and escaped the station's destruction. With the Star Forge destroyed, the will of the remaining Sith forces in orbit was broken and they were defeated; as a result of this action, the destructive war that had claimed so many lives&mdash;on both sides&mdash;finally came to an end. Revan and his crew were given a hero's escort back to [[Lehon/Legends|Lehon]]. There, they were each rewarded with the [[Cross of Glory]], the Republic's highest award. [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vandar Tokare]] also thanked Revan, re-bestowing his rank of Jedi Knight and proclaiming him the \"Prodigal Knight\", and his friends as the heroes of the era and galaxy.\n\nAfter the war's end, however, Revan began to recover more and more of his lost memories despite what the Jedi had done to wipe them away. As time went on, the former Dark Lord remembered the threat posed by the hidden Sith Empire that he had encountered in the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Leaving behind Shan, those who had served alongside him at war's end, and all of his possessions, Revan departed known space in order to face this threat in his own way. The exiled [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kreia]], who had taught Revan when he was still a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], had gone in search of both him and what had driven him to leave the Republic behind and wage a war against it; eventually she too found [[Malachor V]] and, corrupted by its dark energies, began to form the [[Sith Triumvirate]].\n\n===The Sith Triumvirate and the First Jedi Purge===\n{{Quote|To be united by hatred is a&hellip; fragile alliance at best.|Kreia|<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />}}\n[[File:TrayusCore.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The heart of the [[Trayus Academy]].]]\nWith the death of Darth Malak and Revan's disappearance, the Sith were left with a massive power vacuum that resulted in their own [[Sith Civil War|civil war]]. The lesser Sith Lords of the Empire, left without a strong leader, turned upon each other, attempting to take what scraps they could from the ruins of the Empire. Declaring themselves sovereign warlords, they fractured the empire into a number of small, hotly-contested kingdoms. At the height of the civil war on Korriban, Revan led a host of Jedi in an [[Skirmish on Korriban|invasion]] of the Sith homeworld, and his forces successfully drove the Sith Lords from the planet. When Republic forces arrived on Korriban approximately a year after the Jedi Civil War's conclusion, they found the planet to be barren and lifeless. With the fall of the Sith Empire, the Galactic Republic was able to conquer Sith space, and reclaim worlds that had been under Sith control since the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]].\n\nAfter the fall of Korriban, only one Sith faction remained active in Republic space, a secretive and elusive Sith faction known as the [[Sith Triumvirate]], led by the three Sith Lords [[Kreia|Darth Traya]] and her apprentices [[Darth Sion]] and [[Darth Nihilus]]. Darth Traya was the Sith alias of the former Jedi Master Kreia, the first and last master of Revan, who was exiled by the Jedi Council for her part in Revan's training, and of others who the Council deemed as failures.\n\nAfter her exile from the Order, Kreia started questioning her beliefs and philosophy. She began searching for answers, meeting those she had affected through her teachings. Eventually, she came to [[Malachor V]], a dead world, powerful in the dark side. She was curious, and the Sith ruins drew her in. She became overpowered with the allure of the dark side, and became Darth Traya, the \"Lord of Betrayal,\" having been betrayed by the Jedi and ready to betray in turn. She attained the title of headmistress of the [[Trayus Academy]], able to hold any students willing to fight for the cause of the Sith: to destroy the Jedi.\n\nTwo more Sith Lords came to join forces with Darth Traya on Malachor. The first was [[Darth Nihilus]], the \"Lord of Hunger,\" who before becoming a Sith, lost everything to the Mandalorians during the war. A survivor of the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] in the war's final battle at Malachor V, the experience of the shadows made him \"hunger\" for [[Force energy]] and the affliction began to ravage his body. In his pain he became a [[Wound in the Force/Legends|wound in the Force]] and was found by Darth Traya. She told him that she could teach him to feed his hunger. He accepted her offer, becoming Traya's apprentice. The next to come was [[Darth Sion]], the \"Lord of Pain,\" a long-time Sith, having served [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun's]] [[Sith Empire (Exar Kun)/Legends|Sith Empire]] until the day he was struck down.\n\n[[File:DarthSion-CG.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Darth Sion strikes down a Jedi.]]\nRather than die, Sion found that by calling on his pain, anger, and hatred, he could rise from certain death and achieve immortality at the cost of all-consuming agony. With a body fractured and decomposing but held together by the dark side of the Force, Sion survived the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]]. When the civil war broke out Sion fled Korriban, he came to Malachor V, where he found the Trayus Academy and Darth Traya. His brutality and strength were noted by Traya during his tutelage under her, but the two soon disliked each other because rather than yearn for knowledge or studies as she did, he sought hatred and power.\n\nAt the completion of their training, these three became co-rulers of an Empire. The remnants of Revan and Malak's forces soon joined them on Malachor V where they subtly intervened with galactic affairs, using Traya's idea of echoes in the Force and corrupting Jedi to the dark side. Sion quickly grew impatient of waiting to fight the Jedi and the Republic while Nihilus grew hungry and in need of Force sustenance. The two conspired against Traya for a time, and when she was vulnerable, they struck. She was cornered from two sides in the Trayus Core while meditating and violently subdued. During this time, the two Lords used an unknown Force technique to sever her connection to the Force, though this allowed their master to turn the dark side of the Force. Traya, Lord of Betrayal, was betrayed again.\n\nCast out by both Jedi and Sith, Kreia directed her attention towards Meetra Surik, a Jedi who followed Revan into the Mandalorian Wars and was exiled from the Jedi Order for severing her ties to the Force. Kreia took Surik as her student as Sion and Nihilus, now with dual control of the remnants of the Empire, split the Empire into equal portions and went their separate ways as though they shared the belief in Jedi extermination, their conflicting philosophies, their being as Sith, ruled out working together.\n\nThey took their respective factions into hiding and initiated a covert shadow war against the Jedi, starting the [[First Jedi Purge]]. Sion led an army of [[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassins]] from the Trayus academy in a bloody crusade, while Nihilus worked from his ship controlling his half-dead thralls and using his powers to feed on the life-force of entire worlds, gravitating towards planets with a Jedi presence.\n\nThough working independently, the two reduced the number of surviving Jedi down to less than one hundred by [[3951 BBY]].\n\n===The Jedi Exile===\n====Survival and search====\n{{Quote|No game of dejarik can be won without pawns, and this may prove to be a very long game.|Kreia|<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />}}\n[[File:Kreia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kreia during her exile]]\nWhile the new Dark Lords thought Darth Traya dead, this was not the case. Left extremely weakened, she managed to escape and went into self imposed exile. Claiming the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', Revan's old ship, for herself, she proceed to wander the galaxy, searching for a specific Jedi veteran of the Mandalorian wars.\n\nThe veteran in question was Meetra Surik, a high ranking Republic general who had led numerous battles and was involved in the final battle at [[Malachor V]]. It was she who ordered the Zabrak engineer [[Bao-Dur]] to activate the Mass Shadow Generator at Malachor, decimating the Mandalorian fleet. With the end of the war, she was the only Jedi to answer the Jedi Council's summons and return to Coruscant. Within the High Council Chamber within the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, she stood before the Jedi for judgment. Due to her experiences at Malachor V, she had involuntarily disconnected herself from the Force, becoming a wound in the Force, an empty void. Sensing the emptiness within her, and unsure how to deal with it or its ramifications, the council exiled her.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nSurik took to wandering the galaxy, gradually revisiting most of the old battlegrounds where she had fought. As she traveled to Telos aboard the Republic cruiser [[Harbinger (Hammerhead-class)|''Harbinger'']], she was drugged and stowed away by an [[HK-50 series assassin droid|HK-50]] assassin droid looking to collect on the Jedi bounty posted by the Exchange crime syndicate. However, as this took place, the ''Harbinger'' encountered the ''Ebon Hawk'', which was being pursued by a Sith warship commanded by Darth Sion. The ''Hawk'' was allowed to land on the ''Harbinger'' while it docked with the Sith warship and searched it. Kreia, Darth Traya no longer, found Surik and took her aboard the ''Ebon Hawk'', unknowingly followed by the HK-50. At the same time, the ''Harbinger'' search teams found the Sith warship empty with the exception of a heavily mutilated body that somehow remained just barely alive despite the extreme damage it showed.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nThe \"body\" was revealed to be Darth Sion himself. Sion relied on his rage-fuelled power in the Force to literally pull his body back together, achieving a form of immortality and used this ability to masquerade as a dead body. However, as he could only keep his body together, not repair the damage it sustained, he was left in constant agony and had the appearance of that which he pretended to be; a corpse.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n====Harbinger====\nBursting out of the Kolto tank that his body had been placed in, he commandeered the ship with the aid of the Sith Assassin crew of his warship that had secretly infiltrated the ''Harbinger'' when it had docked with his own ship via umbilical. As he took over, Kreia took off in the ''Ebon Hawk'' with the drugged Surik in tow. However, the now Sith-controlled ''Harbinger'' fired on the ''Hawk'' as it jumped into hyperspace, forcing the ship to make a droid controlled landing at the Peragus Mining Facility.\n\nAt the facility, the blacked out Surik and near-dead Kreia were placed in the medical bay while the HK-50 stowaway assumed the role of the facilities maintenance assistant. The assassin droid used his new position to reprogram the facilities droid miners to attack the organic ones, fool the computers into believing that there was an explosion, confining the remaining miners to the reinforced dormitories, sabotage the ventilation system to kill the trapped miners, and cause all the med-bay patients, including the Exile, to receive a near-lethal dose of sedative.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n[[File:HarbingerBridge.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Sion on the corpse-strewn bridge of the ''Harbinger'']]\nWhile the other patients were killed by this, Surik's Jedi training enabled her to withstand the effects and survive, as HK-50 anticipated. However, she withstood the effects far better than the droid intended and awoke. Wandering the medbay, Surik encountered the now recovered Kreia and began searching the facility for an escape route, meeting the confined [[Atton Rand]]. With Rand's help, they managed to find a way to the hanger, where the ''Ebon Hawk'' was kept. Fortunately, the ship had been repaired under orders from the HK-50 to serve as an escape vehicle. However, before they could escape, the ''Harbinger'', under Sion's command, arrived at the facility and docked. As they needed the current asteroid drift charts to navigate the field surrounding Peragus, they were forced to board the ''Harbinger'' to obtain them, battling and destroying the HK-50 along the way.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nUnfortunately, before they could make good their escape, they encountered Darth Sion.\n\nWhile Atton Rand and Surik fled to the ''Ebon Hawk'', Kreia remained behind to hold off Sion. After a short conversation between the two, during which Kreia hid from her former apprentice with the Force, Sion took advantage of a momentary lapse in her illusion to [[Cho mai/Legends|amputate]] her hand with a lightning fast strike. This caused a Force link between Kreia and Surik to reveal itself, as Surik felt Kreia's pain. Despite this, they managed to escape to Telos.\n\nUnfortunately, the Peragus Mining Facility was destroyed by Sion as he pursued them, an event that would have drastic ramifications for the Republic.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n====Telos====\nTheir visit to Telos was a total debacle. Firstly, as they had come from Peragus, they were arrested in connection with the destruction of the facility. While in custody, the ''Ebon Hawk'' was stolen and they were attacked by a bounty hunter that had infiltrated the Telos Security Force, then they were confined to house arrest, and while they were eventually let go, they were still confined to the Telos Citadel Station in orbit above the ravaged world. Though they managed to procure a shuttle to journey down to one of the restoration zones on Telos's surface, they were shot down by a Czerka Corporation survey team.\n\nFortunately, they encountered [[Bao-Dur]], who had taken a job as shield technician on Telos. He pulled them out of the burning wreck and helped them escape the restoration zone, commandeering a shuttle in the ruins of the Telos military base. In the shuttle, they flew to a secret academy established by Jedi Master [[Atris]] at the north pole of Telos. There the Exile met with Atris and negotiated the return of the ''Ebon Hawk'', which had been stolen by her agents.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n[[File:DespiteAllMyRageIAmStillJustASithInACage.png|thumb|right|250px|Kreia blackmails Atton Rand.]]\nWhile Surik met with Atris, Kreia forcefully probed Atton Rand's mind, discovering that he had been one of the Sith Troopers during the Jedi Civil War, specializing in Jedi hunting&hellip; and torturing. Atton, who was deeply ashamed of his actions, was blackmailed by Kreia to be an instrument of her manipulations.\n\n====Mission====\nOnce under way again, the Exile resolved to gather the remaining Jedi, supposedly to fight back against the Sith, but truly to get an explanation of what happened to her and why she was exiled.\n\nThey proceeded to journey to the various worlds the Jedi masters were last known to have been. On [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], they found Master [[Vrook Lamar]] and aided him at defeating an Exchange-controlled mercenary army bent on destroying the worlds fragile government. On [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], they became involved in the vicious intrigue between the Exchange, the Hutt crime lords, and the Bounty Hunters guild. In the end, Surik was captured by [[G0-T0|Goto]], the Exchange crime boss controlling Nar Shaddaa. In the midst of all this, Jedi Master [[Zez-Kai Ell]] revealed himself and helped rescue Surik from Goto. \"Goto\", his control over Nar Shaddaa in shamble, joined Surik's party, revealing himself to actually be the droid; G0-T0. Obsessed with order and with no affiliation to any party, G0-T0 sought to use the Exile as an instrument to create order. Fortunately, as G0-T0 was the one who originally placed the bounty on the Jedi in the first place, his joining of their party forced him to rescind it.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nOn Onderon, they became involved with the Onderon Civil War between the hereditary ruler Queen Talia and the isolationist militant upstart General Vaklu. Gaining the aid of the Mandalorians, now led by Canderous Ordo, they managed to end the war, siding with Talia and the royalists. However, they found out that the militant faction led by Vaklu had been receiving aid from the Sith, specifically Darth Nihilus's faction. While the war was ended and Jedi Master [[Kavar]], who had been serving as Talia's advisor during the crisis, was freed up to join the gathering on Dantooine.\n\nOn Korriban, they found the corpse of [[Lonna Vash]] in the torture chamber of the Sith Academy. As they prepared to leave, they encountered Darth Sion. After a quick lightsaber duel, they were forced to flee. Sion let them go, feeling that the Jedi Exile had earned the right.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n====Battle of Telos====\n[[File:KOTOR2Nihilus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Darth Nihilus]]\nDuring the Onderon Civil War, Kreia allowed one of General Vaklu's subordinates, the Colonel Tobin, to escape. Tobin fled to Nihilus and told the Sith Lord the information given him by Kreia regarding the existence of the Jedi academy Atris established on Telos. The information was a lie, the only Jedi there was Atris herself while the rest of the residents were Echani handmaidens trained to resist the Force. In any case, Nihilus prepared to attack Telos in order to drain the apparent Jedi Academy and once again sate his hunger.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nAs this took place, Surik traveled to Dantooine and met with the masters. Unfortunately, the masters decided that Surik's condition as a wound in the Force made her a threat to the Force itself, and prepared to use their powers to permanently sever her connection to it. However, before they could do so, Kreia burst in on them. Kreia used the Force to [[Force drain/Legends|drain]] their connection to it, killing them. While Surik laid unconscious, Kreia was led to Jedi Master Atris for judgment by one of Surik's companions, the [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] [[Handmaiden/Legends|Handmaiden]] [[Brianna]]. Journeying to the Telosian Jedi Academy, Kreia revealed that Atris had herself been corrupted and turned to the dark side by the [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]] she gathered, but could not admit it even to herself. Atris, the new Darth Traya per Kreia's words, then embraced the dark side openly, but was soon confronted and defeated by the Exile.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nWith the new Traya defeated, Surik turned her attention to Darth Nihilus, who had just arrived in-system. While the Republic fleet arrived to hold Nihilus's fleet, Surik boarded the Sith Lord's flagship, the ''Ravager'', and with the aid of Canderous Ordo's Mandalorian commandos, they prepared to destroy the ship. As this was done, Surik confronted Darth Nihilus and engaged the Sith Lord in combat.\n\nThe Sith Lord attempted to absorb Surik's Force energy, however, he failed and exhausted himself. This was due to Surik's natural ability to draw on the Force energy of those around her, mirroring Nihilus's, as a result of her tie to the Force being cut at the end of the Battle of Malachor V. They engaged in a quick fight, with the Dark Lord seemingly too strong to defeat. Then, Surik learned of his aversion to her Force energy signature and turned the tide against him. Nihilus's former apprentice, [[Visas Marr]], now one of Surik's companions, entered a trance and tried to disrupt the link with her former Master, undermining his connection to the Force through their Force bond. Nihilus was defeated, vanishing in a haze of dark side energy.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n====The echo's death====\n{{Quote|I want you to be complete, as you were meant to be. To let the echo die, and hear the sound of the Force again.|Kreia, to Meetra Surik|<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />}}\n[[File:Kreiareturnstomalacho.jpg|thumb|right|Kreia]]\nKreia returned to the Trayus Academy, subverting Darth Sion and convincing him that she was his master Darth Traya once more. Having reclaimed the forces of the Sith, Kreia waited for Surik. Meetra Surik, following information from Atris, arrived on Malachor and stormed the Sith academy. Fighting her way through the army of Sith assassins and apprentices populating the training center, she confronted Darth Sion at the entrance to the Trayus core.\n\nAfter a lengthy battle, she convinced the Sith Lord to let go of his rage and allow himself to die. As Sion became that which he appeared to be, he expressed relief at finally leaving the world. Surik entered the core and confronted Kreia. After a discussion where Kreia revealed her disgust towards the idea of the \"Will of the Force\", and her intention to strip the Force of its will, Kreia forced her student into a duel to the death. Their bout abruptly ended when Surik cut off Kreia's remaining hand. However, the Sith used her telekinetic abilities to summon up a trio of lightsabers to assail Surik. Surik managed to cut down the weapons and defeat Kreia. As her mentor died, Meetra Surik was whole; Surik let go of Kreia to remain alive as an individual.\n\nWhile this took place, one of Bao-Dur's droids made its way through the wastes of Malachor V and found the remains of the Mass Shadow Generator in several crashed ships. Reactivating the weapon, the Trayus Academy was destroyed while Surik and her companions managed to escape aboard the salvaged ''Ebon Hawk''.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nThe threat of the Sith was once again thwarted.\n\n===The Empire's Spy, and Naga Sadow's Return===\n{{Quote|They were a family of Sith Infiltrators.|Jedi Master [[Gnost-Dural]] speaks of the [[Ovair family]]|<ref name=\"Timeline7\">{{TORweb|url=holonet/galactic-history|text=Timeline 7: Peace for the Republic?|int=Timeline 7: Peace for the Republic?}}</ref>}}\n[[File:Ovaircloseup.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Barel Ovair, a Sith Infiltrator posing as a Jedi]]\nAlthough the Jedi thought the Sith were defeated, the Sith Empire that Revan had once encountered still existed. In fact, they had planted a Sith infiltrator within the Jedi Order itself, [[Barel Ovair]]. Barel selected [[Eison Gynt]] to be his Padawan, and together traveled the galaxy studying the Force and accepting the most dangerous of missions for the Order.\n\nOvair was then given a mission by his superiors; he must destroy all of the long dead spirits of the Sith, who might attempt to challenge the [[Tenebrae|Sith Emperor's]] return. Thus, the spy and his Padawan undertook the [[Mission to Yavin 4]]. The Jedi Order and Gynt believed they were to destroy the spirit of [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]], which still lingered in his tomb on the planet, in order to finally cleanse the Dark Side planet, so Barel was free to defeat the spirit without hesitation. Unfortunately, the pair was attacked by [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] warriors that still lived on the surface, and they were forced to retreat into the temple of the dead Sith Lord.\n\n[[File:DarkGynt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Eison Gynt, possessed by Naga Sadow]]\nLater, Ovair returned to Coruscant injured and half-mad. His report to the Jedi Council was that Gynt had been killed during the mission, and the Jedi believed his lies. Eison was indeed alive, and even possessed by the spirit of Naga Sadow. Years later, the possessed Gynt arrived on Coruscant, and immediately challenged his old master to a duel. The two fought, and although Eison's powers were bolstered by Sadow's, Ovair was victorious, and slew his ex-Padawan. Ovair was questioned by the Jedi after the fight, but they once again believed him and he was treated as a hero.\n\n===Resurgence of the Sith Empire===\n{{Expand|1}}\n{{Quote|Our time has come.

However, with his plans largely undone by Malak's rampage, he journeyed into the Unknown Regions to search out the Empire and possibly stem the tide. Whatever his intent or actions, the Sith Empire ultimately returned.\n\nIt had been three centuries since the Jedi Civil War, Revan's disappearance, and the collapse of the Sith Triumvirate. The Sith were thought long dead, so the invasion came as a total surprise. Their invasion marked the beginning of the decades long Great War.\n\nThe Sith quickly seized most of the Outer Rim, destroying the Sluis Van shipyards. The battlegrounds spread to include such remote worlds as Ilum or Dathomir. Despite Manaan's attempts to remain neutral, it was ravaged by the Sith, and the Republic suffered further defeats at Agamar and Utapau. However, a heroic struggle at Bothawui helped slow the Sith onslaught, and the Jedi were able to bring the dark-siders advance to a halt in the Mid Rim. It was during this time that the Sith Emperor hatched a plan to capture enemy combatants and program into them his very essence. His apprentice [[Exal Kressh]] betrayed him and led a republic attack on the Sith homeworld of Korriban. There she faced [[Darth Thanaton|Teneb Kel]], the Sith apprentice chosen to hunt her down.\n\n[[File:MandalorethePawn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The new Mandalore meeting with Imperial agents]]\n\nHowever, things for the Republic were vastly complicated by the rebirth of the Mandalorians. In the bloody arenas of Geonosis, a gladiator who called himself the \"New Mandalore\" rose to prominence. The Sith Imperial Intelligence saw a tremendous opportunity in this gladiator. Dispatching agents to rig the arena bouts, they ensured the warrior's epic rise to power. Beating all his opponents in the arena, the gladiator claimed the currently defunct title of Mandalore. All surviving Mandalorians answered the New Mandalore's call and flocked to his banner. Fulfilling his end of the bargain with the Sith, the New Mandalore command was simple; face the greatest challenge the galaxy has to offer and battle the Jedi Knights. Obviously the plan was to disrupt the Jedi war effort against the Sith.\n\nIn order to provoke the Jedi, the Mandalorians blockaded the Rimma Trade Route, cutting off supplies to and from the Outer Rim and hurting the war effort against the Sith Empire. Left with no choice, the Jedi were forced to attack the Mandalorian blockade in an attempt to break it. The attack was a total failure, the Jedi were soundly defeated and the Mandalorians continued their blockade. Were it not for the efforts of daring smugglers led by Hylo Visz, the Republic would have fallen much sooner. Visz gathered all the supply ships she could find, loaded them down, and parked them less than a parsec from the Mandalorian fleet. Distracted by the suspicion freighters, the Mandalorians were caught off guard by a joint Republic-smuggler attack, breaking the blockade.\n\nThe Jedi war effort was able to continue, Visz was hailed as a hero, and the Mandalorians disbanded, the new Mandalore leading some of their number to seek new challenges while the rest returned to mercenary work. Ultimately, the new Mandalore was assassinated and replaced, though the allegiance of the current Mandalore remains ambiguous.\n\nHowever, due to their delays in the Mid Rim, the Sith tactics became increasingly aggressive and desperate. The Sith Emperor became increasingly impatient, having expected to triumph quickly. In his impatience, he presented a surprising offer to the Republic; a peace treaty. The Jedi Council advised caution, but even they admitted that the war was unwinnable. Peace was the only option.\n\n[[File:SithInvasion-Deceived.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sith warriors storming the Jedi Temple.]]\n\nWhile diplomats and senators convened on Alderaan for negotiations with the Sith, the dark-siders played their final card. They attacked Coruscant. Using a stolen Republic ship, a group of Sith warriors crash-landed within the entrance to the Jedi Temple itself. Rendezvousing with [[Darth Malgus]], who had arrived just previously, and a Sith-hired bounty hunter who had disabled the Temple security system. Sacking the Temple, they disabled the Coruscant defense mainframe, allowing their forces to land and storm the planet.\n\nWith the Republic's capital firmly in their grip, the Imperial delegation took command of the Alderaan Peace Conference. Lord Baras introduced the Republic diplomats to the Treaty of Coruscant, an agreement greatly biased towards the Sith that would shape galactic events for decades. Although the Jedi Order's representatives protested, Senator Am-Ris agreed to the terms. The war was ended, but Coruscant was subjected to the rule of the Empire's Dark Council for a short time.\n\n[[File:TreatyofCoruscantborders.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The new galactic map after the Treaty of Coruscant]]\n\nWith the Sith takeover of Coruscant, the Empire now controlled half of the galaxy, and thanks to the Treaty of Coruscant, they were recognized as a legitimate government for the first time in their history. The Jedi and Republic troops were recalled from their many battles, leaving thousands of star systems to fend for themselves under Sith control. With the Jedi Temple on Coruscant ransacked and in ruins, the Jedi Order was forced to relocate, choosing their ancient homeworld of Tython. As the Sith Empire consolidated its power and the Galactic Republic licked its wounds, the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic\u2013Sith Empire)|Cold War]] began.\n\n===The Cold War===\n{{Quote|Thus began the unprecedented stalemate.

Border skirmishes and proxy wars between the two powers brought the uneasy truce to the brink of collapse. However, neither side was ready to resume all out war; and the Sith Emperor's interests seemed to turn to something other than conquest. He handed control of the Empire over to his Dark Council, which oversaw the day-to-day affairs of the regime, and went on to pursue his own mysterious goals.\n\nWhile the Cold War broiled, the Jedi Order reconnected with their roots, and for the most part secluded themselves from galactic affairs, as public opinion had largely turned against them and irate senators blamed them for the war.\n\nThe Cold War saw two powerful Sith Lords rise to power: [[Darth Nox]] and the second [[Empire's Wrath|Emperor's Wrath]].\n\n===Second Great Galactic War===\n{{Quote|We are at war! The Dark Council has placed me in charge and battles are being waged across the galaxy.|[[Darth Baras]]|<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Old Republic\" />}}\nThe Second Great Galactic War was the culmination of a dozen years' worth of intense standoffs, uneasy peace and minor border skirmishes and proxy wars. When the galaxy returned to full-scale war, both sides more powerful than they had been previously, the galaxy was torn apart by vicious battles and scheming plots. The Emperor consolidated his power from the shadows, his agents relaying information of galactic events to him while he prepared his plan to annihilate life in the galaxy and gain ultimate supremacy and power.\n\nThe Second Great Galactic War saw Darth Nox and the Emperor's Wrath lead Sith Forces into war, savagely attacking the Republic and battling ferociously with the Jedi. Though the Dark Lords of the Sith often engaged in mortal combat with the Jedi, they also suffered from internal betrayals and other schemes and plots against rivals. This intense rivalry and infighting was put to an end by the Emperor's Wrath, thus strengthening the Empire like never before. After the Emperor, [[Tenebrae|Vitiate]], was resurrected, he consumed all life on Ziost before fleeing into Wild Space. He secretly built up the [[Eternal Empire]], which invaded the galaxy and subjected the Sith Empire and Republic, until a war hero rose up, and with the help of the Sith [[Lana Beniko]] and Republic SIS agent Theron Shan, created the Eternal Alliance that toppled the Empire and slew Vitiate. The Sith Empire would later engage in the [[third Galactic War]] with the Republic.\n\n===Desolous's Insurgence===\n[[File:DarthDesolousface.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Desolous]]\nMore than one hundred years after the fall of the Eternal Empire and the third Galactic War, a [[Pau'an/Legends|Pau'an]] Force-sensitive was discovered by the Jedi. Brought into the order, he eventually became a revered and powerful Jedi Master. However, his innate lust for battle drove him to seek out Sith teachings, which forced the Jedi to expel him from the order.<ref name=\"TFU\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]''</ref>\n\nThe master declared himself Dark Lord of the Sith and took on the name [[Darth Desolous]]. Desolous returned home to [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]] and proceeded to build an army around him, training hundreds of fellow Pau'ans in a personalized version of Jedi fighting techniques and equipping them with Cortosis alloy shields. He then rallied his army and embarked on a bloody campaign against the Jedi Order. Using ambush and guerrilla fighting tactics, Desolous and his army ultimately slaughtered over two thousand Jedi.<ref name=\"TFU\" />\n\nHowever, with each victory, Desolous grew increasingly reckless and bold, his hatred of the Jedi eclipsing all other emotions, or reason. In his recklessness, Desolous allowed himself and his army to be drawn into a trap at [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]], where he and his army were destroyed.<ref name=\"TFU\" />\n\nIn [[2975 BBY]], the two surviving Sith factions on Kesh, the Lost Tribe of the Sith and the Doomed clashed in a conflict that culminated with the dissolution of the Doomed, and the reawakening and death of Dreypa.<ref name=\"Lost Tribe\" />\n\n===The New Sith Wars===\n====Ruin====\n{{Quote|There is nothing&hellip;<br />Only me.|From the creed of ruin|<ref name=\"EotJ\">{{DoD|Echoes of the Jedi}}</ref>}}\n[[File:DarthRuin-EGF.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Darth Ruin]]\nSeveral hundred years after the fall of Darth Desolous, another charismatic and revered Jedi Master fell to the Dark side and recreated the Sith. This time, it was the Umbaran Phanius, a renegade master known for a disturbing philosophy, which included elements of moral relativism and solipsism, possibly echoed in certain aspects by the much later Potentium belief.<ref name=\"JvS\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref>\n\nLeaving the Jedi Order to pursue prohibited Sith teachings, Phanius became the first of what would be known as the Lost Twenty. The newly christened [[Darth Ruin]] set about recreating the Sith, uniting the various splinter factions that remained from the Old Sith Wars and the Cold War, and gaining the allegiance of fifty turn-coat Jedi Knights in an event known as the [[Fourth Great Schism]]. Ruin proceeded to initiate the [[New Sith Wars]] against the Jedi.<ref name=\"JvS\" />\n\nHowever, his newfound power was not to last. Ruin, in his all-consuming ambition and single-minded hatred of the Jedi, caused the deaths of thousands of his own followers, sometimes on a whim. Ultimately, Ruin's actions led to the betrayal of his followers, and he was assassinated. However, the New Sith Wars continued on and off for almost a millennium.<ref name=\"JvS\" />\n\n====The Dark Underlord====\n[[File:Dark-underlord.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Dark Underlord]]\nFollowing the death of Darth Ruin, several Dark Lords rose to power and reorganized the Sith, renewing war against the Republic. One of the first after Ruin was a mysterious being known only as the [[Dark Underlord]]. Theories regarding his true identity often gravitated towards him being a Sith spirit summoned from Chaos, some even stating that he was the resurrection of the Lettow General [[Xendor]].<ref name=\"END\" />\n\nDuring the first quarter of the war, the Underlord was a bloody marauder who earned the ire of the Republic. Attaining leadership of the Sith, the Underlord consolidated a number of elite Sith warriors known as the Black Knights. Setting up a base on Malrev IV, they continued the war against the Republic.<ref name=\"END\" />\n\nAs the Dark Underlord fought the Republic, he found a nemesis in the Jedi General [[Murrtaggh]]. The Jedi General, in a scheme to infiltrate the Underlord's fortress on Malrev IV, hired a group of Mandalorian mercenaries to stage a diversionary attack while he broke into the fortress and assassinated the Underlord. Murrtaggh's plan was ultimately successful, but at a terrible price. He confronted the Underlord and slew him, but fell to the Dark side as he struck down the Dark Lord.<ref name=\"END\" />\n\n====Rivan====\n{{Quote|Darkness is a friend, an ally.

It allows us to be honest with ourselves, to express those values that we would disavow in the light. The light blinds us. It is only in the dark that we see clearly, and there is a great dark hidden among these worlds.|Darth Rivan|<ref name=\"END\" />}}\n[[File:Darthriv.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Darth Rivan]]\nSometime after the fall of the Dark Underlord, a Zelosian Sith Lord christened [[Darth Rivan]] rose to power. Rivan settled on the planet [[Almas]], and built a fortress on the world. However, unlike many of his predecessors who devoted themselves to war against the Republic, Rivan's primary occupation was study. His goal was to find a way to eliminate the inherent infighting amongst the Sith, as enlightened cooperation was not considered a virtue amongst Darksiders.\n\nRivan's researches turned his fortress into a massive focal point of Dark side energy, and resulted in the creation of the [[Sith battlelord]]s. The battlelords successfully implemented Rivan's goal of eliminating infighting by causing a Force-bond to form between a commander and all of his subordinates, ensuring that whenever a subordinate attempted to assassinate his superior officer, the damage would instead be inflicted upon the soldier.<ref name=\"battlelords\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050901sithbattlelords|text=Sith Battlelords}}</ref>\n\nRivan's other researches resulted in the creation of the [[Kaluthin]] grass, which modified the toxic landscape and atmosphere of Almas, terraforming the planet into a gardenlike paradise. At some point, he also gained possession of an artifact known as the [[Darkstaff]], an insidious semi-sentient weapon capable of draining the Force essence from living beings.<ref name=\"DSt\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030807darkstaff|text=The Darkstaff}}</ref>\n\nIt was initially believed that Rivan was betrayed and killed by his own apprentice, [[Darsin]], after being driven off Almas by a joint Republic/Jedi assault. In truth, the Darkstaff created a massive [[Force storm (wormhole)|Force storm]] that swept across the surface of Almas and transported Rivan through space and time to [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]] during the final battle of the New Sith Wars several centuries later. He perished in the battle, being left extremely weakened by the journey.<ref name=\"EotJ\" />\n\nUntil the rise of Darth Bane in the very same battle that resulted in his death, he was the last Sith Lord known to use the \"Darth\" title.\n\n====Darzu====\n{{Quote|She was a student of Sith alchemy; it was said she learned the secrets of mechu-deru, the ability to transform the flesh of living beings into metal and machinery.|[[Hetton]] to [[Darth Zannah/Legends|Darth Zannah]]|<ref name=\"RoT\" />}}\n[[File:Beliadarzu.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Belia Darzu, Dark Lord of the Sith]]\nSome time after Rivan's fall, a new Dark Lord known as [[Belia Darzu]] rose to power. Prior to her ascendance, the [[Shi'ido]] Darzu was a Dark Side Marauder and a Sith Alchemist. As Dark Lord, Darzu made the ancient Jedi world of Tython her seat of power, building a fortress and the planet and commencing with her alchemic experimentations, saturating the world with the Dark Side.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nAmong her creations was a suit of [[Belia Darzu's dark armor|heavy battle armor]] that was imbued with the Dark Side, granting the wearer invisibility and enhanced physical strength. However, possibly Darzu's most insidious creation was her personal army of [[Technobeast]]s, creatures whom she had mutated into twisted mechanical versions of their former selves through a combination of [[Nanovirus|Nanogene]] technology and the Dark side of the Force. She controlled this army through the use of the Sith alchemic technique ''[[Mechu-deru]]''.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nBelia Darzu was ultimately [[Assassination of Belia Darzu|assassinated]] by Sith of the [[Mecrosa Order]], who had her poisoned at the behest of her fellow Sith Lords. Though she died, her knowledge survived in the form of her many notes and journals left intact within her fortress, and her holocron, all of which later came into the possession of Darth Bane.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\n===Brotherhood of Darkness===\n[[File:Kaan.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Lord Kaan]]\nDue to the constant infighting amongst the Sith, their Empire was fractured into numerous pieces. Self-proclaimed Sith Lords rose to establish their own personal domains, while enslaved masses suffered under the rule of these warlords. Despite this division however, the Republic and the Jedi Order were both too weakened by their off-and-on conflicts with the Sith for them to capitalize on it. With the Republic crumbling due simply to a lack of infrastructure, the Mid and Outer Rims became lawless free-fire zones that, more often than not, were absorbed into the territories of various Sith warlords. In response to the lack of Republic and Jedi intervention against the Sith, many individual Jedi began personal campaigns to free oppressed worlds from the Sith. In the instances where they succeeded, they were often granted Feudal-styled control over the area they freed by their grateful populaces. These [[Jedi Lord]]s eventually became so popular and powerful that they created their own [[Jedi Grand Council|council]] to oversee their affairs, completely ignoring the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]]. In an attempt to regain their authority and popularity, the High Council fielded their own champion, the charismatic and powerful [[Skere Kaan]]. However, Kaan believed that the Jedi were responsible for the chaos that plagued the galaxy, and defected with a group of like-minded Jedi to the Sith cause. However, unlike his fellows who were more concerned with establishing personal dominance, Kaan focused on bringing down the ailing Republic. To this end, he set about uniting the various factions of the Empire under a single banner.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nKaan's plan to unite the Empire was unique in Sith history. Rather than individually challenge each of the Dark Lords to gain possession of their forces, Kaan instead acquiesced to their vanity, naming them all Dark Lords of the Sith and declaring them equal within the Empire. Advocating cooperation and unity within the Sith, Kaan ended the age-old power struggle and gained the backing of all the Dark Lords, who swore loyalty to him.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nThanks to Kaan's efforts, the Sith Empire was reorganized into the [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]], and in a political sense, was now more united and stronger than before. Under Kaan's leadership, the Brotherhood set about destroying the Republic, securing the galaxy for the Sith.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n====Sith Campaigns====\n{{Quote|This victory sends a message to the Republic and the Jedi. Now they will truly know and fear the Brotherhood.|Kaan|<ref name=\"PoD\" />}}\nNow united under a single banner and with a common goal in mind, the Sith onslaught was vicious and inexorable. Gaining a startling victory at Korriban, the Sith reclaimed the Sith tombworld and reopened the Sith academy. Kaan installed several of his lieutenants as the leaders, with Lord [[Qordis]] serving as headmaster.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nSoon after, Kaan moved on to his next target; [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]]. This world was largely insignificant save for its strategic placement. Kaan planned on using Ruusan as the staging area for the Sith invasion of the Core worlds. The first battle of Ruusan was a total Sith victory, with the Republic forces routed and annihilated thanks to Kaan's battle meditation. As they prepared to launch their invasion, Kaan easily repelled the Republic counter-attack.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nHowever, in the subsequent battles of the war, Kaan noticed a disturbing absence of Jedi. This absence was explained when Ruusan was suddenly attacked by the Jedi [[Army of Light/Legends|Army of Light]], led by [[Hoth (Jedi Lord)|Lord Hoth]]. The Sith forces were driven off-planet, though Kaan quickly moved to retake the world. Thus began the protracted Ruusan campaign.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nDuring this series of battles, both the Jedi and the Sith began to unravel, members of both groups beginning to lose faith in their leaders. It was into this hostile climate that [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]] emerged.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n===The Rise of Darth Bane===\n====Bane's emergence====\n[[File:DarthBane-TEA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Darth Bane]]\nThe man who would eventually become Darth Bane was born on the Republic mining world of [[Apatros/Legends|Apatros]]. Dessel was born to an abusive father and cortosis miner named [[Hurst]]. Bullied by his father and the other miners, Dessel became a highly aggressive though cunning individual, fighting back until they left him alone. Known by the derogatory nickname \"Bane\", given by his father to the \"bane of his existence\", Dessel eventually learned to ignore the jibes and insults directed at him by the other miners.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nHowever, Dessel was challenged to a fight one day by one of his now dead father's friends; Gerd; Dessel bit off the drunken miners thumb. Suspended from work, Dessel went to the local cantina a little earlier than usual, beating the crowds. There, he got into a game of Sabacc with a group of off-duty Republic officers. Offended by his casually veiled insults, and enraged that Dessel won, they attacked him as he left. Dessel killed one of them in the ensuing fight.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nKnowing that the Republic officials would imprison him for killing the officer even though he was the aggressor, Dessel fled the planet and joined the Sith army. Rising to the rank of Sergeant in the Gloom Walkers unit, Dessel's skill as a soldier, along with his unconscious use of the Force, caused the unit to become one of the most famous in the military. However, during the Battle of Phaseera, the unit was sent on a suicide mission. The unit's [[Commander/Legends|CO]], Ulabore, was too terrified of the Sith Lords to consider questioning the order, so Dessel incapacitated him and took command.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nThough the mission was successful, Ulabore had Dessel taken to be court-martialed. However, he was intercepted by the Sith Lord [[Kopecz]], who had him sent to the Sith academy on Korriban instead. Presented with an offer to join the ranks of the Dark Lords, Dessel accepted. As a sign that he had cast off his old identity, Dessel took on the derogatory nickname his father had for him, becoming Bane.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n====Training on Korriban====\n[[File:DarthBane.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bane]]\nBane immediately began his training under the masters of the academy. On his own initiative, he studied the academy archives for ancient lore, something discouraged by the current masters, who emphasized their difference rather than attempted to continue the old ways. Eventually, Bane began to abandon his studies in the archives to focus on physical and mental exercises. Challenging one of his fellow students; [[Fohargh]]; to a sparring bout, Bane was beaten, though he killed his opponent with the Force in a blind rage.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nHowever, his killing of Fohargh caused him to think back on the death of his father, and Bane suddenly realized that he had unconsciously killed his father. This revelation caused him to doubt his ability, and Bane began losing his connection to the Dark Side. This caused his progress to slip, and after a disastrous failure in a sparring match, Bane was denied the right to train with the other students.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nAs he could no longer attend classes, Bane resumed his studies in the archives. As he learned of the ancient Sith and their ways, Bane began to question the edicts of the Brotherhood of Darkness. However, he continued to despair in his own abilities, and it was only the intervention of [[Githany]] that kicked him out of his stupor.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nGithany was a Jedi deserter who had provided the Sith with intelligence on the Jedi movements in exchange for membership. Taking her place at the academy, her Jedi training provided her with an edge over the other students, and she became one of the foremost apprentices. A primary obstacle towards her advancement, however, was [[Sirak]]. Sirak was the top student at the academy, and the only individual skilled enough to cause her worry.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nGithany saw the opportunity to destroy Sirak in Bane, and approached him. The two formed an alliance, and Githany began providing Bane with the training he was forced to miss out on, helping Bane regain his connection to the Dark side, though he continued to play the weakling to keep Sirak's guard down. While receiving training in Force techniques from Githany, Bane also met with the Academy swordmaster; [[Kas'im]]; receiving lightsaber instruction from him. Thanks to the efforts of these two teachers, whom Bane kept secret from one another, he gained sufficient power and skill to challenge Sirak. The bout was an unprecedented victory for Bane, and Sirak suffered his first defeat. However, Bane allowed Sirak to live, shaking Githany's and Kas'im's faith in him.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nDespite this, Bane was now the top student at the academy.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n====Rebellion====\nAfter his bout with Sirak, Bane was approached by Lord Qordis. The headmaster revealed that he had been aware of the secret training Bane received from Ka'sim and Githany for some time, and saluted Bane's progress. However, he also ordered Bane to cease studying the Sith archives, citing the Brotherhood's efforts to \"seek a new path\" rather than continue the old ways.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nEnraged by this, Bane traveled to Valley of the Sith Lords and began inspecting the tombs, looking for some way to prove Qordis wrong and validate the old ways. Finding nothing, he determined that the current Sith were too weak to deserve the wisdom of the ancients, and the old Sith spirits had abandoned them. Returning to the academy, he was ambushed by a vengeful Sirak, along with Sirak's two lackeys, and Githany. However, Githany changed allegiances halfway through the fight, aiding Bane in killing Sirak.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nShortly afterwards, the academy received word of the disastrous Ruusan campaign. As the Sith forces were in dire need of reinforcements, all the students immediately graduated and granted the rank of Dark Lord. However, Bane refused to accompany his fellow students, abandoning his mentors and rebelling against the Brotherhood.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nAs a sign of his difference, Bane claimed the forbidden and defunct title of ''Darth''. Darth Bane proceeded to steal Lord Qordis's ship and left Korriban.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n====The Holocron of Darth Revan====\n[[File:Unkwldtemple.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Temple of the Ancients on Lehon]]\nFollowing coordinates he discovered in the Korriban archives, Darth Bane traveled to the Unknown Regions, to Lehon. Landing on the Unknown World, Bane dominated a Rancor beast through Force persuasion, travelling to the Rakatan [[Temple of the Ancients]]. Entering, Bane began combing the structure for relics and artifacts. Eventually, his search led him to the sublevels. There he discovered a secret compartment in the central chamber containing the [[Darth Revan's Sith Holocron|holocron of Darth Revan]].<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nOpening the device, Bane was given access to a plethora of information on the ancient Sith and their abilities. Bane managed to create a personal library of handwritten records of the information before the holocrons power cell depleted, receiving a final message from Darth Revan. Using Revan's knowledge and teachings as inspiration, Bane came to believe that the Force, specifically the Dark Side, was finite, and that the Brotherhood of Darkness, in addition to disregarding traditional Sith beliefs, was spreading the Dark Side too thinly. Bane became determined to destroy the Brotherhood and reform the Sith, in accordance with his own philosophy; the Rule of Two. This new edict reduced Sith numbers to merely two individuals; the master and the apprentice. To ensure a line of secession, the apprentice would eventually assassinate and replace the master after learning all he could, before taking an apprentice of his own, continuing the Sith.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nWhile Bane made his revelations, the Brotherhood of Darkness was worried by his absence from their ranks, as he had been one of their most powerful members. Kaan, fearful of Bane's intentions after Githany told him of a vision she experienced, dispatched Kas'im to Lehon with an ultimatum, \"join us or die\".<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nKas'im followed the homing beacon in Bane's ship, which Bane had not bothered to deactivate, finding the \"wayward\" Dark Lord's landing site. Confronting Bane in the Temple of the Ancients, the two had a brief, heated discussion, which ended in conflict. In the ensuing lightsaber duel, Kas'im almost managed to defeat Bane with his knowledge of [[Jar'Kai/Legends|dual-saber combat]], which Bane had not received training in. However, in the end, Bane prevailed, demolishing the Temple of the Ancients with a massive Force blast while Kas'im was still inside.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nUsing Kas'im's death as the excuse, Bane began playing the weakling again, using this facade to deceive the Brotherhood into believing that he was ready to rejoin them, sending some of his records from Revan's holocron as proof of his sincerity. Meeting with Githany on Ambria, Bane was almost killed by her, being poisoned by a sample of the toxin synox Githany covered her lips with when they shared a kiss. Too weakened to heal himself, Bane rushed across the Ambrian desert to the hut of the healer; Caleb. Taking Caleb's daughter hostage, Bane forced the man to treat him. Cured by the healer, Bane allowed him to live, feeling that he could be a useful contact in the future.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nWith that, Bane departed for Ruusan.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n====Destruction of the Brotherhood of Darkness====\n[[File:DarthBanelightning.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Darth Bane leading the Dark Side ritual during the sixth battle of Ruusan]]\nArriving on Ruusan during the aftermath of the [[Fifth Battle of Ruusan|fifth battle of the campaign]], Darth Bane stormed in on the Dark Lords during a strategic briefing. Disgusted by Kaan's mindset, Bane accused him of thinking like a ''dirt general'' rather than a proper Sith Lord. Kaan decided to accept Bane's tactical advise, and the Dark Lords gathered together in a ritual led by Bane, unleashing a Dark Side fueled wave of destruction upon the Jedi forces.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nWhile the attack itself was a total success, the Dark Lords sensed Darth Bane's intention, and broke the ritual, attacking the Jedi personally while their forces were in disarray. Bane, though enraged by their initiative, took advantage of the situation to thin their number. While the Dark Lords led the assault, Bane went to Kaan's tent and used his communication equipment to order the Sith fleet to attack the Jedi fleet, breaking the Sith blockade and allowing the Jedi to send reinforcements. The Sith were unexpectedly attacked and forced to flee. Before the Sith arrived back at camp, Bane was approached by Qordis, who sought to join Bane. Bane flatly refused and killed Qordis.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nConfronted by Kaan, Bane pretended to be dominated by Kaan's Force persuasion, and manipulated Kaan into preparing the Thought Bomb. The Thought Bomb was an ancient Sith weapon of terrible power, a massive focus of Dark Side energy that when detonated would cause mass devastation across a wide area, and kill any powerful Force-sensitives in the area. However, Kaan was unaware that the weapon would also kill the creators, namely the Sith Lords of the Brotherhood.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n[[File:Bouncersandthethoughtbomb.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Thought Bomb in the aftermath of the Seventh battle of Ruusan]]\n\nThe Sith forces and the Dark Lords all retreated to a massive network of caves and gathered in the central chamber. Kaan, using Bane's records, led the ritual, creating the Thought Bomb. When confronted by a group of Jedi led by Lord Hoth, Kaan detonated the bomb.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\nThe Brotherhood of Darkness was destroyed.<ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n===Rule of Two===\n====Darth Bane's reign====\n=====Early Actions=====\nOne of Bane's first actions in the aftermath of Ruusan was to search out an apprentice. He found his disciple in the form of the young girl [[Darth Zannah/Legends|Zannah]]. After terrorizing a group of surviving Sith mercenaries to create easily discredited rumors of a surviving Dark Lord, allowing the Sith to remain hidden, he tasked Zannah with finding a way to Onderon, on her own, as a test. Abandoning her on the Ruusan battlefield, Bane departed for the planet himself.<ref name=\"RoT\" /><ref name=\"PoD\" />\n\n[[File:Gamer-3-bane.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Darth Bane's body is colonized by the orbalisks while he retrieves Freedon Nadd's holocron.]]\n\nHowever, along the way, he was suddenly accosted by the spirits of Qordis and Kaan, both of whom had somehow found a way to escape the Thought Bomb. Provoked by them, Bane accidentally crippled his ship and crash-landed on the Onderonian moon; Dxun. Wandering through the wilderness, Bane came upon the Tomb of Freedon Nadd. Investigating it, he managed to gain entry, procuring Nadd's holocron. However, before he could exit the tomb, he was attacked by a swarm of orbalisks that had colonized the tomb. They latched themselves to his body, but instead of parasitically feeding on it, they instead fed upon his Dark Side energy. The two formed a symbiotic relationship, the orbalisks got to feast on Bane's energy, sustaining themselves, while they formed a set of nigh-impervious bio-organic armor for him, and they served as repositories of Dark Side energy that he could draw on at will.<ref name=\"RoT\" /><ref name=\"BotS\">{{GamerCite|3|Bane of the Sith}}</ref>\n\nUsing their power, he dominated one of the Dxun beasts to serve as his steed. Thanks to virtue of season, Bane had arrived on Dxun during the period where the atmospheres of the moon and Onderon overlapped. Pushing his steed to the limit, Bane made for Onderon.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nWhile Bane fought through his ordeal on Dxun, Zannah made her way to Onderon by hijacking a Republic vessel and killing the crew with a stolen blaster. Crash-landing on Onderon, she was ambushed by a clan of beast-riders. Before they could kill her, Darth Bane arrived. The beast-riders were slaughtered. Bane was impressed by Zannah's ability, and officially made her his apprentice.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\n=====Zannah's apprenticeship=====\n[[File:DarthZannah-DoE.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Bane and his apprentice, Darth Zannah]]\nDarth Bane and Zannah settled on Ambia on the shores of [[Lake Natth]], a focus of Dark Side energy on the planet. Over the next decade, Bane trained Zannah in the arts of patience, secrecy and deception. Zannah herself developed a talent for Sith sorcery, becoming a skilled illusionist. Bane's abilities as a duelist also rubbed off on Zannah, and she developed into a formidable combatant in her own right.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nWhile he trained Darth Zannah, Bane utilized records stolen from the Brotherhood of Darkness to gain access to Lord Qordis's bank accounts, making off with the late Sith Lord's considerable funds. Using these credits, Bane began manipulating galactic politics, working through a variety of intermediates and middle-men. Bane began stirring up a variety of anti-Republic terrorist organizations, in order to distract the Jedi from investigating Sith rumors and keep the Republic united, ensuring that the Sith only had a single target to focus on, and to set the stage for the eventual Sith takeover.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nBane also dispatched Zannah to infiltrate the Anti Republic Liberation Front, one of the more prominent terrorist groups, based on Serenno. Zannah's mission was successful, and she brought about the group's destruction. However, she also gained the attention of the group's reclusive leader; [[Hetton]]. Hetton was a Serenno nobleman and self-taught Sith acolyte. When he discovered Zannah's identity as a Sith Lord, he immediately begged her to make him her apprentice.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nZannah seemingly agreed, and took Hetton and his entourage of Sith assassins to Ambria, supposedly to assassinate Darth Bane. Bane easily held off the attack, and killed Hetton. Zannah then revealed to Bane that the assassination attempt was a manipulation to eliminate Hetton and test Bane, and that the ultimate goal had been gaining the possession of Hetton's collection of Sith artifacts.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nWhile they gained a massive number of Sith equipment, Bane was still unsatisfied. He had been seeking to create a holocron, but had been repeatedly undone supposedly by the effects of the orbalisks, who enhanced his rage but inhibited his concentration. Bane dispatched Zannah to infiltrate the Jedi temple and gain access to the archives, so he might find a way to remove the orbalisks. While Zannah did this, Bane departed for Tython to search out Belia Darzu's fortress, and her holocron.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\n=====Near Disaster on Tython=====\nDarth Bane landed on Tython and successfully infiltrated the fortress of Belia Darzu, evading the still active defenses. Making his way to the central chamber, he fought his way through her hordes of remaining technobeasts and retrieved her holocron. Studying the artifact, he discovered that his failure at creating a holocron had been due to design flaws on his part, rather than the orbalisks hindering his efforts. While Zannah sought out information on orbalisks in the Jedi archives, Bane began to rethink his decision to remove them.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\n[[File:Tomcatgoesdark.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Darovit defecting to the Sith during the war]]\n\nWhile Zannah successfully found the information she was looking for, she also encountered her cousin; [[Darovit]]. As children, Zannah and Darovit had been recruited by the Jedi to help in the Ruusan campaign. However, their ship was shot down as they came in to land, and the two were separated. Darovit had been found by the Jedi, though he shortly afterwards defected to the Sith, while Zannah had wandered the wilderness for several days before being found by Bane. In the aftermath of Ruusan, Darovit became the Healing Hermit, devoting himself to helping Ruusan recover from the war as a penance for his own actions.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nWhen a Republic construction team led by Johun Othone arrived on Ruusan to construct a [[Valley of the Jedi|memorial to the battle]], Darovit was enraged, seeing this action as opening an old wound. Sabotaging their efforts, Darovit gained the attention of Othone, who pursued him back to his dwelling. Knowing that the game was up, Darovit surrendered. As the two spoke, Darovit revealed the survival of the Sith. After the battle of Ruusan, Darovit had encountered Bane and Zannah after the Thought Bombs detonation before they left. Zannah, as a final act of mercy, used the Force to destroy Darovit's right hand, disarming him, but indirectly sparing his life, as Bane no longer saw him as a threat. Bane allowed him to live, feeling that no one would believe the word of a traitor if Darovit tried reporting the Sith Lord's existence.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nOthone brought Darovit to the Jedi Temple to testify before the Jedi Council. However, while Othone set up an appointment with the Council, Darovit encountered Zannah in the archives while researching herbal lore. Zannah, having found the information she needed, abducted him and fled the planet. However, Darovit's absence was immediately noticed, and Othone managed to convince several Masters to accompany him in pursuit of Zannah. However, they had no time to inform any others of Darth Bane's survival.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nZannah met Bane on Tython, with Darovit in tow. Convincing Bane to allow Darovit to live, as his abilities as a healer could aid them in removing the orbalisks, they prepared to confront the Jedi. Retreating to a large chamber deep in Belia Darzu's fortress, they stashed their artifacts and information in a small side room, along with Darovit, and prepared to meet the Jedi.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\n[[File:DarthBane-NEGTC.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Bane in his orbalisk armor]]\n\n[[Valenthyne Farfalla]] and [[Raskta Lsu]] took Bane, and Othone and [[Sarro Xaj]] attacked Zannah, while Master [[Worror Dowmat]] held back and reinforced them with Battle Meditation. Despite Dowmat's aid, the Jedi were unable to bring down the Dark Lords, Bane's orbalisk armor protecting him from their lightsaber strikes, enabling him to focus solely on offense, while Zannah's [[Form III/Legends|defensive technique]] proved adequate to hold off Xaj, whose efforts were being hindered by Othone's rusty skills. However, when Othone broke off to attack Bane, Xaj was able to take full advantage of his skills, gaining ground on Zannah.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nBane, attempting to halt the Jedi's advance, attacked Dowmat. While Farfalla managed to save Dowmat from Bane, he also disrupted his Battle Meditation, distracting the Jedi and allowing Zannah to slay Xaj. Freed up to help Bane, Zannah impaled Lsu while Bane decapitated Farfalla and gouged out Dowmat's throats. As Bane prepared to execute Othone with a blast of Force lightning, Worror used the last of his strength to encase the Dark Lord in a [[Protection bubble|Force shield]], causing the lightning to backfire upon Bane.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nThis revealed a major weakness in the orbalisks; they were unable to withstand electrical bursts, and were killed by the lightning. As they died, they released a toxic excretion into Bane's body that would leave him dead within days unless treated. Finishing Othone herself, Zannah quickly loaded Bane's dying body onto their ship, along with Darovit and their gathered artifacts and information and rushed to Ambria.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nMeeting with the healer, Caleb, whom Bane had earlier relied on when Githany had poisoned him, Zannah attempted to extort him. However, Caleb was unconcerned with any of Zannah's threats, as his daughter was all that mattered to him, and he had already sent her away. While Zannah despaired, Darovit convinced Caleb to heal Bane, on the condition that Zannah allow them to send a message to the Jedi informing them of Bane's existence, his location, and his helpless state. While Darovit hoped the Jedi would take Zannah and Bane into custody, and allow Zannah to redeem herself, the Sith apprentice had other ideas.<ref name=\"RoT\" />\n\nAllowing them to send the message, which was written and delivered by message drone, Zannah waited until they healed Bane and then struck. Zannah [[Dismemberment/Legends|dismembered]] Caleb and used her abilities to drive Darovit insane before hiding herself and Bane. The Jedi arrived soon after and found Caleb's remains. Attacked by the maddened Darovit, they quickly brought him down. Assuming Darovit to be the Dark Lord, they believed that he had brought down the masters on Tython single-handedly, but was wounded, and his attempts to heal himself through the Dark Side backfired. They believed that Caleb had been killed by \"Bane\" when he sought treatment and discovered that Caleb had sent the message to the Jedi. Collecting Caleb's remains for burial, the Jedi departed, satisfied that the Sith were finally defeated, and glorified the encounter as the \"Fall of Darth Bane\".<ref name=\"RoT\" /><ref name=\"RotSn\">[[Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'' novelization]]</ref>\n\n=====Later Actions=====\n[[File:DarthZannah-DoE.png|thumb|right|120px|Darth Zannah during the latter stage of her apprenticeship]]\nBane's efforts to construct a holocron would eventually come to fruition, this artifact eventually finding its way into the possession of [[Darth Krayt]], though it would be of little use to him.<ref name=\"LB4\">[[Legacy (2006) 5|''Legacy'' (2006) 5]]</ref>\n\nHowever, as ten years passed, Zannah failed to make an attempt on Bane's life, and the Dark Lord began to become concerned with her worthiness. Worried that she might be unable to succeed him, Bane set about searching for the long lost [[Holocron of Heresies|holocron]] of [[Darth Andeddu]], and the means for achieving immortality.<ref name=\"DoE\">''[[Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, when Bane gained the holocron and studied its immortal ways, it was stolen by [[Set Harth]], who was once the apprentice of Zannah while trying to help her kill Bane. Bane then took an [[Iktotchi/Legends|Iktotchi]] [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] dubbed [[Darth Cognus]], but destroyed his own body from what he had read from Andeddu's holocron and seemingly himself in Zannah's body. Cognus then apprenticed herself to Darth Zannah, who was now the official Dark Lord of the Sith. Eventually, Cognus would rise to take her mistress' place and the rank of Sith Master.<ref name=\"DoE\" />\n\n====Darth Cognus's reign====\nDarth Cognus was a member of the Sith Order who attained power from her mentor, Zannah. As Sith Master, she took as her apprentice an individual named [[Darth Millennial|Millennial]], a three-eyed mutant human and a powerful Force-sensitive.<ref name=\"END\" />\n\n=====Millennial's Rebellion=====\n[[File:Darthcog.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Darth Cognus]]\nMillennial proved to be an able apprentice, trained as a [[Shadow Hand]] by Cognus and possessing powerful precognitive abilities. However, Millennial and Cognus disagreed on several points, most notably on the continued application of the Rule of Two.<ref name=\"END\" />\n\nCognus was a staunch believer in the philosophy, training Millennial accordingly. The mutant apprentice, on the other hand, believed the doctrine to be too restrictive, instead supporting the more martial Rule of the Strong, which tolerated the presence of numerous Sith Lords, the leader being the strongest. The two clashed many times over this issue, and tensions eventually reached a boiling point.<ref name=\"END\" />\n\nCognus ended Millennial's training and cast him out. Whether this was a brutal execution attempt or a simple expulsion remains unknown, but either way, Millennial fled. While Cognus took a new apprentice and continued the Rule of Two, Millennial settled on [[Dromund Kaas/Legends|Dromund Kaas]] and founded the Sith splinter cult known as [[Dark Force]].<ref name=\"END\" />\n\n====Darth Vectivus's Reign====\nThe man who eventually became [[Darth Vectivus]] started out as a simple businessman, a shrewd but fair-minded individual. Taking control of a mining operation near [[Bimmiel/Legends|Bimmiel]], he discovered that he was a latent Force-sensitive, and began feeling Dark side energy permeating the mine. As he researched and learned from these energies, they also began adversely affecting the miners and contaminating the ore, forcing him to close the facility.<ref name=\"Betrayal\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]''</ref>\n\nAs he was now freed up without needing to manage his business operation, the man began journeying the galaxy seeking knowledge on the Force. He eventually came into contact with the Order of the Sith Lords, and was apprenticed. Becoming Darth Vectivus, he managed to keep control of himself, relying on his staunch ethical code to prevent becoming corrupted by the Dark Side. Becoming the Sith Master, Vectivus returned to the mine, building a mansion on the sight and living out his life happily surrounded by family and friends.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nVectivus remained an oddity among Sith, as he was not a power-hungry, rage driven schemer, but just an ordinary man.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\n====Darth Plagueis's Reign====\n[[File:Palpatineyouth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Darth Sidious trains under Darth Plagueis.]]\nThe Muun [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Plagueis]] reigned around the time of [[60 BBY/Legends|60 BBY]]. Born on [[Mygeeto/Legends|Mygeeto]] as Hego Damask, [[Darth Tenebrous/Legends|Darth Tenebrous]], known as Rugess Nome found him actually before he was born. Though it is also known that he was a mystic obsessed with immortality. Thanks to the longevity his species possessed, he spent over a lifetime searching for such secrets. They came in the form of the ability to manipulate the midi-chlorians within a being to prevent death, and create life, in the form of a spontaneously generated pregnancy.<ref name=\"JvS\" /><ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\n=====Sidious's Apprenticeship=====\nDarth Plagueis was eventually ambushed by a Bith who claimed Sith Lordship, calling himself Darth Venamis. Trained by Darth Tenebrous in violation of the Rule of Two, Venamis engaged Plagueis in a lightsaber duel and was defeated by the Muun Dark Lord. Having appropriated the Bith's available resources, Plagueis discovered a list of Force-sensitives whom Venamis was scouting as potential apprentices. He sought them out himself, and in the course of his search he took an interest in the teenage son of a nobleman on the planet Naboo, an intelligent but arrogant young human of extraordinary Force potential named Palpatine. Plagueis was superficially motivated by a desire to exploit Naboo's wealth of plasma, but in Palpatine he saw a far greater opportunity. After realizing the boy's Force-sensitivity and cultivating his interest in the dark side's power, Plagueis manipulated him into murdering his own family, thereby initiating him into the fold of the Sith. Darth Plagueis dubbed Palpatine Darth Sidious and began the youth's training in earnest. At last, the Muun Dark Lord had found a satisfactory implement for setting the Grand Plan of the Sith in motion: Palpatine was actively involved in politics already, being that public service is mandatory for Naboo youth, and as such, Darth Plagueis saw an opportunity to dismantle the Galactic Republic from within. The young Palpatine would slowly climb the political ladder until absolute power was eventually his, and all who stood in his way would be eliminated. The Grand Plan was now underway; nevertheless, the Muun never abandoned a pet project of his, an experiment in midi-chlorian manipulation engendered to preserve his reign indefinitely.\n\nAside from his own immortality, he also planned to create a pregnancy within a woman that would result in the most powerful Force-sensitive ever known. But unfortunately for Plagueis, Sidious suspected that his master was creating a replacement, the ultimate Sith apprentice. Many years later, having never lost sight of these suspicions, Sidious (now the newly elected Supreme Chancellor of the Republic) murdered Plagueis in his sleep, having plied his master with intoxicants on the pretext of celebrating his new chancellorship. After decades of learning from Darth Plagueis the Wise, the man who would become known as Palpatine the Great was now Dark Lord of the Sith.\n\n===Darth Sidious's Reign===\n====Maul's Apprenticeship====\n[[File:Maultraining.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Darth Maul training under Darth Sidious]]\nSometime during his young adulthood, while still apprenticed to Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious was given custody of an infant Zabrak named Maul by the baby's mother, a Nightsister of Dathomir who sought to spare her son the ordeal of his Nightbrother obligations. Sidious reluctantly took the infant into his charge, planning to train the child as an apprentice of his own. It was not altogether surprising; due to the martial prowess and Force sensitivity common to the Zabrak species, they were long a subject of interest to the Sith empires of old, these groups often spending ridiculous sums of money to hire Zabrak mercenaries. However, nothing could have prepared Maul for the brutal treatment he received from Sidious.<ref name=\"JvS\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\n\nMaul was subjected to numerous physical tests and training regiments, many of which bordered on torture. The goal of this vicious treatment was to strip Maul of his compassion and humility, turning him into a rage-fueled Sith killer. In the end, Sidious achieved his goal, and Maul became a powerful Sith Lord who demonstrated great martial prowess.<ref name=\"JvS\" />\n\nAs a final test, Sidious abandoned Maul on a remote and isolated world, where he was relentlessly hunted by his assassin droids. After leaving him to survive for a month, Sidious confronted the Zabrak and challenged him. Despite Maul's best efforts, he was defeated, and Sidious taunted that he had trained a new apprentice during the interim period, a replacement for Maul. The enraged Zabrak resumed fighting with renewed vigor, and even though he was defeated, he still passed Sidious's test.<ref name=\"DarthMaulJournal\">''[[Star Wars Journal: Darth Maul]]''</ref>\n\nDarth Sidious declared his apprentice's training complete and dubbed him Darth Maul, Dark Lord of the Sith. Though this could be construed as a violation of the Rule of Two, Darth Sidious had informed Darth Plagueis of Maul's impending lordship, and indeed, had trained the Zabrak with Plagueis's permission. Moreover, Maul was never trained as a true Sith Lord, but rather as a Sith assassin, used for assignments deemed too risky for Sidious to undertake himself, lest he endanger his political ascension. Despite his success with Maul's training, Sidious regarded him as little more than a placeholder for his [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|eventual target]].<ref name=\"JvS\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" /><ref name=\"DarthMaulJournal\" />\n\n====The Phantom Menace====\n[[File:Palpy30.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Senator [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]].]]\nWhile Sidious trained Maul, he also set about preparing for the ultimate revenge of the Sith. Using his alter ego; Palpatine; Sidious infiltrated the halls of power, starting as a relatively low-level politician on his native Naboo, and worked his way up. Sidious ensured that his rise was relatively slow, rather than an alarming meteoric rise to power that would attract his enemy's attention.\n\nIn [[52 BBY/Legends|52 BBY]], Palpatine had the current Chommell sector Senator; [[Vidar Kim]]; assassinated. His complicity in the killing was never discovered, as the assassin committed suicide while being interrogated by Kim's Jedi son; [[Ronhar Kim|Ronhar]]. In a demonstration of his cunning, Palpatine befriended Ronhar Kim during the late-Senator Kim's funeral, gaining a contact, and an unwitting pawn. Palpatine would use Ronhar Kim in a scheme that resulted in the creation of the Red Guard, and Kim's death during the Clone Wars would be used as propaganda to further Palpatine's power grab.<ref name=\"Republic64BLOODLINES\">[[Republic 64|''Republic'' 64]]</ref>\n\nWith Vidar Kim out of the way, Palpatine assumed his place in the Galactic Senate of the Republic. Many of the power-brokers and Coruscanti politicians looked down on provincial delegates like Palpatine, believing such hopefuls would be overwhelmed by the complexity and enormity of galactic politics. Palpatine encouraged this opinion, as it made him harder to notice, and thereby less threatening.\n\nHowever, Palpatine's quiet position gained him many friends within the Senate, and he became increasingly popular. He was also an avid writer, and many of Palpatine's publications and theories about political science were taught at leading universities. However, despite Palpatine's fame and popularity, he remained unassuming, devoting all his time to his work, and to furthering his Sith agenda.\n\nPart of the preparation for his ultimate rise was to engineer the assassination of the [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] directorate. Thanks to his contact and ally, [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]], the directorate was destroyed in a pirate raid on Eriadu, where they had gathered for a summit. This allowed for the Neimodians to take advantage of the situation and take over the Federation. The new leader of the corporation was the Viceroy; [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]].\n\nOnce this was done, Palpatine supported the Senate resolution BR-0371, which caused many of the Galactic trade routes to have taxes levied on them. The Trade Federation was outraged, and was approached by Darth Sidious in short order. Sidious encouraged the Neimodians to retaliate, having them blockade Naboo in protest.\n\n=====The Naboo Crisis=====\n{{Quote|At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.|[[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]]|audio=RevengeAtLast-TPM.flac|<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />}}\nAll the pieces were now in place; Palpatine heavily influenced both the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic; [[Finis Valorum/Legends|Finis Valorum]]; and the current monarch of Naboo; [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], and Sidious had direct control over the timid leaders of the Trade Federation. Everything that transpired did so according to his design.\nThe Blockade of Naboo kick-started uproar in the Senate, but as the Trade Federation had broken no laws, the Judicial department could not act. The Senate's stalling weakened Valorum's hold on power. However, surprisingly, Palpatine was unable to completely rein in Amidala as he had expected, and she contacted Valorum directly, holding him personally responsible for the crisis.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />\n\nValorum panicked, backed into a corner by his own morality and desperate to shore up support, he contacted the Jedi Council. The Council sent Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice; [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]; to Naboo as ambassadors to resolve the issue. The Jedi landed aboard the Trade Federation flagship in orbit above Naboo and waited to meet with Gunray and his aides. Darth Sidious was enraged by this new development, ordering them to proceed with the invasion and have the Jedi killed, as the Neimoidians could simply deny the Jedi's presence. However, Jinn and Kenobi managed to escape the dioxis-flooded conference room. Fighting their way to the bridge entrance, they attempted to force their way in, but were driven off by the Trade Federation Destroyer Droids. The Jedi managed to escape the ship aboard the Trade Federation invasion craft.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />\n\n[[File:EncounterintheDesert.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]] confronts [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].]]\n\nWhile the invasion itself proceeded splendidly, the Jedi managed to make contact with Amidala and her entourage, spiriting them off-planet. However, as they escaped, their ship was damaged, and they were forced to detour to Tatooine to make repairs. Sidious was truly alarmed by this, sending Maul to Tatooine to retrieve the Queen, and also to prevent the Jedi from interfering with his potential replacement; [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]. However, despite Maul's efforts, he was unsuccessful, Amidala and the Jedi managed to escape Tatooine, taking Anakin Skywalker with them.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />\n\nThe continued existence of the Sith, and their involvement in the crisis, was revealed.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />\n\nThe Jedi and the Queen managed to make it to Coruscant, where Amidala met with the Senate, while Anakin Skywalker was taken before the Jedi Council. Palpatine manipulated Amidala into calling for a vote of No-Confidence in Chancellor Valorum, bringing about a Senate election. In accordance with his plan, Palpatine used the blockade of Naboo to take advantage of the sympathy vote, backing up his own popularity. While Palpatine went about his political machinations, the Jedi debated over whether or not to accept the incredibly potent but drastically over-aged Anakin Skywalker for training, a heated issue that added to the tension caused by the revelation of the Sith's continued existence. Ultimately, the issue was stalled when Queen Amidala rashly decided to return to Naboo in an attempt to wrest control back from the Trade Federation. Jinn and Kenobi were sent to accompany her, with Skywalker in tow.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />\n\n====The Battle of Naboo====\nWhen Amidala arrived on Naboo, she used the Gungan exile [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]] who had joined her entourage before they fled the planet to make contact with the Gungan leadership. Making amends with the Gungans, whom the humans on Naboo had been tense with for centuries, she convinced them to mobilize their army to attack the Trade Federation droid forces. While the Battle of Naboo commenced, Amidala and the Jedi led a strike team into the Naboo capital to abduct Viceroy Gunray, and dispatch Naboo's air force to attack the Trade Federation flagship in orbit, as it controlled the droid armies that made up the corporations entire force.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />\n\n[[File:Maulhalved-tpm4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Darth Maul's defeat at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi]]\n\nHowever, as the team prepared to exit the hangar after rallying the air force, they were confronted by Darth Maul. As the Jedi broke off to take the Sith Lord, the team took an alternate exit. As this all took place, Anakin Skywalker took refuge in the cockpit of one of the Naboo fighters, accidentally activating the autopilot and going off to join the space battle.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />\n\nIt seemed that the Trade Federation and the Sith were going to be victorious in the struggle; Amidala was captured and taken before Gunray, the Gungan forces were routed and captured, the Naboo air force suffered heavy casualties, and Maul managed to kill Qui-Gon Jinn. Obi-Wan Kenobi fell on the Sith Lord in a blind fury, but was ultimately brought down by him, though not killed. However, Amidala managed to gain access to a hidden weapons cache in the throne room, taking Gunray hostage, Anakin Skywalker managed to land within the Trade Federation flagship, destroying the reactor before escaping, and Kenobi managed to get hold of Jinn's lightsaber and use it to defeat Maul with a timely sai tok maneuver, bisecting the Sith lord at the waist.<ref name=\"EpisodeI\" />\n\nUltimately, none of these events proved to be setbacks; Palpatine's ultimate goal of gaining the Chancellorship was achieved. Even Maul's apparent death was of little importance; Sidious sent him to Naboo with full knowledge of his eventual fate, thanks to his own precognitive powers. Maul had been a capable apprentice, but he had outlived his usefulness and was ill-suited to the coming tasks.<ref name=\"JvS\" />\n\nUnknown to Sidious and the Jedi, Maul had survived and had been hiding in [[Lotho Minor/Legends|Lotho Minor]] for [[20 BBY/Legends|over a decade]], succumbing to madness until his brother, [[Savage Opress/Legends|Savage Opress]], [[Talisman of Finding/Legends|found]] him<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{TCW|Brothers (episode)}}</ref> and brought him home to [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]] to be cured.<ref name=\"Revenge\">{{TCW|Revenge (episode)}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the Trade Federation leaders were taken to Coruscant for trial, though Sidious's manipulations ensured that they never came to a verdict; relations between the Naboo humans and the native Gungans improved considerably, with the two cooperating on numerous projects and public works; and Anakin Skywalker was accepted for Jedi training, his actions in the battle convincing the Jedi Council that he had the Force on his side.<ref name=\"JvS\" />\n\n====Consolidation====\n[[File:Palpatine-ROTS.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Chancellor Palpatine.]]\nSidious was quick to eliminate any evidence of his involvement in the battle. Republic investigators claimed Maul's ship and equipment, but their bungled efforts to examine them resulted in their self-destruction. After the burned out wreck received a more careful examination by Jedi Master [[Saesee Tiin/Legends|Saesee Tiin]], he recommended that it be placed in the care of the Jedi Council. However, representatives from Kuat lobbied for the opportunity to study it, and the ship disappeared on its way to a Kuat facility.<ref name=\"JvS\" />\n\nWith these loose ends tied up, Sidious set about laying the foundations for the coming Clone Wars, and enacting several other minor schemes to whittle away the Jedi ranks little by little. Moving into the Chancellor's Suite in the Republic Executive Building, Palpatine redecorated the office to suit his own tastes, hiding many priceless Sith artifacts in plain sight, as many were too obscure to be recognized.\n\nAlso, Palpatine required a personal detachment of body guards, but he could not be seen actively creating one. So he instead created a situation where they were apparently forced on him. While speaking with his unwitting pawn; [[Ronhar Kim]]; he had several members of his Senate Guard detachment attempt to assassinate him. Kim fended them off, and the survivors committed suicide on the spot. However, the damage was done, and the Red Guard was created.<ref name=\"Republic64BLOODLINES\" /> At some point, Palpatine sent a group of agents, [[Vor'en Kurn]], [[Rorworr (Naboo)|Rorworr]], [[Sia-Lan Wezz]], and [[Deel Surool]], to [[Mission to Puloorn|look into the]] apparent existence of a [[Sith temple (Puloorn)|Sith temple]] on the world of [[Puloorn]].<ref name=\"RCRB\">''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook]]''</ref> When his first term ended, Palpatine ensured that no opposing candidates rose up while keeping his own image spotless. This would be the last election in the history of the Republic, with a constitutional amendment near the end of his second term allowing him to serve indefinitely.\n\n====The New Apprentice====\n[[File:TheSeductionofDooku.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sidious's new apprentice.]]\nWhile Darth Maul was ill-suited for the tasks needed, Palpatine still required an apprentice. However, he could not simply train a new one from infancy as he had done with Maul, as neglecting his political career for his Sith duties could prove disastrous, and Anakin Skywalker was not yet a viable option. He examined several potential candidates, such as the Jedi [[Vergere]] and [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]]. After Vergere attempted to assassinate him and fled, Palpatine settled on Dooku.\n\nDooku proved best-suited for what Sidious had in mind. A powerful Jedi master and a highly skilled duelist, Dooku was also known as a maverick and a political activist. Having left the Jedi Order in the wake of the Battle of Naboo, Dooku was also a free agent. Sidious approached him, and after long hours of discussion, convinced the ex-Jedi to join him. As a test of Dooku's commitment, Sidious set him after his old friend and colleague from the Jedi, Master [[Sifo-Dyas/Legends|Sifo-Dyas]]. Dyas, anticipating the coming chaos, had contracted the cloners on Kamino to create a clone army. While Sidious planned to seize control of this army, he couldn't allow Dyas to survive. Dooku killed him.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\">''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]''</ref>\n\nDooku was officially brought into the Sith fold, bestowed with the name Darth Tyranus.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\" />\n\n====Instigating The Clone Wars====\n[[File:GrandArmyoftheRepublic-BF.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Clone Army, an important factor of Sidious's plan.]]\nDarth Tyranus subsequently infiltrated the Jedi Archives and erased several star-systems from the maps, most importantly Kamino, stealing information about several hyperspace lanes in the deep core, as well.\n\nThe next thing Darth Sidious needed to settle was whose DNA would be used to produce the new clone army. At the same time, another problem had presented itself, for the [[Bando Gora/Legends|Bando Gora]] cult had returned, and Sidious believed they had enough influence to endanger his plans. Sidious ordered Tyranus to deal with these problems, and Dooku obliged, putting a bounty of five million credits over the leader of the cult, [[Komari Vosa]], and leaving the job to the bounty hunter to finish her off. Dooku also planned to ask the successful bounty hunter to be the model for the new clone army, knowing that several powerful mercenaries would seek to achieve the considerable bounty. [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]], a Mandalorian bounty hunter, was able to defeat Komari Vosa at the moon Kohlma and was going to spare her life when Dooku appeared and killed her himself. Dooku then told Jango Fett that he wanted him to be the basis for the clone army.\n\nAt a later meeting, Dooku tried to make Jango speak more about his past. The bounty hunter, not trusting Dooku because he was once a Jedi, tried to increase his payment by infecting the Sith Lord with a biological weapon. Dooku pretended to be defeated, but convinced Jango to tell the rest of his story. After Fett finished, Dooku healed himself with the force, eliminating Jango's advantage. Jango finally submitted, allowing himself to be cloned on the condition of having an unaltered clone to be his son.\n\nLater, Dooku supported [[Kh'aris Fenn]] when he tried to take power on planet [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]]. He did this believing that under Kh'aris, Ryloth would secede from the Republic when the Clone Wars began. In order to gain leverage, Fenn kidnapped [[Nat Secura]], son of [[Lon Secura]], who was Kh'aris's enemy. A Jedi Master named [[Tholme/Legends|Tholme]] attempted to rescue Nat, but was captured himself, and was only spared because Dooku believed he could use Tholme at a later date. Unfortunately for Dooku, two more Jedi arrived, [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]] and [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]], and they managed to rescue Nat and stop Kh'aris Fenn from gaining control of Ryloth. Although Dooku's plans failed, the Jedi had absolutely no clue he was involved.\n\nDooku also assisted the [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] when they tried to eliminate the army that served the [[Wookiee Trade Guild]], since the Guild refused to pay taxes to the Federation. Because no Wookiees survived the battle, Dooku's involvement was unknown to the Jedi.\n\nDooku and his master continued to plot the war against the Republic, and decided to use the Trade Federation and other corporations in order to make a large enough rift in the galaxy. Darth Sidious decided that the general to be behind the Separatist army should be the Kaleesh warrior [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]], and sent Dooku to retrieve him.\n\n=====Creating the Confederacy and Stirring the Senate=====\n[[File:Grievous-TCWLD.png|thumb|right|250px|Grievous, general of the Confederacy]]\nDooku spoke to San Hill of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, for he knew that Grievous was last hired by them. Together they made a plan to cripple the commander and rebuild him as a cyborg. An ion bomb was planted on Grievous's shuttle, and his seat rigged so that when the bomb went off, the Kaleesh would be ejected.\n\nAfter the craft crashed, Dooku found a gravely injured Grievous and transported him to Geonosis. There, the Kaleeshan was made into a cyborg that would be perfect for the Clone Wars, with the combined power of his tactical genius.\n\nThe Sith were very happy with the new Grievous, and only more so after Dooku trained him to be an expert lightsaber duelist. The droid armies now had a general, a position that Dooku did not want for himself.\n\nDooku then commandeered a communications station and delivered a speech that greatly criticized the Republic. He then asked several systems to secede from the government, and to join his Separatist Movement. Some planets did indeed listen to his speech, and in some cases they built up private armies against the Republic, though it had not yet reached open war.\n\nBecause of this, Darth Sidious, as Chancellor Palpatine, was allowed to keep his position, which canceled the next election. He then offered to make a fake peaceful meeting with Dooku, but it had been planned beforehand by the Sith. Dooku did not reply, which made the Separatists look like they could not be bargained with.\n\nPalpatine then tried to make an army for the Republic, and set out to get the [[Military Creation Act/Legends|Military Creation Act]] approved. He used a number of debates and even assassinations to show the inadequacy of the Jedi and the need for an army, although he publicly looked as if he had taken no side on the issue.\n\n====The Clone Wars Begin====\n[[File:Jangoclones.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jango Fett, the clone template, and the clone army behind him.]]\nAlthough everything was prepared for the Clone Wars, Dooku had run into a few complications. The Fondor Shipyards were critical to the Sith's plans, but three conspirators, [[Groodo]], [[Rodd]], and [[Hurlo Holowan]] sought to destroy them. Dooku managed to stop them by once again hiring Jango Fett, and after the trio was brought to him, they agreed to work for the Sith Lord.\n\nCount Dooku then recruited scientist [[Jenna Zan Arbor]] to the Separatist cause, and she became one of the leading scientists for the CIS.\n\nDooku then tried to bolster the Separatists by trying to make the planet [[Ansion/Legends|Ansion]] secede from the Republic, for it was the basis of several minor alliances, including the [[Malarian Alliance]]. If Ansion left the Republic, other systems would follow suit. Dooku left this to be done by [[Commerce Guild/Legends|Commerce Guild]] [[Shu Mai/Legends|Shu Mai]], who gave a considerable amount of support to Ansion's government, The [[Unity of Community]], making it consider joining the Separatist. The plan failed due to the intervention of Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Luminara Unduli/Legends|Luminara Unduli]], as well as their Padawans [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Barriss Offee/Legends|Barriss Offee]]. Dooku later explained to Shu Mai that the secession of Ansion was not necessary to the Confederacy's success.\n\nAlthough Darth Tyranus had gathered a large number of allies around him, he had only a pledge of support from the Trade Federation. Viceroy Gunray demanded the assassination on Senator Amidala as recompense for his defeat at her hands on Naboo before he would commit his droid armies to the Separatist cause. Dooku gave the order to Jango Fett who, in turn, collaborated with former ally [[Zam Wesell/Legends|Zam Wesell]]. After failing to kill the Senator upon her arrival on the Republic capital, she tried again by sending a remote droid with two lethally toxic insects to Amidala's apartment. This plan was foiled by the Senator's newly appointed Jedi protectors: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. After chasing Wesell across the city, they eventually cornered her in a bar and she lost her arm to Obi-Wan's lightsaber. During her interrogation, just as she was about to reveal Jango's involvement, she was killed by a toxic dart fired (unbeknownst to the Jedi) by Fett himself.\n\nThe Jedi Council then assigned Anakin to escort the Senator home to Naboo - his first solo assignment - whilst Obi-Wan was to discover the nature of the threat to Padm\u00e9's life. Obi-Wan searched through the Jedi archives for information on the toxic dart, but was forced to seek advice from an old acquaintance. This friend identified the weapon as a [[Mk I Saberdart|Kamino saberdart]], used by the cloners of the planet Kamino. Obi-Wan returned to the archives and searched for the planet but was unable to find it, earning him a rather harsh rebuke from the archivist when he theorized that the archives were \"incomplete\". Finally seeking insight from Master Yoda, Obi-Wan discovered that the planetary data had been erased from the archives - a cause of great concern to both himself and Yoda.\n\nTraveling \"to the center of gravity's pull\" as advised by Yoda, Obi-Wan found Kamino exactly where it should have been. After landing, he was escorted to the Prime Minister who proudly displayed the 100,000 strong Clone Army and promised that a million extra troops were almost ready for deployment. After reporting this information back to the Council, Obi-Wan was order to return Fett to them for questioning. While attempting to capture the bounty hunter, he was forced to place a tracking device on the hull of Slave 1.\n\nJango fled Kamino to [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]], where a meeting between Dooku and all of the Separatist leaders was taking place. They were finally forming the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], a government that would stand against the Republic. This would be made up an alliance between the [[Corporate Alliance/Legends|Corporate Alliance]], [[Geonosian Industries/Legends|Geonosian Industries]], the Commerce Guild, the Techno Union, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and the Trade Federation. Obi-Wan had pursued Fett to Geonosis, and witnessed the meeting. He then attempted to contact the Jedi Council, but was captured by the Geonosians, and was imprisoned in a containment field, which kept him totally incapacitated.\n\nThe Senate had indeed received Obi-Wan's message, but Palpatine planned to use it for his own purposes. He showed the message to the Jedi, who agreed he should be given emergency powers. Representative Jar Jar Binks then volunteered to speak his mind to the senate, and his speech to the many senators was shocking, for they had believed him to be a total buffoon. The majority of the Senate instantly agreed with the Representative, and the power to make a military was finally given to Darth Sidious.\n\n=====Arena Bloodbath=====\n[[File:PetranakiArenaBattle-CGSWG.png|thumb|right|300px|The Jedi, attempting to hold off the droid ambush.]]\nChancellor Palpatine finally enlisted the Clones to be the Grand Army of the Republic. Jedi Master [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] himself went to retrieve the clones, while a Jedi taskforce was sent to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nAt the same time, Count Dooku decided to interrogate Kenobi himself. Dooku used Drain Knowledge on the captive Jedi, searching for areas for him to be turned to the Dark Side. The Sith Lord attempted to turn Obi-Wan by saying the Republic was corrupt and that Kenobi's old master, Qui-Gon Jinn would have joined him if he was still alive. Kenobi denied him, and said that Dooku was a traitor. Darth Tyranus finally gave up, and left the Jedi in his cell.\n\nAnakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala arrived in an effort to rescue Obi-Wan, but were then captured themselves. Count Dooku offered the senator freedom if she supported the Separatists, but she refused. The two Jedi and Amidala were then sentenced to death in the arena.\n\nThe [[Petranaki/Legends|Petranaki]] arena was packed with Geonosian spectators, and Count Dooku Jango Fett, and other Separatist leaders watched from a high balcony. Three monsters, an [[Acklay/Legends|acklay]], a [[Reek/Legends|reek]], and a [[Nexu/Legends|nexu]] were released to devour the victims.\n\nFinally, the Jedi [[Jedi assault team/Legends|Geonosis strike team]] arrived. Jedi Master [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] confronted Darth Tyranus, but was chased off by Jango, who fought down in the arena.\n\nDooku was not surprised by the Jedi's ambush, and revealed that the captives he had were just bait for a trap. 10,000 battledroids were waiting for the attack, including a large number of Geonosian warriors. The new [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|Separatist Droid Army]] quickly overwhelmed the Jedi, and many of them would die while Lord Tyranus watched from the balcony.\n\n=====The Clones Attack=====\n[[File:YodaTyranusduel.png|thumb|left|250px|Yoda and Darth Tyranus dueling.]]\nCount Dooku did not join the battle, but Jedi master [[Coleman Trebor/Legends|Coleman Trebor]] attempted to challenge the Sith Lord. He was unable to actually engage Dooku, for Jango managed to kill the Jedi before a duel commenced. After the Jedi had taken significant losses, Darth Tyranus ordered his droids to cease fire. He then asked Mace Windu to surrender, which was refused.\n\nSuddenly master Yoda arrived with the Clone Army in tow. The Jedi had taken control of the clones, without knowing that was exactly what Darth Sidious had wanted. The battle droids attacked again, but the reinforcements allowed the Jedi to escape from the arena.\n\nOutside of the arena, an even larger force of clones was engaging the Separatist army. The [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|Battle of Geonosis]] was heavily tipped to the side of the Republic, and the Separatists were in full retreat. The Confederacy's leaders regrouped at the Geonosian command center, and decided to abandon the planet. Tyranus pretended he knew nothing of the Clone Army, and Poggle the Lesser ordered his Geonosian warriors to hide underneath the [[Stalgasin hive/Legends|Stalgasin hive]], but not before handing the plans to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|DS-1 Orbital Battle Station]] to his master.\n\nDooku was now free to leave the planet, and retreated to his hangar, where he prepared his solar sailor. He was then attacked by the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, but managed to defeat both of them. Before he was able to kill them or fly away, He was confronted by Yoda.\n\nAlthough Dooku used both his Force abilities and his dueling skills, he was unable to do more than hold off the Jedi Grandmaster's onslaught. In an attempt to distract Yoda, he tipped a massive column with the force, which fell towards Kenobi and Skywalker, who were still unable to move. Yoda broke off the battle to save the two, allowing the Sith Lord to escape in his Solar Sailor.\n\nDarth Tyranus then arrived on Coruscant, where he met with Darth Sidious himself at the Works. Dooku informed Palpatine that the Clone Wars had begun, and gave his master the [[Death Star plans/Legends|Death Star plans]] to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|DS-1 Orbital Battle Station]].\n\n====Early Conflicts in the Clone Wars====\n{{Quote|I have good news for you, my Lord. The war has begun.\"''<br />''\"Excellent. Everything is going as planned.|Darth Tyranus and Darth Sidious|audio=TheWarHasBegun-AOTC.ogg|<ref name=\"Episode 2\">{{Film|II}}</ref>}}\nAfter reporting to his master, Dooku traveled to his secret base on [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]], hoping to regroup the Separatist forces. Unfortunately for him, this move was expected by Jedi [[Tholme/Legends|Tholme]] and [[Sora Bulq/Legends|Sora Bulq]]. The pair [[Mission to Bakura (Clone Wars)|confronted]] Dooku, hoping to defeat the Sith still tired from the attack on Geonosis.\n\nThe trio began a vicious duel, in which Dooku used force lightning to defeat Bulq. He then attempted to bring Tholme over to the dark side, but the Jedi refused. Dooku brought down the roof on Tholme, presuming him dead. The Sith Lord then left with the unconscious body of Sora.\n\nDooku healed Bulq and persuaded him to turn to the Dark side of the force, becoming one of the first [[Dark Acolyte/Legends|Dark Acolytes]]. Sora returned to Tholme and rescued him from the rubble. Both of them returned to Coruscant, allowing the Sith to have a spy within the Jedi order.\n\n[[File:70RepublicYouthSpeechFinal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public approval was high for Chancellor Palpatine during the Clone Wars.]]\nBecause of the Clone Wars, Palpatine was able to consolidate his power as Chancellor. Several amendments were made to the constitution that handed more power to Palpatine, including Statute 312b, which gave more weight to votes cast by Core and Inner Rim worlds, who were more dependable on supporting the Chancellor than those of Rim Worlds.\n\nDooku had also begun the excavation of the [[Force Harvester]] on Raxus Prime, so he could recreate the Sith weapon the [[Dark Reaper]]. While on Raxus Prime, Dooku put a live bounty on Jango Fett's son Boba, who had escaped during the Battle of Geonosis. The bounty hunter [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] captured Fett and brought him to Dooku, who held him on Raxus Prime so that the Sith lord could find out how much Boba knew about his Sith identity.\n\nFett ignored Dooku's instructions and instead investigated the excavation. Dooku became irritated at Boba's actions, and ordered the boy to be killed. But due to a sudden Jedi attack on Raxus Prime, Dooku left his new bodyguard [[Cydon Prax]] to kill Fett. Boba evaded Dooku's enforcers and escaped.\n\nDuring the [[Conquest of Raxus Prime]], Dooku and Cydon Prax found the Force Harvester just as a Clone Army, led by Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, arrived to attack the Separatists. As the Clones overwhelmed the Separatists, Dooku and Prax boarded a cruiser with the Harvester on board, but Skywalker spotted them and boarded the cruiser. Dooku and Skywalker dueled in the cargo bay of the cruiser, but Prax ended it by shooting Skywalker with a tranquilizer dart.\n\nDooku imprisoned Anakin on [[Alaris Prime/Legends|Alaris Prime]], one of Kashyyyks moons. Dooku was going to test the harvester there, but Skywalker escaped and freed the Wookiees, causing the [[Liberation of Alaris Prime|Battle of Alaris Prime]]. Dooku fled the moon, taking the harvester with him. The Sith lord used the harvester to drain the life-force from inhabitants of [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]], Bakura and [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] before retreating to [[Thule/Legends|Thule]] to prepare the rest of the Dark Reaper for use.\n\n=====Battle of Thule=====\nThe Jedi attacked Thule to destroy the Dark Reaper, which Dooku soon tried using on the Republic forces. But Skywalker broke through the Separatist lines to reach the weapon, killing Prax in the process. Skywalker had learned from a hologram of Jedi [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] of how to resist the effects of the Dark Reaper, so he was able to destroy the weapon and its harvester. Dooku fled, and later made a public statement that Raxus Prime and other worlds were only temporary bases, while the important Separatist planets were secure.\n\nDooku later ordered his Dark Acolyte [[Sev'rance Tann/Legends|Sevrance Tann]] to capture the Republic world [[Sarapin/Legends|Sarapin]]. She did, but the Republic soon took it back during the [[Battle of Krant]], killing Tann.\n\nTwo months after the Battle of Geonosis, Dooku traveled to [[The Cauldron]], a gladiatorial arena on [[Rattatak/Legends|Rattatak]]. He was greeted by his host and taken to watch the contest. He soon realized that [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]], a [[Dathomirian/Legends|Dathomirian]] warlord, had assassinated Dooku's guide, seeking to impress the Sith. Dooku complimented her skills, but told the warlord that he was not looking for a spy.\n\nVentress then jumped into the arena, killing all of the gladiators. Dooku congratulated her, but then Ventress claimed that she was a Sith. Dooku refuted that statement, and Asajj attacked him in anger. The Sith Lord easily incapacitated her with force lightning before she could reach him.\n\n[[File:AsajjVentress-TCWLD.png|thumb|left|200px|Asajj Ventress, one of Dooku's dark acolytes]]\nDooku brought the unconscious Ventress to a room on Rattatak, and attacked her when she woke up. They dueled, and Ventress was so skilled that she proved difficult for Dooku to defeat, but he managed to disarm her and destroy her lightsabers. But Dooku did not kill Asajj, and instead introduced her to his master, Darth Sidious, who sent her on a mission to find and kill Anakin Skywalker.\n\nTyranus believed that Ventress would defeat Skywalker, but Sidious said that the outcome did not matter. Ventress did not succeed in killing Skywalker, but she continued to serve Dooku as a dark acolyte and commander.\n\n=====The First Battle of Kamino=====\nThe two Sith lords soon developed a plan that would leave the Confederacy and the Republic locked in conflict. [[Merai|Commander Merai]], a [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] and one of the Confederacy's best tacticians, planned the [[First Battle of Kamino]] to wipe out the Republic's cloning facilities. The Jedi Knight Aayla Secura discovered the planned attack, and warned the Republic, but when Dooku's agent [[Tookarti]] warned the Sith, Dooku said it did not matter.\n\nThe battle went exactly as planned. The Republic ambushed the Confederacy's ships, and Merai was killed while his fleet routed. Dooku regretted Merai's death, but Sidious was pleased with how the battle had ended any quick ending to the war. Losses on both sides maintained the balance between the Republic and CIS.\n\nDooku was prevented by the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]] from having a Sith apprentice, but he still made his own group of Dark Acolytes. These included Asajj Ventress and Sora Bulq, and then [[Tol Skorr]], [[Kadrian Sey]], [[Trenox]] and [[Saato]]. He did train them, but taught them little of Sith teachings.\n\nDooku also enlisted the [[Gen'Dai/Legends|Gen'Dai]] mercenary [[Durge/Legends|Durge]] to aide the Separatists, and used Sora Bulq to create strife in the Jedi Order. Bulq tried to convince some Jedi to join the Confederacy, but this was foiled by Mace Windu, who revealed Sora as a traitor.\n\n====Sidious' triumph====\nIn [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], Darth Maul returned to the Known Galaxy, having survived his injuries on Naboo. He took his brother, [[Savage Opress/Legends|Savage Opress]], as an apprentice, and together they attempted to conquer [[Mandalore/Legends|Mandalore]] with the aid of the [[Death Watch/Legends|Death Watch]]. They came to the attention of Darth Sidious, who murdered Opress and imprisoned Maul for his own ends.\n\nIn [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], with the Clone Wars approaching their conclusion and the Separatists [[Outer Rim Sieges/Legends|besieged]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], Darth Sidious was ready to make his final move. At the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|Battle of Coruscant]], he betrayed Tyranus and goaded [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] into killing him, driving Anakin closer to the dark side. Separated from his master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Anakin leaned heavily on the advice of Sidious' persona of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and was slowly convinced that turning to the dark side of the Force was the only way he could save his wife, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], from death in childbirth. Proclaimed [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] by Sidious, Anakin became his new apprentice, [[Order 66/Legends|murdering]] much of the Jedi on Coruscant before [[Mission to Mustafar/Legends|assassinating]] the [[Separatist Council/Legends|Separatist Council]] on [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]], ending the Clone Wars. Capitalizing on the threat of a \"Jedi rebellion\" and his emergency powers as Supreme Chancellor, Sidious dissolved the Republic and [[Declaration of a New Order|proclaimed]] a [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], and was acclaimed as [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] by the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]]. The Sith ruled the galaxy once more, from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] to [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]].<ref name=\"SW3\" />\n\nFrom [[19 BBY/Legends|19]] to [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]], Darth Sidious eradicated most of the Jedi in the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]],<ref name=\"SW3\" /> driving the few survivors, like Obi-Wan Kenobi and [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]], into hiding. The galaxy was [[Imperialization/Legends|Imperialized]] and the Galactic Empire conducted numerous atrocities to solidify its rule. It was not until [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]] that an [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|alliance of rebels and dissidents]] emerged to challenge the Galactic Empire, beginning the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], Obi-Wan Kenobi successfully convinced Darth Vader's son [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], whom Vader had thought dead with his wife, to train as a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] and help overthrow the Empire. Luke was responsible for the destruction of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[Battle station/Legends|battle station]] at the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], dealing a stunning blow to the Empire but bringing the survival of Anakin Skywalker's children to the Sith's attention.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\">{{Film|IV}}</ref><ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\">{{Film|V}}</ref>\n\n===The end of the Banite Sith===\n[[File:EmperorPalpatineForcelightning-EGTF.jpg|thumb|190px|Darth Sidious before his first death.]]\nSidious plotted to turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side and replace Vader. Having learned of his parentage, Luke was determined to turn his father back to the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side of the Force]]. Allowing himself to be taken prisoner, Luke was brought before Sidious aboard the Empire's [[Death Star II/Legends|Second Death Star]], where he engaged Vader in a [[Battle of Endor/Legends|ferocious duel]] while imploring him to turn back the light side. Enraged by Luke's refusal to turn to the dark side, Sidious attempted to murder him with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]], but the sight of his son being tortured to death was enough to convince Vader to turn against his Sith master. Anakin Skywalker hurled Sidious down the Death Star's reactor shaft but suffered mortal injuries in the process. At the same time, the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] attacked and destroyed the Second Death Star at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], dealing to the Galactic Empire a blow from which it would never recover. Luke escaped the Death Star with his father's body. Anakin's death and redemption and the death of Darth Sidious marked the presumed extinction of the Sith Order, thus fulfilling the Ancient Jedi Prophecy of the [[Chosen One/Legends|Chosen One]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\">{{Film|VI}}</ref>\n\nWith its Emperor gone, Sidious' empire collapsed into [[Warlord/Legends|warlordism]] and the Alliance proclaimed a [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Sidious' spirit survived, however, and it made an agonizing journey to the Imperial redoubt of [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]]. Reborn in a cloned body, Sidious attempted to restore the Galactic Empire in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]] with a [[Operation Shadow Hand|massive military campaign]] launched out of the Deep Core. Sidious planned to establish a \"[[Dark Empire]],\" an avowedly-Sith magocracy governed and run by the Force influence of his [[Dark Side Elite]]. However, Sidious' clone bodies were poisoned by [[Carnor Jax]], who hoped to proclaim himself Emperor in Sidious' place, and the dying Sith Lord desperately sought a healthy new vessel for his spirit. At the [[Battle of Onderon (Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Onderon]] in [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], Sidious attempted to possess the infant [[Anakin Solo]]. However, he was shot in the back by [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and his spirit was dragged into the [[Netherworld of the Force/Legends|Netherworld of the Force]] by the mortally-wounded Jedi [[Empatojayos Brand]], ensuring that he could never be resurrected and destroying what little remained of [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane's]] Sith.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Dark Empire\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]''</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|I'm not sure I even count the Emperor's clones as Sith.

After a [[Great Galactic War]] that lasted for many decades, the Sith and the Republic signed a treaty and from that moment existed as two separate governments.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Old Republic\" />\n\n'''[[Lost Tribe of Sith]]'''\n\nIn [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], a Sith [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the ''[[Omen]]'', crashed-landed on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of Kesh. The survivors of the crash eventually formed the Lost Tribe. Over thousands of years, this Lost Tribe had multiplied into a substantial force, and shortly after the [[Second Galactic Civil War]] they were ready to fulfill their destiny, and take on a weakened [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].\n\n'''[[Brotherhood of the Sith]]'''\n\nThe Brotherhood of the Sith was a group of Dark Jedi founded by [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] who broke away from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] to study Sith techniques. During the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]], the Brotherhood attempted to conquer the Republic with the aid of the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] and the [[Mandalorian Crusaders]]. The Brotherhood was defeated and virtually exterminated during the [[Battle of Yavin 4 (Great Sith War)|Battle of Yavin 4]].\n\n'''[[Krath/Legends|Krath]]'''\n\nThe Krath was a Sith secret society founded by [[Aleema Keto|Aleema]] and [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal Keto]], the bored heirs to the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]]. Following a Krath attack on a Jedi conclave, [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] attempted to infiltrate the group, but he failed. He was seduced to the dark side and eventually became the leader of the sect.

Built upon a hardened core of veterans from the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and a host of Jedi converts, the fledgling new galactic power very nearly succeeded in conquering the Republic during the [[Jedi Civil War]]. After the redemption of Darth Revan and the death of Darth Malak, their Empire splintered into factions and eventually collapsed.\n\n'''[[Sith Triumvirate]]'''\n\nThe Sith Triumvirate was a brief but deadly Sith Order founded by the former Jedi Kreia, now known as Darth Traya, she took two apprentices of unknown origins and trained many new Sith at the [[Trayus Academy]] on [[Malachor V]]. After her exile from the Triumvirate the two remaining Sith Lords; [[Darth Nihilus]], and [[Darth Sion]] executed the [[First Jedi Purge]]. The Sith Triumvirate was a loose alliance of what remained of Darth Revan's Sith Empire. It was solidified sometime after the [[Battle of Rakata Prime]]. This organization comprised several, if not hundreds of Sith apprentices, Sith Masters and most importantly, Sith Assassins. The members were eventually defeated by Meetra Surik.\n\n'''[[New Sith]] Empire'''\n\nThe [[New Sith]] Empire was founded by [[Darth Ruin]], and was the vast area of galactic territory formed out of the [[Fourth Great Schism]], which the Sith ruled over with an iron fist. Its capital was the planet [[Roon/Legends|Roon]]. At its height during the [[New Sith Wars]], it was almost as good as the old Sith Empires of [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]] and [[Revan/Legends|Darth Revan]]; following the [[Battle of Mizra]] and during the [[Republic Dark Age]], it encompassed a great percentage of the known Galaxy.\n\nSometime between 1010 and 1006 BBY the [[New Sith]] Empire collapsed in a civil war. From the ashes, [[Skere Kaan]] established the [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]].\n\n'''[[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]]'''\n\nFounded by Lord Kaan, the Brotherhood of Darkness (sometimes referred to as the Dark Army) was the last mass gathering of the Sith for nearly 1200 years. An army of over twenty thousand [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] and their followers, its destruction on [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]] heralded the beginning of a [[Rule of Two/Legends|new order]].\n\n'''[[Order of the Sith Lords]]'''\n\nUnder the last surviving [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] of that army, [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]], a new Sith Order was created as a result of the devastating [[Seventh Battle of Ruusan]], which saw the annihilation of the previous Sith Order. Bane's Sith Order, known formally as the Order of the Sith Lords, was founded upon the principles of [[Revan/Legends|Darth Revan's]] [[Darth Revan's Sith Holocron|Holocron]], where from he formed the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]], utilizing stealth tactics and treachery to achieve their means. The Rule of Two would allow his eventual successor, [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]], to finally triumph over the Jedi and the Galactic Republic nearly 1,000 years later.\n\n'''[[Disciples of Ragnos]]'''\n\nThe Disciples of Ragnos was a Sith Cult under the leadership of [[Tavion Axmis]], who sought to resurrect the spirit of Marka Ragnos through ancient Sith sorcery and take control of the galaxy. The cult was closely related to the [[Empire Reborn]] movement of which Tavion had herself been part with the Dark Jedi [[Desann]]. The cult was ultimately defeated by [[Jaden Korr]] and the [[New Jedi Order]].\n\n'''[[Lumiya's Sith]]'''\n\n[[Lumiya]]'s Sith were a loosely collected group of individuals associated with Lumiya, self-proclaimed [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lady of the Sith]] after the final death of Darth Sidious. Even with Palpatine's final death, the Sith continued to survive. Their next Sith Lord was an [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hand]] named Lumiya. [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] had passed on to Lumiya some Sith teaching secretly from his master, and the woman adopted the title \"Dark Lady of the Sith\" upon her master's death at Endor. She trained two apprentices: [[Flint]], who was redeemed by Vader's son [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and [[Carnor Jax]], who was killed by Palpatine loyalist [[Kir Kanos]].\n\nSoon afterwards she succeeded in convincing Vader's grandson [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] to join the ranks of the Sith, thus calling himself Darth Caedus. Darth Caedus later corrupted the Jedi [[Tahiri Veila]] and took her as his apprentice. However, following the death of Caedus and the redemption of his apprentice, the [[Second Galactic Civil War|war]] Lumiya had started was over; and Lumiya's Sith had perished.\n\n'''[[One Sith]]'''\n\nBy the year [[130 ABY]], a new Sith Order had risen to take the place of [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane's]] order. A Sith known as [[Darth Krayt]] began the order on [[Korriban/Legends|Korriban]], the ancient Sith burial world, around\n[[30 ABY/Legends|30 ABY]] after studying the teachings of [[XoXaan]]. In this new Sith cult, many of the followers sported a red-and-black tattooed appearance and used [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]] with an yorik coral-styled hilt design. This Sith Order was considered heretical by some Sith of the past such as Darth Bane, who disapproved of the training of larger numbers of Sith. Krayt spent over a century growing and strengthening the new order, planning to unify the galaxy once more under Sith rule. He and his new order made their presence known around [[127 ABY|127]]-[[130 ABY]] by initiating the [[Sith\u2013Imperial War]], and then launching an [[Massacre at Ossus|attack on the Jedi]] on Ossus. In [[138 ABY]] Darth Krayt fell and [[Darth Nihl]] claimed control of the Order, sending the One Sith into hiding. The One Sith, however, would apparently end up mostly wiped out by [[Darth Wredd]], a believer in the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]] and aided by the Fel Empire. .<ref name=\"Legacy 2\" />\n\n==Ranks==\nThe Sith had a clearly defined hierarchy which divided the strong from the weak, but because the Sith order existed in numerous disparate incarnations, the Sith hierarchy did not maintain a single continuous ranking system throughout its history. The Sith hierarchy remained much the same for almost 6,000 years - through the ancient Sith Empire, Exar Kun's Brotherhood of the Sith, and Darth Revan's Sith Empire - until Lord Kaan declared that all of his highest ranking followers in the Brotherhood of Darkness were Dark Lords of the Sith. Like the Jedi and the Old Republic, the Sith underwent a great reformation after the apocalyptic final Battle of Ruusan. The Sith order's destruction inspired Darth Bane to reform the order and decree that there would be only two Sith at a time from that point forward: a Master and an apprentice. Both would bear the title \"Dark Lord of the Sith,\" which would become synonymous with the term \"Sith Lord.\"\n\n===Sith Empire===\nThese were the ranks of the Sith Order before [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]] instituted the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]].\n\n'''[[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]]'''\n[[File:DarthSidious-NEGTC.png|thumb|right|250px|Darth Sidious, a Dark Lord of the Sith]]\n\nDark Lords of the Sith were the greatest and most powerful of the Sith Lords. Up until the reign of Kaan, it was a title that was only given to those that were acknowledged as the leaders of their order, but by the end of the New Sith Wars the title was held by many Sith Lords simultaneously.\n\n'''[[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]]'''\n\nSith Lords were the leaders of the Sith. They commanded armies of Sith Minions, Acolytes and Warriors during wartime and ruled through a governing body known as the [[Sith Council]]. Sith Lords used the dark side of the Force to inflict misery, suffering, and corruption. They were also tasked with preserving the lore of the Sith by passing all their knowledge on to their acolytes. While they did not enter combat as often as lesser Sith (preferring to use pawns, servants, or proxies), they were the most fearsome of the Sith as they were the keepers of the Sith's greatest secrets and wielders of its most potent sorceries.\n\n'''[[Sith Marauder]]'''\n\nSith Marauders, a variant of the Sith Warriors, were often responsible for the most brutal acts carried out by the Sith. Their training emphasized the aggressive use of a lightsaber rather than the Force. A Sith Marauder's berserk physical prowess was a dark side technique fueled by hatred, rage, and cruelty. Thus, most Marauders could duel an average Jedi toe-to-toe and win easily. Caring little for the subtleties of manipulating others and lacking a deep understanding of the Force, Marauders were often burdened with carrying out the wishes of the Sith Lords.\n\n'''[[Sith Warrior]]'''\n\nSith Warrior was a rank of the Sith order before Darth Bane's reform of the Sith Order. They were mid-ranking Sith who generally focused their energies and skills towards battle, spending little time on actual dark side philosophy or other concerns of the \"purer\" Sith.\n\n'[[Sith acolyte/Legends|''Sith Acolyte''']]\n\nSith Acolyte were [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] apprentices who had only just started down the dark path under the tutelage of a more experienced Sith.\n\n'''[[Sith acolyte/Legends|Sith adept]]'''\n\nSith Adept was a Sith rank during the New Sith Wars, similar to Sith acolyte. The Brotherhood of Darkness trained them in the Dathomir Academy and Iridonia Academy.\n\n'''[[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassin]]'''\n[[File:SithAssassin.jpg_|thumb|left|175px|A [[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassin]]]]\n\nSpecialized Sith minions included Sith assassins, who preferred to ambush targets from the shadows rather than engaging them in standard combat. Almost always working solo or in small groups, they utilized stealth field generators and the rare [[Force power/Legends|art]] of [[Force cloak|Force camouflage]] to launch surprise attacks on their Jedi victims. While some used a lightsaber, most fought with more conventional melee weapons such as [[Force pike/Legends|force pikes]]. Darth Traya, [[Darth Sion]], and [[Darth Nihilus]] commanded legions of Sith Assassins during the aftermath of the [[Jedi Civil War]], causing the near-extermination of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi Order]]. The Sith Assassins drew their powers from the Force power of their enemies.\n\n'''[[Sith Minion]]'''\n\nSith Minions were the lowliest members of the Sith. Some were not even [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], and often worshiped the Sith Lords as gods. [[Sith cultist/Legends|Sith Cultists]], [[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassins]] and [[Sith Marauder]]s can be considered examples of Sith Minions. However, the Sith also used soldiers, mercenaries, and conscripts to work for them.\n\n===Post-Bane===\n{{Quote|Two there should be; no more, no less. One to embody power, the other to crave it.|Darth Bane|<ref name=\"Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader\">''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:Vader_Sidious.png|thumb|right|The post-Bane Sith Lords [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].]]\nTo ensure the continued survival of the Sith, Bane was forced to put them on the brink of extinction. He instituted the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]]. In [[Order of the Sith Lords|Bane's order]], both Sith held the title [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]]. The rule of the two instituted that a master train an apprentice. Once the apprentice was fully trained, he would kill the master and take on the mantle himself and repeat the process. The death of the master is either a ceremonial killing or an assassination.\n\n'''[[Sith Master/Legends|Sith Master]]'''\n\nSith Masters were Sith Lords that had an apprentice serving beneath them. Other than Bane, notable Sith Masters include [[Darth Zannah/Legends|Darth Zannah]], [[Darth Cognus]], [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Darth Plagueis]] and his successor; [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]].\n\n'''[[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]]'''\n\nSith apprentices were Sith neophytes that were studying under the tutelage of a Sith Master. Notable Sith apprentices include [[Darth Millennial]], [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]], [[Dooku/Legends|Darth Tyranus]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].\n\n'[[Dark side adept/Legends|''Dark Side Adepts''']]\n\nDark Side Adepts were not technically Sith. These Force-sensitives were chosen and honed by the Sith apprentice. Essentially, adepts were candidates to replace Apprentices when they were killed or ascended to mastery. Notables included [[Dooku/Legends|Darth Tyranus's]] [[Dark Acolyte/Legends|Dark Acolytes]], whose numbers included [[Sora Bulq/Legends|Sora Bulq]] and the infamous [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]], and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] secret apprentice [[Galen Marek]].\n\n===Palpatine Era===\n{{Quote|Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy&hellip;and we shall have peace.|[[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]], to [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]|<ref name=\"SW3\" />}}\n[[File:SidiousVaderPromo-DVSWE.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].]]\nWhen [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] declared himself [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]], the Sith controlled the known galaxy, in a political sense, for the first time. With this new, far-reaching authority came a need for functionaries throughout the Empire who were, to one extent or another, supporters if not adherents of the dark side. Though not Sith in any strict sense, these quasi-Sith minions were known generally as [[Dark side adept/Legends|Dark Side Adepts]]. As Force-sensitive individuals serving the Emperor, they supported his Sith rule by working in the roles of servants, agents, intelligence operatives, military officials, etc. Dark Side Adepts were particularly important when Palpatine was reborn into his clone bodies, six years after his death.\n\n'''[[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]]'''\n\nThe Inquisitorius was a secret division of Imperial Intelligence consisting of dark side Force-sensitive agents known as Inquisitors (sometimes also as Inquisitioners), or \"truth officers\".\n\nUnder the control of Darth Vader, these Inquisitors were considered the highest ranking of the Dark Side Adepts, outranking the Emperor's Hands, Prophets of the Dark Side, and lesser Dark Jedi. They reported directly to Emperor Palpatine.\n\n'''[[Prophets of the Dark Side]]'''\n[[File:Vader-TSS.jpg|thumb|right|Darth Vader in [[Darth Vader's armor/Legends|his armor]]]]\n\nThe Dark Side Prophets were an ancient Outer Rim renegade Sith order founded by [[Darth Millennial]]. Darth Sidious rediscovered the group and brought them once again under his control, renaming them the Emperor's Mages.\n\n'''[[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hands]]'''\n\nEmperor's Hands were top-secret special operatives trained in the Force by the Emperor himself. They were so secret they usually had no knowledge of each other. [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]] was one of the best-known Emperor's Hands.\n\nTogether with the Emperor's Mages, the Emperor's Hands were called the Dark Side Elite.\n\n'''[[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Emperor's Royal Guard]]'''\n\nThese were hand-picked elite [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] assigned to protect and serve the Emperor directly. Force sensitivity was by no means a requirement. Those with advanced talents, however, were assigned as [[Imperial Sovereign Protector|Sovereign Protectors]], and those with even more advanced talents underwent Force training under Dark Jedi tutors. The [[Emperor's Shadow Guard|Shadow Guards]] also possessed dark side training.\n\n'''[[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]]'''\n\nAlthough the name might imply otherwise, Dark Jedi were not synonymous with Sith, although Darth Vader among others used techniques drawn from the traditions of both the Dark Jedi and the Sith. Dark Jedi were distinguished from the Sith in the fact that Dark Jedi just used the dark side, whereas the Sith abided by the religion and codes passed down through the holocrons. It was much more likely for Dark Jedi to return to the Light (e.g. [[Kam Solusar]]). Other notable Dark Jedi included [[Joruus C'baoth]] and [[Jerec (Inquisitor)|Jerec]].\n\n===Legacy Era===\n====Lost Tribe of Sith====\n[[File:Vestara.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vestara Khai]], Sith apprentice of the Lost Tribe]]\nIn [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], the Sith warship ''[[Omen]]'' who had a human crew, member of the [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], crash landed on [[Kesh/Legends|Kesh]]. Spurred on by the ship's captain, [[Yaru Korsin]], the Sith conquered the [[Keshiri/Legends|Keshiri]] indigenous population and became the undisputed rulers of the uncharted planet. But, the planet isolated and devoided of the materials needed to repair the ship, imprisoned these Sith for nearly five thousand years. Forgotten by the rest of the galaxy and by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], the Lost Tribe members developed their society, growing in number and deepening their knowledge over the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]].\nAnd when a [[Ship (Sith Meditation Sphere)|Sith Meditation Sphere]] seeking for new masters to serve, arrived on their adoptive homeworld in [[41 ABY]], they were ready to conquer the galaxy.\n\nVery many and very organized the Lost Tribe of Sith was a hierarchical society based on merit, not birth, which allowed all Force-sensitive inhabitants of Kesh, Human or Keshiri, climbing the rungs of the prevailing order of the Sith. This order included seven ranks, ranging from apprentice without master to the Supreme Head of the Order: Sith Tyro, Sith apprentice, Sith Saber, Sith Master, Sith Lord, High Lord and Grand Lord.\n\n'''[[Grand Lord]]'''\n\nGrand Lord was the title of the ruler of the [[Circle of Lords]], the ruling council of the [[Lost Tribe of Sith]] in the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Tahv]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kesh/Legends|Kesh]]. The first Grand Lord was [[Yaru Korsin]], who was appointed to the position in [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]] by [[Izri Dazh]]. As of [[43 ABY]] the Grand Lord was [[Darish Vol]].\n\n'''[[High Lord]]'''\n\nA High Lord was a presiding member on the Circle of Lords. There were seven High Lords on the Circle; they ranked above the thirteen [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lords]] that sat on the Circle, but below the Grand Lord.\n\n'''[[Sith Saber]]'''\n\nA [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] was promoted to the rank of Sith Saber after they had completed their formal training under a Master, making the rank equivalent to that of a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. When a member of the Tribe obtained the rank of Saber, they were allowed to customize their robes and acquire possessions.\n\n'''[[Sith Tyro]]'''\n\nA Sith Tyro was an apprentice of the Lost Tribe, who had not yet been chosen to become a formal Sith apprentice. It can be considered roughly equivalent to the Jedi rank of [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Initiate]].\n\n====One Sith====\n[[File:ReaveEpicFail-Leg30.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Some of the most prominent [[Legacy era]] Sith with their leader, [[Darth Krayt]] (armored)]]\nBy the year [[130 ABY]] a '''new Sith Order''' had risen to take the place of that of [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane's]] [[Order of the Sith Lords|order]]. Krayt abolished Darth Bane's [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]]. Instead, there would be the [[Rule of One]]&mdash;that One being the Sith Order itself as directed by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], under which there would be many Sith who serve.\n\nRuled by Krayt, the new Sith Order flourished and a chance for Galactic domination presented itself. The reverse Vong-forming of worlds was sabotaged and when the galaxy at large blamed and persecuted the Yuuzhan Vong, the GA and Jedi Order were split down the middle. In the midst of the New Galactic Civil War the [[Fel Empire]] joined forces with the Legacy Sith and brought the galaxy to its knees. The new Sith, however, betrayed the Empire and deposed the Emperor. [[Darth Krayt]] assumed the throne of the Empire. But the deposed Emperor, Roan Fel, set up a rival faction of the Empire that remained loyal to him. Each side tried to dominate the Galaxy in the years to come.\n\nIt is known that a Sith known as Darth Krayt began the order on [[Korriban/Legends|Korriban]], the ancient Sith burial world, around [[30 ABY/Legends|30 ABY]]. In this new Sith cult, many of the followers sported a red and black tattooed appearance.\n\n'''[[Fist]]'''\n\nThe Fist was a Sith Lord who served as the supreme military commander for the new Sith Order. The Fist was appointed to the position by Darth Krayt. As of 137 ABY [[Darth Stryfe]] served as Krayt's Fist. At the [[Massacre at Ossus]], [[Darth Nihl]] was the Fist, but was made a Hand when his [[Darth Nihl's predecessor|predecessor]] was killed during the battle.\n\n'''[[Hand (One Sith)|Hands]]'''\n\nThe Hands were [[Darth Krayt]]'s most able servants, trained and existing to carry out his will. They took only his orders, and reported only to him.\n\nBy 137 ABY, Krayt's only Hand was Darth Nihl, having been given the post when his predecessor died unexpectedly. That year, he made [[Darth Talon]] into his second Hand, a fact that displeased Nihl.\n\n'''[[Sith Intelligence and Assassination]]'''\n\nSith Intelligence and Assassination was an agency of the new Sith Order of Darth Krayt. It was in charge of spying, political murder, and [[Torture/Legends|torture]]. Around 130 ABY, it was headed by [[Darth Maladi]]. [[Jor Torlin]] was one of its ranking agents.\n\n[[Darth Maladi's laboratory]], in the [[Temple of the Sith]], was a location of Sith Intelligence and Assassination.\n\n'''[[Voice]]'''\n\nThe Sith Lord who held the ranks of Voice was the second in command of the One Sith, serving as advisor to the Dark Lord of the Sith and as his caretaker and mouthpiece during Lord Krayt's periods in [[Force Stasis/Legends|stasis]]. This title was held by the line of [[Chagrian/Legends|Chagrian]] Sith Lords known as [[Darth Wyyrlok]]. By the time of the [[Second Imperial Civil War]], there had been three Darth Wyyrloks, while the fourth in line, [[Saarai (Chagrian)|Saarai]] underwent Sith training in Korriban.\n\nAfter the disappearance of Darth Krayt's body, Darth Wyyrlok promoted [[Darth Nihl]] as the new Voice so as to keep his loyalty after his self-proclamation as Emperor.\n\n'''[[Loremaster]]'''\n\nThe Loremaster was a Sith Lord who kept the number of Sith artifacts and records attained by the Order. The third Darth Wyyrlok also held this position, and was an expert in the history of the Sith and the Order's many incarnations throughout the millennia.\n\n'''[[Sith Inquisitor|Inquisitor]]'''\n\nInquisitors were Sith Lords responsible for extracting information of enemy prisoners. They employed a number of techniques, ranging from imprisonment and interrogation to torture. [[Darth Havok]] was an Inquisitor within the order.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|The Sith are people who are very self-centered and selfish. There used to be many Sith, but because they hunger for power, they killed each other off, so now there are only two - a master and an apprentice. Sith rely on their passion to get things done. They use their raw emotion, their hatred, their anger, their bitterness - which is the dark side of the Force. The Force is what binds the galaxy together, and it has a good side and a bad side. The Sith learned how to manipulate both sides of the Force, and then they fell into the trap of being corrupted by the dark side. The Jedi Knights are like marshals in the Wild West. It's their job to make sure everyone is protected, to bring peace. They are the enemy of the Sith, because the Sith want to dominate the galaxy, to control everything, and for a thousand years they have had a plot against the Jedi. So, in this movie, it is time for them to seek revenge against the Jedi for perceived injustices and to carry out that plot.|[[George Lucas]] on the Sith|<ref name=\"SFO\">{{WebCite|url=http://sci-fi-online.com/Interview/05-11-01_GeorgeLucas.htm|text=George Lucas|date=2001-05-11|archivedate=20230317101615}}</ref>}}\nThe Sith first appeared as the primary antagonists of [[George Lucas]]' [[Original trilogy]] and the [[Prequel trilogy]]. The word ''Sith'' itself was first used in the [[Star Wars: A New Hope (novelization)|1976 novelization of ''Star Wars'']] as a title for the key villain [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the \"Dark Lord of the Sith,\" a term cut from the original film. [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']], which premiered in [[1999]], was the first film to use the word proper, and established key concepts including the Rule of Two. In addition, the origins and history of the Sith was explored by several [[Star Wars Legends]] works including the [[1991]] [[Dark Horse Comics]] ''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]'' story arc, the mid-1990s [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (comic series)|''Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi'']] comics, the [[2003]] [[BioWare]] game ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' and [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords|its]] [[Star Wars: The Old Republic|sequels]], [[Drew Karpyshyn]]'s [[Star Wars: Darth Bane Trilogy|''Darth Bane Trilogy'']], the futuristic ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]'' comic series, and [[John Jackson Miller]]'s [[Star Wars: Lost Tribe of the Sith|''Lost Tribe of the Sith'']] novellas. More recently, the canon television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' have touched upon the origins and history of the Sith.\n\nAs first documented in the [[1997]] book ''[[Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays]]'' by [[Laurent Bouzereau]], the antagonists of the story referred as \"Legions of Lettow\" in Lucas's [[1974]] [[The Star Wars first draft|first script draft]] for the [[1977]] [[original trilogy]] film, [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]. The faction would ultimately morph into the Sith.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays\">''[[Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays]]''</ref>\n\nAside from the Star Wars franchise, the word \"Sith\" first appeared in the American science fantasy novel ''The Warlord of Mars'' by Edgar Rice Burroughs in reference to a wasp-like creature the size of a bull.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{ScrollBox|content=\n{{MoreSources}}\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Sith|soundcat=Audio files of Sith}}\n*[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 0|''Tales of

    "plain_text": "the language]]\nStar Wars: Knight Errant]], Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi, Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2\nZiost]] later adopted\nSith Proverb\nThe Sith, also referred to as the Sith Order was a sect of Force-sensitives who utilized the dark side of the Force. The term \"Sith\" originally referred to a species of aliens native to the planets Korriban and Ziost, who were later enslaved and ruled by exiled Dark Jedi from the Galactic Republic. These Dark Jedi had once been members of the Jedi Order, a monastic Force religion dedicated to peace through the use of the light side of the Force. The Dark Jedi embraced the dark side, using its power to manipulate life, which started the Hundred-Year Darkness. However, they had been defeated and subsequently exiled from known space, which led to their discovery of the Sith species. Following centuries of interbreeding and mixing of cultures between the aliens and the exiles, the Sith would no longer be identified by their race, but by their dedication to the ancient Sith philosophy. This religious order would survive in many different incarnations throughout galactic history. The rise of a new leader, or Dark Lord, would often cause drastic reorganizations in the cult. However, the Sith would always be characterized by two key attributes: their lust for absolute power and their desire to destroy their ancient foes, the Jedi Order.\nThe Sith were the most infamous of all dark side religions, and the members of the cult were often seen as the pinnacle of power within the dark side. Throughout their long history, the Sith commanded several Empires and initiated many galactic wars. With such great influence, the Sith religion inspired many cults that weren't technically part of the Sith Order, nor did they consist of actual Sith. Instead, they were founded and made up of Sith devotees and other Force-sensitives dedicated to prolonging the teachings and the memory of the Sith. Such cults included the Naddists, the Disciples of Ragnos, and the Krath.\n\n\u2022 Philosophy\n\nDark side of the Force/Legends\nThe Apprentice (comic story)\n\n\u2022 Forged by fire\n\nkills her master.]]\nThe Sith believed that conflict was the only true test of ones ability, and so emphasized its importance. It was their belief that conflict challenged both individuals and civilizations, and so forced them to grow and evolve. They believed that harmony and the avoidance of conflict and that the pacifist teachings of the Jedi resulted in stagnation and decline.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'\nAnother purpose conflict served was the elevation of the strong and the death of the weak. By encouraging strife, the strong were able to exercise their power while the weak were weeded from the ranks of the Sith. A core tenet of Sith philosophy was self-reliance and the idea that an individual only deserved what they were strong enough to take. Likewise, morality was treated as an obstacle to be overcome, as it got in the way of a Siths ability to recognize and seize opportunities for advancement and self-empowerment. According to the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi shortly before dueling his former friend Anakin Skywalker, turned Sith Lord Darth Vader, a Siths essential characteristic is \"dealing in absolutes.\"III\nSuch philosophies were embraced and taught at Sith academies, where students were encouraged to challenge one another and fight for prestige that would be recognized by the headmaster of the academy. At the academy on Korriban during the Jedi Civil War, students were tasked with gaining prestige so they might become one of the \"chosen few\" accepted into the ranks of Darth Malaks Sith Empire. The strife to achieve prestige caused rivalries and animosity between the students, as there were few tasks that offered prestige, and many prospective Sith. Similarly, the students of the academy during the New Sith Wars were pitted against each other in dueling sessions atop the academy. It was during these dueling sessions that intense rivalries were formed - rivalries that resulted in the deaths of students Fohargh and Sirak at the hands of Darth Bane.Darth Bane: Path of Destruction\n\n\u2022 Empowered by passion\n\nYuthura Ban\nchoking his wife in anger]]\nThe cornerstone of a Siths power was passion. While the Jedi taught that fear, anger, and pain of loss were to be overcome, the Sith believed that these strong emotions were aided individuals in their survival. By harnessing their base emotions rather than being mindful about them, the Sith believed they could achieve true power. This belief was in stark contrast to that of the Jedi, who strived to avoid to be slaves of those emotions. Indeed, the Sith saw passion as the only real way to fully understand the Force. Sith taught to unleash their negative emotionsWitches of the Mist and hoped to keep their passions under control by reminding themselves of the pain of loss, agonizingly sacrificing things and people they hold dear.Legacy of the Force: Betrayal'\nEmpathy, compassion, mercy and other emotions were anathema to the Sith. They often, but not always,Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines like the Jedi, considered romantic love a dangerous emotion, but for different reasons. While the Jedi discouraged romance in order to prevent attachments, Sith did the same to prevent emotions deemed weak by them. However, this didnt stop some Sith from taking lovers. Darth Bane had maintained a relationship with fellow Sith pupil Githany, however he did not allow himself to retain any connections to her and did not regret her death on Ruusan. Similarly Darth Malgus had a lover named Eleena Daru. In Malguss case however, he eventually killed Daru as he believed that she constituted an intolerable weakness.The Old Republic: Deceived\nRegardless, some Sith did have families, either marrying other Sith, or on some occasions having already had lovers and children from before their fall to the dark side\u2014the latter sometimes turning to the dark side in an effort to save their loved ones from perceived threats.Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse Darth Sidious preyed on Anakin Skywalkers love for his wife in order to corrupt him. Some Sith even used their love for more power in the Force.Legacy of the Force: Inferno'\n\n\u2022 The Sith'ari\n\nIn the original Sith, the term \"Sith'ari\" translated literally into \"lord\" or \"overlord\". Over time however, the term became closely associated with the idea of a perfect being, who would rise to power and take control of the Sith Order.\nThe prophesied coming of the Sith'ari was based around the notion that a perfect being, would epitomize the teachings of the Sith Code and became free of all restrictions. This being would lead the Sith, but also destroy them- a destruction that would make the Sith Order stronger than before. The identity of the Sith'ari has been confirmed as Darth Bane,The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia who destroyed the Brotherhood of Darkness in order to remake the Sith through the Rule of Two. Nevertheless, during history other Sith Lords also proclaimed themselves as the Sith'ari.Darth Plagueis The prophesy of the Sith'ari is very similar to the Jedi's prophesy in the meaning of an awaited savior, the Chosen One&mdash;an extremely powerful Force-sensitive who will bring Balance to the Force.\n\n\u2022 Guiding codes\n\n\u2022 The Code of the Sith\n\nCode of the Sith/Legends\nThe Sith Code\nThe code of the Sith was the mantra which stated the core beliefs of the Sith Order and is believed to have been created in contrast to the Jedi Code. The structure of the codes is almost identical, and the initial line of the Sith Code directly contradicts the initial line of the Jedi Code, which reads: \"There is no emotion, there is peace.\"\nFollowing the embrace of passion, which was believed to be a powerful aspect of nature, the code explains that the strength granted by passion leads to power, which then leads to victory. By way of victory, the Sith believed they could free themselves from the limitations of regular beings, and achieve their potential. Neophyte Sith believed that the breaking of chains represented the ability to do whatever one wished, however more seasoned members of the Order recognized that the true meaning of freedom was the end of all physical restrictions and the ability to attain perfection. The Sith believed that the only being who could truly live up to the code and attain freedom was the Sithari, and as such saw it as a guideline by which to live, not a law to abide by.\n\n\u2022 The rule of two\n\nRule of Two/Legends\nDarth Bane\nand Zannah, the first Sith to embrace the Rule of Two]]\nThe Rule of Two was the principle upon which the Order of the Sith Lords was founded. It was created by Darth Bane, a Dark Lord and member of the Brotherhood of Darkness. Bane believed that the Sith had weakened themselves by accepting too many into their ranks and that the true dark side had abandoned them. After studying the Sith holocron of Darth Revan, Bane decided that the Brotherhood needed to be destroyed and the Sith rebuilt as a secretive order consisting of two beings&mdash;a single master and a single apprentice.\nBane believed this philosophy would solve the infighting that had long been the bane of the Sith Order. By allowing only two members into the cult at a time, the dark side would remain concentrated within those two beings, instead of legions of ineffective warriors. When the apprentice learned all they could from the master, it was their duty to kill the master and take an apprentice of their own, in order to ensure the continuing strength of the cult. As such, the Rule of Two embraced the idea of the rule of the strong. The small number of Sith allowed the Order to remain hidden for a millennium.I\n\n\u2022 The rule of one\n\nRule of One\n's vision for the One Sith]]\nThe Rule of One was the guiding code of the One Sith. Created by Darth Krayt after the collapse of the Order of the Sith Lords, it embraced the ideals of the ancient Sith, wherein there was a single Dark Lord of the Sith who led many lesser Sith Lords, along with other minions and acolytes. The \"One\" represented the Sith Order itself, a unified and cohesive group of Sith who restrained from infighting and were fanatically obedient to Dark Lord Krayt. The practice of one apprentice per master was retained, however there were many masters. Also retained was the practice of slaying a master once an apprentices training was complete, however this was not done to continue the rule of the strong, but rather to show ones faith and devotion to the Sith cause.\nThe Order was considered heretical by Darth Bane, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Andeddu, who voiced their opinions via holocron. Some, including Darth Nihl and Cade Skywalker believed that the lack of a line of succession would cause the One Sith to collapse if Darth Krayt were ever killed, though upon Darth Krayt's final death control passed to Darth Nihl and the One Sith continued to follow their Lord loyally.\nA similar yet different philosophy existed under Sidiouss running of the Order. The main difference is that, while it does maintain that only one Sith lord (in this case, Sidious) actually matters, it otherwise superficially held to the Rule of Two.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Origins\n\nTales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 2]]\nwere one of the three original Sith subspecies.]]\nBefore the founding of the Jedi Order and the discovery of the dark side, the Sith species evolved on Korriban. The Sith species began to coalesce as a society some time prior to roughly 100,000 BBY, when their culture and religion developed. They were able to fight off a Killik incursion circa 30,000 BBY,The Essential Atlas presumably resulting in a Killik Sith taking up residence on Alsakan, although how this Sith was able to break from the hive-mind is unknown. Around 28,000 BBY, legendary Sith King Adas ruled his people and their Empire. Having ruled as a warlord for some time, he was able to unite the peoples of Korriban, and was pronounced the Sith'ari, or overlord. Adas's reign lasted for several centuries, ending only after the invasion of Korriban by the Rakata of the Infinite Empire.\nInitially friendly, the Rakata taught Adas how to create holocrons, and lent their knowledge of space travel to the Sith. However, it soon became apparent that the Rakata intended to take the Sith people as slaves, and Adas launched a war to rid his world of them. After driving them from Korriban, he hijacked several of their ships and used them to spread the Sith species to Ziost, Tund, and Malachor V, and was eventually successful in driving the Rakata from Sith space entirely. However, the victory cost him his life. The Rakata left behind a Star Map on Korriban, and possibly the origin for the Darth title.Darth Bane: Rule of Two\nThe death of Adas threw Korriban into civil war, with many different Sith scrambling for power. The horrors of this war continued during the second civil war of 7000 BBY, when Dathka Graush destroyed most of the cities on Korriban. The Sith people moved their center of government and culture to the world of Ziost, and left Korriban, with that planet becoming a tomb world for their fallen leaders. A millennium prior to this, in 8000 BBY, humans and aliens escaping the oppression of the Tapani Dynasty arrived through the Stygian Caldera, possibly accounting for the Sith influence upon the future Mecrosa Order in later centuries.\nIn 25,053 BBY, elsewhere in the galaxy, the Galactic Republic was forming.The Galactic Republic On the planet Tython, scholars, scientists, warriors, and religious figures met to discuss an anomalous energy field present in the galaxy that would become known as the Force.\nIn these discussions, several individuals advocated the use of Bogan, what would become known as the dark side, to gain power. The followers of the light, who used the Force to gain knowledge, rejected this idea and defeated the followers of Bogan in the Force Wars of Tython.\nFollowing the conflict, the victors established the Jedi Order, a group of warrior-monks who followed the light side. Around 24,500 BBY, a libertarian Jedi named Xendor turn to the teachings of the dark side and left the order, along with many other students calling themselves the Legions of Lettow who lived to their passions and rejected order and structure. The resulting conflict, known as the First Great Schism, ended with Xendor dead and the Legions of Lettow defeated by the Jedi Order.The Essential Guide to WarfareJedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\nare exiled.]]\nThe dark side would not have a strong hold until 7000 BBY, when another group of Jedi left the Order to follow the dark path. These Jedi used the Force to bend life to serve their purposes, creating new species, or fearsome, but loyal servants. It was rumored that their ambition went even further: they wanted to defeat death itself. These practices were looked upon with fear and horror by other Jedi, deeming it as abomination to the Force. Feeling their power was threatened, the rogue Jedi sought supporters within the Order, but were turned away. Arguments for their cause turned to conflicts, and these Jedi were exiled from the Order. Taking their teachings with them, they became known as Dark Jedi, and launched a war against the Jedi Order that would come to be known as the Hundred-Year Darkness.\nUsing alchemically altered soldiers and twisting living things into horrible beasts the Dark Jedi's war lasted a hundred years. It was during this war that the Leviathans was created, along with many other monstrosities. Eventually, the Dark Jedi were defeated at the Battle of Corbos as a result of infighting and Jedi bombing. As punishment, the surviving Dark Jedi were gathered by Republic forces and loaded aboard unarmed galleons. Stripped of their weapons, the Exiles were to be sent into the unknown regions of space to contemplate the error of their ways.\n\n\u2022 Creation and early history\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords\nXoXaan and Karness Muur being greeted by the Sith people]]\nThe Exiles traveled the stars towards an unknown destination. They emerged from hyperspace above Korriban, where they were greeted by the Sith people. The Exiles, who included XoXaan, Remulus Dreypa, Ajunta Pall, Sorzus Syn and Karness Muur, shocked the natives with their dark side abilities and were proclaimed Jen'jidai, meaning Dark Jedi in the language of the Sith. The Jen'jidai forged an alliance with the Sith rulers second in command and used that relationship to overthrow and kill the King, with Ajunta Pall beheading him and claiming the throne as the descendant of the legendary King Adas.Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side Declaring themselves as living gods, the Dark Jedi enslaved the Sith, who soon worshipped them as such. Adopting the title \"Lords of the Sith\" and their ruler came to be known as the Jenari, or Dark Lord of the Sith, they wore elaborated clothes to awe their subjects and commanded them to built vast temples and tombs.Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia\nShortly after settling on Korriban, however a splinter group of exiles, led by Remulus Dreypa, returned to Republic space to enact their vengeance, but they were intercepted by a Jedi patrol. The Jedi pursued those Sith across the galaxy, until both factions crash-landed on the planet Kesh. After a period of fighting, the Jedi and Dreypas followers made peace and formed a new organization called the Doomed, which strived to achieve balance between the light and the dark sides of the force.Star Wars: Lost Tribe of the Sith \u2014 Spiral'\nPall began remaking the Sith Empire into a new Imperial regime lead by the Sith Lords instead of the Kings of the Sith people. Over time the Jen'jidai and the Sith interbred to make the two groups indistinguishable from one another, and the Empire continued to be lead by a succession of Dark Lords, including Tulak Hord. Deceased Dark Lords were entombed in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. Their tombs were filled with the treasures they had accumulated during their life, as well as strong dark side energies and their slaves. Often the tomb would also house the spirit of the Dark Lord himself, who remained attached to his body and possessions through the Force.\n, the final resting place for many Dark Lords]]\nDuring their reign, the Sith Lords fought for power, challenging one another with new and innovative weapons created through the dark side. One such weapon was the Muur Talisman, which was created by the Sith Lord and former Dark Jedi Karness Muur. Muur was an expert in Sith alchemy and may have helped to create the Leviathan during the Hundred-Year Darkness. His talisman had the power to transform humans into alchemically engineered monsters called Rakghouls, whom Muur would be able to command. When he discovered that aliens and Force-sensitives were unaffected, Muur created the Rakghoul plague, which would spread his monsters to those immune to the talismans power. Eventually, a rival Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa created an oubliette which would contain Muur, his talisman, and the plague. Muur was killed before he could be captured and his talisman was lost, only to end up on Taris several millennia later by unknown means.\nEventually, a legendary Sith half-breed named Marka Ragnos defeated Sith Council member Simus in combat and rose to power, claiming the title of Dark Lord of the Sith.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 3 His little-documented but long reign was known to have been during the \"Golden Age\" of the Sith Empire. During this time the Empire experienced relative stability and encompassed at least 120 planets, including Arkania, Malachor V, Thule, and Vjun. By this time the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire believed each other to just be myths.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 4\n\n\u2022 The Great Hyperspace War and Fall of the Sith Empire\n\nNaga Sadow]]\nand Naga Sadow duel during the Funeral of Marka Ragnos.]]\nThe Golden Age came to an abrupt halt with the death of Marka Ragnos. Control of the Empire fell to the Sith Council, which was divided over who should succeed Ragnos as Dark Lord. Two contenders rose to the forefront- Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh. Sadow was known as an expansionist in contrast to Kresshs reputation as an isolationist. Originally confined to arguments and debates within the council, the disagreement exploded violently during the Funeral of Marka Ragnos. The funeral procession was led by Kressh, with Sadow conspicuously missing during the ceremonies. Much to Kresshs chagrin, Sadow made his entrance in the middle of Kresshs eulogy for the fallen Dark Lord. The enraged Kressh demanded Sadow leave, however his rival instead claimed the mantle of Dark Lord. Kressh responded by claiming the title as well, and the two entered into a duel at the foot of Ragnoss tomb. The fierce battle was interrupted by the ghost of Marka Ragnos, who implored the two to stop fighting and pick their battles carefully, for the Sith Empire he had helped build was in the balance.\nFollowing Ragnoss departure, the two Sith Lords prepared to reenter combat, however they were once again interrupted, this time by the arrival of wayward hyperspace explorers Gav and Jori Daragon. The sibling explorers claimed to hail from the Galactic Republic, and were quickly taken into custody and imprisoned on the Sith capital world of Ziost. Setting aside their conflict for a time, Kressh and Sadow rejoined the Council, which was debating the fate of the Daragons. Unsurprisingly, the two disagreed on this as well. Kressh, under the belief that they were harbingers of a Republic invasion, called for their immediate execution, while Sadow saw them as a pathway to expansion, by way of conquering their Republic. The council was yet again split between the two, however Ludo Kressh was able to win with the support of the council majority. Simus, a former contender for the title of Dark Lord and ally of Naga Sadows, went to inform the Daragons of their impending execution. However, Naga Sadow had no intention of following the will of the Council, and killed Simus with weapons confiscated from the Daragons ship, the Starbreaker 12, making it appear as though it was a Republic attack. He freed the Daragons and hid them away in his fortress on Khar Shian, while reporting Simuss death back to the Council. Feigning shock, he claimed that the apparent Republic aggression and rescue of the Daragons required retaliation, something he had foreseen. The Council almost unanimously elected him Dark Lord, with the exception of Kressh, who claimed the title for himself and stormed out of the meeting. Shortly afterwards, Sadow staged yet another Republic attack by stealing the Starbreaker 12 from impound on Ziost. He would need the ship to return Jori Daragon to the Republic, thereby leading the Dark Lord to his next frontier. The human female was being kept in Sadow's decoy fortress on Khar Delba, while her brother remained on Khar Shian to be trained in the ways of the dark side by Sadow.\n]]\nIn the process Sadow hoped to rid the Empire of Kressh, and so planted evidence on Ziost that would point to back to himself. Kressh acted predictably and attacked Sadows decoy fortress on Khar Delba. Sadow had prepared for the battle and stationed his fleet on the dark side of the moon Khar Shian. He attacked an unsuspecting Kressh, whose commanders were betrayed by their crews. Kressh, knowing he could not win the battle, fled, leaving Naga Sadow as the undisputed ruler of the Sith. During the battle he allowed Jori Daragon to escape with the Starbreaker 12, which was wired with a homing beacon.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 5 After seemingly killing Kressh,Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 1 Sadow gathered his forces for an invasion of the Republic, initiating a conflict known as the Great Hyperspace War. Sadow even used Sith Lords as generals in his powerful army, including Shar DakhanTales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 2 and Garu. The Republic, unwilling to believe Jori Daragons story of impending war, was unprepared for the onslaught and was initially overwhelmed by the invasion. Sadows warships and warriors spread throughout Republic space, attacking many worlds simultaneously, while Sadow himself aided by using battle meditation from within his Sith Meditation Sphere. Stationed above the star Primus Goluud along with his flagship, Sadow presented the Republic with a seemingly unbeatable enemy. Empress Teta of Koros Major was the only Republic official prepared for the assault,Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 3 and her forces beat back Sith attacks on Cinnagar and Kirrek, and were able to pursue them back to Primus Goluud, where Sadow activated a superweapon within his flagship, the Corsair, that caused the star to supernova. The explosion killed Gav Daragon and forced the Sith to retreat back to their Empire, with Tetas forces in pursuit.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 4\nReturning to Korriban in defeat, Sadows forces were met with those of Ludo Kressh. After feigning his demise, Kressh had remained within the Empire, gaining support while Sadow lead the invasion of the Republic. The two fleets clashed, initiating the first battle of Korriban. When it appeared Kressh would win the battle against Sadows already wounded forces, the Dark Lord ordered that one of his vessels ram Kresshs flag ship. The impact killed the rival Sith Lord and ended the battle, Sadows final conflict with Ludo Kressh. Sadow was unable to enjoy his victory however, as Empress Tetas forces emerged from hyperspace moments later, crippling Sadows ship and decimating his forces. Hoping to escape to Yavin Prime, Sadow fled the battle, and was believed killed in the Denarii Nova he created with the Corsair. As the remains of the Sith Empire crumbled behind him, Sadow and his remaining Massassi warriors landed on Yavin 4, where construction began on the Temple of Fire.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 5 With the Republic navy entering Sith space, the Sith became desperate. Shar Dakhan as acting Dark Lord of the Sith ordered his Massassi pilots to ram invading Republic ships. This drove the Republic back for a while, however the Republic's triumph was inevitable. They destroyed most of the Sith Empire.\nHowever, this was not the end of the Empire. Various Sith survivors fled to different parts of the galaxy. Several Sith fled to Thule, where they would remain for generations, waiting for their revenge on the Jedi and the Republic. They established a military dictatorship, ruled by an oligarchy of eight generals. Several of the remaining Sith Lords sought refuge on Ambria, where they hid among the planets dark side energies in order to avoid persecution. They stayed on the planet for many years, until passing into the Force themselves, leaving yet more dark side spirits on Ambria. On Kesh, the descendants of a crashed ship the Omen' survived and formed the Lost Tribe of Sith. Several Sith sects survived on Vjun and passed on their teachings secretly through the families. On Tund, the Sith refugees eventually became mere charlatans known as the Sorcerers of Tund. As a result of an unstable hyperdrive, the Sith starship Harbinger traveled to the future to the year 41 ABY. Finally, one Sith Lord took his forces and retreated to the Unknown Regions where they would bide their time, and wait. This hidden Sith Empire still held on to Malachor V as a teaching center. Sadow was unable to rebuild the Empire after the war as he had hoped to do on Yavin, and so placed himself in suspended animation within one of his temples.\n\n\u2022 The rise of Freedon Nadd and conflict on Onderon\n\nTales of the Jedi Companion\nlingered for centuries after his death as a Force ghost.]]\nWhile Naga Sadow remained in stasis, the Sith Order survived in obscurity on Yavin 4 and the Jedi and Republic once again believed their enemy defeated. Around six-hundred years following the fall of the Sith Empire, a young human began training at Odan-Urrs Great Jedi Library on Ossus. The young Jedi named Freedon Nadd impressed his masters with his connection to the Force and eagerness to find harmony. The attention from his masters caused arrogance in Nadd that lead him to believe he would soon be elevated to knighthood. To his surprise, he was passed over for knighthood, causing him to become resentful and conflicted. Nadd sought out Jedi Master Matta Tremayne in the hopes that she might be able to show him what he must do in order to become a Knight. In a test for the young Jedis humility, Tremayne ignored him until his anger burst out and he turned to leave. Only then did she acknowledge him, challenging him to a lightsaber duel. The two engaged one another, and Freedons anger rose. Sensing this, Tremayne deactivated her lightsaber, exposing herself to attack from Nadd. Unable to stop himself, Freedons saber cut through Tremayne, killing her. Initially regretful, Nadd soon became infuriated as he began to believe it was all a ploy to get him removed from the Order. Abandoning the Jedi, he fled Ossus craving revenge.\nNadd first traveled to the heart of the now defunct Sith Empire in the hopes that the dark side teachings there would lead him to the revenge he desired. He arrived on the world of Ashas Ree, where the ancient Sith Lord Garu had hidden the Holocron of King Adas. Learning from the holocron, Nadd studied deeper into the dark side and traveled deeper into old Sith Space. Eventually the he came upon the fourth moon of Yavin and the sleeping Dark Lord Naga Sadow. Sadow, finally recognizing Nadd as one who could restore the power of the Sith, awakened and consented to train the fallen Jedi in the ways of the Sith. The training lasted for a time, however before it was complete, Nadds confidence in his own abilities once again took control. Believing himself strong enough for the title of Dark Lord, Nadd slew Sadow and seized the mantle. Sadows death marked the end of the Sith species, as the remaining Massassi on Yavin had become primitive mutations of themselves following centuries of experimentation at the hands of Sadow.\n, King of Onderon and descendant of Freedon Nadd]]\nAfter gathering what relics he could from the Massassi Temples, Nadd left Yavin 4 behind and traveled to Onderon, an Inner Rim world. Onderon was a densely forested planet home to large beasts and a single, heavily guarded city, Iziz. The city was surrounded by walls and defense towers used to keep out the beasts of the jungle, which the people of Iziz had fought for centuries. Nadd arrived on the planet and wowed the populace with his dark side magic and Force powers. Much like the exiled dark Jedi millennia before on Korriban, Nadd proclaimed himself the ruler of the people in Iziz and King of Onderon. Iziz's law and order was based on the policy of banishing dissidents and \"criminals\" from the walled city, condemning them to death by the animals of Onderon. Eventually, the banished criminals organized themselves into the \"Beast Riders\" after taming the beasts of the jungle, such as the Drexl, Cannok, and Boma. The Riders continually attacked the city they had once called home in a centuries-long conflict known as the Beast Wars. Nadd was able to elevate himself to a near-God status with the people by repelling attacks by the Riders by use of the Force. Although his reign was oppressive, the Onderonians accepted his teachings and embraced his dark side influence. Nadd eventually died and was buried beneath the Iziz palace in his tomb. His bloodline continued to rule Onderon, and although he was dead, Iziz was still saturated with the dark side presence of Freedon Nadd.\n\n\u2022 The Onderonian Monarchy\n\nTales of the Jedi audio drama]]\nHis descendants would continue his oppressive rule as the kings and queens of Onderon, and call upon his lingering spirit for power and dark side teachings. His tomb beneath Iziz became a strong nexus of dark side power and his collections of artifacts became treasures to those seeking his dark side strength. Eventually the Dark Lords descendant Ommin took the throne and trained extensively with Freedon Nadds spirit. The two also seduced Amanoa into marrying the King and training in the Sith arts. Nadd played the two against one another hoping the competition would reveal the stronger of the two, and thereby the one worthy of becoming the vessel of his resurrection. Although Ommin became extremely capable in the dark side, his power in the Force caused him to lose control over his own body, and the King became confined to a mechanical exoskeleton that also served as a life-support system.\nAmanoa surrenders completely to Freedon Nadd's power.]]\nUnfit for the public eye, he handed control of Iziz to his wife, Queen Amanoa, who abandoned her studies with Nadd to focus on the affairs of state. While the people of Onderon believed Ommin dead, he hid beneath Iziz in his lair, continuing his dark side study, collecting Sith artifacts, and gathering an cult of followers calling themselves Naddists. Ommin and his wife were both too embroiled with their own interests to take direct command of the cult, and so their proxies, Warb Null and Novar, acted in their stead. The armor-clad Warb Null was a young Force-sensitive who had been seduced to the dark side by a Sith spirit, while Novar had been an apprentice to Ommin and Amanoa following his tenure as Ommin's personal aide.\nEventually, Freedon Nadd came to realize that neither the King nor the Queen would be fit to serve as the agent of his resurrection. Ommin had become far too weak under the pall of the dark side and Amanoa was no longer focused on the Sith. Unwilling to surrender, Nadd attempted one last time to pull the Queen back into the grip of the Sith, appearing before her and warning her not to allow the still ongoing Beast Wars to fully erupt, as it would result in her destruction. Although Nadd hoped this would scare the Queen back into her dark side studies, Amanoa took an entirely different direction and requested the aide of the Jedi Order to end the centuries-long conflict. The Jedi agreed and sent Master Arca Jeths apprentices to Iziz to begin negotiations. Hiding the taint of the dark side from the young Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma, Cay Qel-Droma, and Tott Doneeta, Amanoa requested their assistance in defeating the Beast Riders, who kidnapped her and Ommins daughter, Galia, shortly after the Jedi arrival. Soon, Amanoa learned that her daughter consented to be married to the leader of the Beast Riders, Oron Kira, and hoped to settle the war peacefully. Having no interest in a peaceful settlement, the enraged Queen revealed her dark side allegiance to her enemies, surrounding Iziz in a palpable darkness. During the ensuing battle, the Naddist army fought to defend the Queen as she retreated to Freedon Nadds tomb beneath the palace. The Naddists fought valiantly against the Beast Riders for a time under Amanoas dark side influence, however the arrival of Master Arca Jeth broke their advantage. Jeth was able to follow the Queen into the Dark Lord's tomb and dispel his dark energy, killing Queen Amanoa in the process.\nand Satal Keto to safety.]]\nThe death of the Queen and the supposed dispersion of Nadds dark energy did little to pull Onderon out of darkness however. Even after Galia took the throne and the fighting ended, there was still a noticeable dark side aura throughout Iziz. The decision was made by the Jedi to exhume the remains of Freedon Nadd and bury both him and Queen Amanoa on Onderons jungle moon of Dxun, where their presence could no longer corrupt future rulers. News of his wifes death at the hands of the Jedi and the end of the Beast Wars eventually reached King Ommin, still hiding beneath Iziz. Prepared to reveal himself once more, the frail king had the dark side slave, Warb Null, lead the Naddist cult into battle on the streets of Iziz during the Queens funeral procession. The dark-siders tunneled up into the surface of the city and ambushed the Jedi. Null fought them off and the Naddists captured the sarcophagi of both deceased monarchs, quickly returning them to Ommins underground sanctuary. Shortly after the battle, Ommin, empowered by the spirit of Freedon Nadd, distracted Arca Jeth long enough for the King to seize the Jedi Master and flee with him deep into the tunnels. Jeths Padawan, Ulic Qel-Droma, was unable to save his master from abduction, as he had entered a duel with Warb Null. The duel ended quickly however, with Null dead.\nMeanwhile, on Koros Major, Satal and Aleema Keto, cousins and royal heirs of the Tetan Monarchy, had formed the Krath secret society with their friends. The group researched the Sith and their ancient Empire which instigated the Great Hyperspace war centuries before, and became so consumed with the history that the two decided to take a trip to Coruscant, where the Galactic Museum had prepared an exhibit featuring artifacts from the Sith Empire. At the behest of Aleema, Satal stole a Sith spellbook from the exhibit, The Dark Lords of the Sith, however neither of the two could read the contents, as it was written in ancient Sith glyphs. As the fighting continued on Onderon for days, word of the conflict spread across the galaxy via the HoloNet. A report of the Sith-worshipping dark side army was read on a newscast, which caught the attention of the cousins. The two resolved to travel to Onderon in search of an individual who could translate the text for them.\nAlthough the battle on Onderon was progressing well for the Naddists, the Jedi soon received reinforcements in the form of a Republic battle group and five additional Jedi from Ossus. One of these Jedi, Nomi Sunrider, was able to turn the tide with her battle meditation ability. The fighting, which had been confined to the jungle stronghold of the Beast Riders for two days, now returned to Iziz. As the streets once again became embroiled in war, the Keto cousins dropped out of hyperspace, right in the middle of the war zone. Ignoring warnings from the Republic fleet in orbit, the two descended towards the city and were shot down by crossfire. Aleema and Satal survived the crash and were able to contact King Ommin. He gifted the aspiring darksiders with a Sith amulet which granted them the power to read the Sith spellbook. In return, he asked for the opportunity to transcribe the spellbook for his own collection. As the trio completed their deal, Ommin introduced the Ketos to his latest addition to his collection: Arca Jeth. Ommin planned to torture the Jedi Master enough that he would be unable to resist the temptation of the dark side. However, it was at this moment that the Jedi task force in the city was able to penetrate Ommins stronghold and ambush his defenders. As Satal and Aleema panicked and fled deeper into the tunnels beneath Iziz, the King fought the Jedi, but to no avail. Ulic Qel-Droma was able to slice through Ommins exoskeleton, incapacitating him. The King begged for the assistance of Freedon Nadd, however the Dark Lord had decided that the Ketos showed more promise than Ommin. Nadds spirit guided the two Krath founders to safety and returned to tell Ommin that he had forsaken him, and the Jedi that their victory would be short-lived. Before departing Iziz, Nadd prophesized on the fate of Ulic Qel-Droma, claiming he was destined to become one of the great Sith Lords.\nWith Ommins death, and the end of the Freedon Nadd Uprising, Onderon was finally free of Nadds dark shadow. The bodies of King Ommin, Queen Amanoa, and Freedon Nadd were all moved to Dxun, into a tomb of Mandalorian iron, not to be disturbed again. Aleema and Satal, armed with new knowledge and artifacts from Iziz, returned to Empress Teta to plan their ascension.\n\n\u2022 The Great Sith War\n\nTales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 6]]\nand Vodo-Siosk Baas prepare for a training duel on the plains of Dantooine.]]\nWith the Naddist Revolt crushed, Freedon Nadd's dream of a second Sith Golden Age was halted once again. However, a new opportunity would present itself in the form of the rising Krath cult in the Empress Teta system and the young Jedi Exar Kun.\nExar Kun was the pupil of Krevaaki Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas along with the Cathar Jedi Crado and Sylvar. Kun was extremely talented in the Force and, much like Freedon Nadd centuries earlier, developed an arrogance that led him to believe he was worthy of receiving special teachings. Becoming engrossed with the idea that he could research Sith teachings and powers, yet remain uncorrupted by the dark side, Kun began to delve into forbidden Sith holocrons on the Jedi world of Dantooine. During a lightsaber training session with his master and fellow students, Kun defeated Crado easily. Following Crados defeat, Master Baas instructed Sylvar to enter a duel with Kun. Exar taunted Sylvar with claims that nonhumans were inept and unworthy, angering her, and in retribution, she struck the human with her claws, scarring and infuriating him. Kun attacked her viciously and nearly killed her when Vodo-Siosk Baas stepped in and stopped Kuns saber with his walking staff. In an attempt to teach Exar Kun a lesson in strength, Baas challenged his wayward apprentice to a duel and gained the upper hand quickly, despite the immense odds of walking stick versus lightsaber. Kun was able to defeat his master with aid from Crado, who threw Exar his lightsaber during the duel. Victorious, Kun declared himself a Jedi Knight and departed Dantooine to search for the secrets of the Sith.\nforces overwhelm the Empress Teta system during their coup.]]\nKun followed his curiosity to Onderon, where the fighting had just ended. He learned here that the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd had recently been interred on Dxun, and traveled to the moon in search of answers. Kun broke into the sealed tomb and encountered the spirit of Nadd, who encouraged the young man to continue his search on the ancient Sith burial world of Korriban. As Kun left Dxun for old Sith space, Aleema and Satal Keto, who had also recently paid Onderon a visit, were setting their plan for domination in motion on Koros Major.\nThe two Krath founders, after having used the late King Ommins artifacts and the spirit of Freedon Nadd to become adept in Sith sorcery, traveled to the Tetan carbonite smelter above Koros where Lord Keto and Lady Magda Keto, rulers of the Empress Teta system and parents of Satal and Aleema, were being given a tour. The two were escorted by the royal tutor Korus, whose tongue was transformed into an Adegan eel by the children. This bewildered Lord Keto, who attempted to call for help, but his guards swords were transformed into snakes that began to attack their wielders. Helpless, Lord and Lady Keto accepted defeat at the hands of their children and continued their tour, now guiding the new Emperor Satal and Empress Aleema of the Teta system. The group entered a smelting chamber, and the new rulers of Teta had the former rulers tied above vats of molten carbonite and lowered into them. With Lord and Lady Keto dead and the Tetan government under their control, Satal and Aleema took up residence in the Iron Citadel in Cinnagar. The worlds of Empress Teta quickly fell in line behind the Krath, all except for Koros Major itself. Initiating the Krath Holy Crusade, the Ketos launched an assault against their own capital world, hoping to bring it in line.\n\n\u2022 The Krath Holy Crusade\n\nTales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith' 1]]\n's illusions attack the Republic Navy at the Battle of Koros Major.]]\nAs the Ketos prepared to crush the resistance on Koros Major, word of the struggle and Krath usurpation reached the Republic capital of Coruscant. Jedi Master Arca Jeth petitioned the Republic leadership to send aid to the resistance fighters and help defeat the Krath, as the dark side cult reminded the Jedi too much of the Naddists recently defeated on Onderon. The Republic complied, and a battle group to relieve the resistance fighters was organized, lead by Jedi Knights Nomi Sunrider and Ulic Qel-Droma. However, when the Republic fleet arrived at Koros Major, the battle was already in progress, with Krath warships attacking the planet. As Qel-Droma ordered his ships into battle positions, Aleema and Satal began their counter-attack. Aleema utilized Sith magic to conjure illusions of space grazers which headed directly at the Republic fleet, causing the officers to panic and their ships to scatter. Nomi Sunrider was able to see through the illusion and refocus the fleet, however the Krath decided that the battle would require both the Force and physical military might, and so ordered wings of Chaos fighters to initiate suicide runs on the Republic vessels. As the fighters closed the distance between the fleets, Aleema conjured an illusion of additional wings of Chaos fighters to confuse and overwhelm the Republic ships. Sunrider again saw through the illusion and was able to block Aleema's ghost ships from interfering in the battle, but there were still many real fighters that collided with Republic vessels. The Republic fleet was crippled and forced to retreat with a severely injured Qel-Droma, while the Krath were left to complete their conquest of Koros. The Battle of Empress Teta was a complete success for the Krath, and marked the beginning of the wider Great Sith War.\non Deneba]]\nBecause of the massive losses over Koros Major, the Jedi leadership decided it was time for an assembly to be called in order to discuss the Krath threat and other gathering shadows. Krath intelligence agents discovered that the grand convocation was to be held on Deneba, and Satal planned for a direct assault against the Jedi there. As thousands of Jedi vessels descended upon Deneba, Satal was able to sneak a Krath warship among them, hiding in orbit. Meanwhile, light-years away on Korriban, Exar Kun was exploring the planet once inhabited by the Dark Lords of the Sith. Guided by Freedon Nadds spirit, Kun became trapped and injured beneath rubble during a cave-in within an ancient tomb. The cave-in was designed by Nadd as a test for Kun, who would need to touch the dark side in order to survive. Initially fearful, Kun reached out through the Force for his former Master Baas on Deneba, who attempted to help his pupil. Freedon Nadd refused to allow this to happen however, and blocked Vodos attempts at aiding Kun. Near death and running out of options, Kun embraced the dark side and freed himself. Kun's anger and malice healed his broken body and sent ripples through the Force that greatly disturbed the Jedi assembly, however Baas accepted that he could no longer help the young man. Kun, still under the belief he could use both the dark and light side without consequence, left Korriban on a course for Yavin 4, where Nadd claimed his training would be completed.\nOn Deneba the Jedi debated over how to best combat the dark side and it's followers, and after hearing proposals and arguments from Ulic Qel-Droma and others, the convocation took a short recess. Just before the conclave could resume, Satal set his plan in motion. The Krath warship in orbit above the planet launched a large number of escape pods, each filled with Krath war droids. Catching the Jedi unaware, the droids were able to kill many of them in the initial stages of the attack. In conjunction with the war droid assault, the service droids who had been serving the Jedi during the convocation also attacked their masters, having been sabotaged by Krath spies prior to the arrival of the Jedi. Although all the droids were destroyed at the Battle of Deneba, many Jedi were killed, including Arca Jeth. The death of his master caused Ulic Qel-Droma to plan a mission to destroy the Krath from within, a strategy frowned upon by many other Jedi, including his late master.\nUlic traveled to the Empress Teta system and cut off contact with the rest of the Order. He was quickly able to convince Aleema that he had fallen from the Jedi way and become sympathetic to the Krath, however Satal was not so trusting. He had the young Jedi imprisoned and tortured which caused Ulic to begin a journey towards the dark side. Satal eventually came to trust Ulic, and Qel-Droma was instated as a warlord of the Krath. Fearing the worst after months with no contact, Ulics lover Nomi Sunrider planned a mission to rescue Ulic from Cinnagar. Whe she arrived however, she found that Ulic still wished to maintain his cover and did nothing as Nomi was sentenced to death. He attempted to explain himself to her via a secret message that was intercepted by Satal. Not knowing Ulics plan, Nomi escaped her prison but before she could depart, she was confronted by Satal, who was then confronted by Ulic Qel-Droma. Ulic had recently learned from Aleema that it was Satal who ordered the attack on Deneba, and in search of revenge for the late Arca Jeth, Ulic attacked Satal. During the ensuing struggle, Ulic killed Satal in a fit of anger and succumbed to the dark side, Ketos intent from the start. Although Nomi and other Jedi attempted to help him, he attacked them as well and drove them off while he stayed on Koros Major. Ulic soon took Satals place at Aleema's side was awarded with a rare Sith amulet while Nomi began to plan yet another mission to rescue Ulic.\nAcross the galaxy, Exar Kun was also continuing his descent into darkness. Much like Ulic, who believed he could conquer the dark side from within yet still remain true to the light, Exar believed he could use the power of the dark yet remain uncorrupted by it. Freedon Nadd, whose spirit still guided Kun, was intent on proving him wrong. As Kun arrived on Yavin 4, he was confronted by the primitive and savage Massassi people who easily captured the Dark Jedi, as Exar was still unwilling to fully give into the power of the dark side. On the verge of death, Kun was again visited by Freedon Nadd. Nadd once again told him that the only way to survive was to embrace the dark side and Exar complied, seizing a Sith amulet from a Massassi priest and using its power to free himself and kill his captors. Exar had fully accepted the Sith ways, much to Freedon Nadds delight, who immediately demanded that Kun get to work on the creation of a new body for the long-dead Dark Lord to inhabit, a task both Ommin and Amanoa had failed on Onderon. Exar had grown annoyed with Nadd however, and used his newfound power to destroy his spirit once and for all. In his last moments, Nadd visited Ulic Qel-Droma and Aleema Keto in Cinnagar and warned them of Kuns rising power. Freedon Nadd, plague of the Jedi and father to the Naddists and Krath, was gone. Exar Kun, free from Nadd's command, went about enslaving the remaining Massassi on Yavin 4 and searching for threats to his power. He identified two darksiders on Koros Major, Ulic and Aleema, and set out to kill them.\nKun arrived in Cinnagar directly after a Jedi assault lead by Nomi Sunrider was beaten back by Qel-Droma. Exar confronted Ulic and Aleema and quickly incapacitated the Tetan Empress. Qel-Droma was much more of a challenge however, and the two dark Jedi dueled fiercely. The duel was short-lived though, as Exar and Ulics Sith amulets began to glow with dark energy, enticing the spirit of Marka Ragnos to appear as it had during the duel between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh. This time however, the combatants yielded to the spirit and stopped their duel to heed Ragnoss words. The ancient Sith Lord proclaimed that Exar Kun was to be the new Dark Lord of the Sith, while Ulic Qel-Doma was to become his apprentice. The two were branded with Sith tattoos on their foreheads to signify their new allegiance. With the inception of the new Sith Lords, the order was once again revived, the first time since the death of Freedon Nadd centuries before.\n\n\u2022 The Brotherhood of the Sith\n\nTales of the Jedi \u2013 The Sith War 3]]\nOdan-Urr's death at the hands of Exar Kun, the new Dark Lord of the Sith]]\nAllied with Aleeemas Krath armies, the two Sith Lords set out to plan the final destruction of the Jedi and the Republic. Using the Dark Reaper,they inflicted near-genocidal casualties on worlds such as Raxus Prime. Exar used Sith alchemy to create Terentateks, large creatures with a thirst for Jedi blood. Ulic was also able to make an alliance with Mandalore the Indomitable on Kuar, and with the new addition of Mandalorian soldiers to their forces, the Sith overwhelmed the Republic defenders at Foerost. While the Krath and Mandalorian armies under Ulics command terrorized the galaxy, Exar went about building a following of darksiders for the Sith Lords to command. He traveled to Ossus, where he gave an impassioned speech to the Jedi students there, claiming their masters were withholding knowledge and power from them. Many students, including Crado, left Ossus for Yavin 4, where they would become the apprentices of Kun, however before Kun himself left, he planned on retrieving the Sith holocron possessed by Odan-Urr, the ancient Jedi hero of the Great Hyperspace War. Kun confronted Odan-Urr and killed him, taking the holocron for himself and claiming the ancient Master declared Exar a Jedi Master directly before his death.\nOn Yavin 4, his students expressed doubt about the path they had started on after sensing the dark taint of the moon. In response, Kun destroyed Odan-Urr's Sith holocron, releasing the spirits trapped inside which then possessed the doubtful Jedi. Reassured by the dark spirits now controlling their actions, the Jedi students trained with Kun in the dark arts and were eventually convinced by him that the last thing standing in the way of another Sith Golden Age was their former Jedi Masters. The students left Yavin to hunt down and kill their masters in an incredibly successful strike known as the Sith uprising. Meanwhile, Ulic had grown ambitious and arrogant with his new Mandalorian army and decided to strike the heart of the Republic, Coruscant. Although the plan was frowned upon by Kun, Ulic went ahead with the attack and lead Mandalore and Aleema into battle alongside their armies. Aleema, tired of sharing power over the Krath with Ulic, ordered a retreat while Qel-Droma was attacking the Republic war room alone. Abandoned, Ulic was eventually defeated by the Jedi on Coruscant and put on trial.\n]]\nUlics trial was presided over by the Republic Supreme Chancellor and he was found guilty on all charges. As he was sentenced to death, Exar Kun strode into the Senate Hall where the trial was being held. Immobilizing the senators and executing the Supreme Chancellor, Kun freed his apprentice only to be confronted by his former master, Vodo-Siosk Baas. Kun used his new weapon, a double-bladed lightsaber to overpower and murder Baas, who claimed he would one day return to defeat his apprentice. Kun and Qel-Droma departed Coruscant to continue their war after again proclaiming the dominance of the Sith. Upon Ulics return to command, Mandalore informed him of Aleema's treachery at the Battle of Coruscant and the Sith apprentice began planning for revenge.\nThe next stage of the war centered around the attack on Kemplex Nine. Ulic hoped to use the battle as a trap for Aleema, while Exar planned to trick the Krath Sorceress into destroying the Cron Cluster, a group of ten closely packed stars, which would result in the destruction of a different target. Exar armed Aleema with the Corsair, the ancient flagship of Naga Sadow discovered on Yavin 4. Kun taught her how to use its Sith magic to rip the cores from stars, but neglected to tell her that it would cause a supernova the ship could not protect her from. Aleema and Crado were to take the ship and lead the assault on Kemplex Nine, however Aleema was overly eager to use her new weapon. After destroying the Republic jump-station that was their target, Aleema lured a Jedi fleet into the nearby Cron Cluster, just as Exar Kun had predicted. Aleema ripped the core out of one of the stars, incinerating the Jedi fleet, however she was unable to control the explosion. A chain reaction began, with all ten stars going nova and destroying the Corsair along with Aleema and Crado. Also according to Exar Kuns plan, the supernova headed directly at Ossus, the primary target of the Sith.\nWhile the Jedi attempted to evacuate Ossus with as many relics and artifacts as they could, Exar Kun and Ulic lead an attack against the planet. Kun's Massassi warriors looted what remained of the Jedi library while the Dark Lord himself attempted to steal a cache of ancient lightsabers from the Neti Jedi Master Ood Bnar. Kun failed as Bnar transformed into a giant tree and hid the lightsabers beneath his body, not to be disturbed again until millennia later. Ulic flew above the fray during the battle, only to be confronted by his brother, Cay Qel-Droma, who had sensed his presence. Ulic and Cay landed and began a duel which ended with Ulic killing the brother he had once fought alongside as a Jedi. Witnessing the murder, Nomi Sunrider trapped Ulic in a \"wall of light\" and cut him off from the Force out of disgust for what he had become. Ulic only now realized what he had done and renounced his Sith ties, agreeing to help the Jedi defeat the Dark Lord Exar Kun. After both the Jedi and Sith retreated from the planet, Ossus was hit by the Cron Supernova, destroying all life on the planet, save for Master Bnar.\nOn other battlefields across the galaxy, the war still raged. Following the Jedi victory at the Battle of Toprawa, the failed Jedi apprentice Haazen was nearly killed by explosions in caverns that claimed the life of many of his fellow Jedi, including Barrison Draay. Haazen was revived by the Sith and turned to the dark side, only to hide his allegiances following the end of the war. On Onderon, the remaining Mandalorian warriors were beaten back and retreated to Dxun, where Mandalore the Indomitable was killed by wild animals. With Ulics help, the Jedi also prepared for a massive assault on Kuns fortress on Yavin 4. The war was drawing to a close, and Exar Kun was the last leader of the Sith still standing.\nAbove Yavin, thousands of Jedi ships descended towards Kuns fortress. Realizing the war was lost, Kun assembled his Massassi warriors at the temples left behind by Naga Sadow. Exar Kun called upon Sith magic and drained his Massassi slaves of their life force, killing them. The energy he gained from them allowed the Dark Lord to break free of his mortal body and maintain his spirit, which hoped to leave Yavin to continue the war elsewhere in the galaxy. Sensing this, Nomi and rest of the assembled Jedi created a wall of light around Yavin 4, hoping it would have the same effect as it did against Ulic on Ossus. The massive surge of light side energy managed to keep Exar Kuns spirit trapped on the planet, tied to one of his temples, however the collision of light energy from the Jedi and dark from Kun's Sith magic caused a massive firestorm to erupt and rage across the moon, killing all life on its surface. The Jedi retreated, their mission accomplished. The Great Sith War was over, and the Sith Order was defeated.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Great Sith War, the remains of the Brotherhood of the Sith were disbanded. The Empress Teta system was finally liberated from the remnants of the Krath at the recapture of the Empress Teta system and the Jedi and Republic began the long process of rebuilding a broken galaxy. During this period, the Jedi initiated the Great Hunt, which was an effort to kill Exar Kuns remaining Tarentateks that terrorized the Order during the war. The program was mostly successful, however several beasts survived on both Korriban and Kashyyyk. The Jedi also attempted to destroy the Sith-inspired Mecrosa Order, however their attempts were unsuccessful. The few surviving members of the Brotherhood were still scattered throughout the galaxy. Toki Tollivar became a serial killer on Corellia, Haazen infiltrated the Jedi Covenant, an organization designed to ensure the extinction of the Sith, and Ulic Qel-Droma was killed shortly after his redemption on Rhen Var. The Old Sith Empire continued to survive in obscurity in the unknown regions, still lead by the same Sith Lord who had escaped the Empires destruction centuries before during the Great Hyperspace War.\n\n\u2022 Surviving influences\n\nCanderous Ordo\n, Sith Acolyte in hiding]]\nThe remnants of the ancient Sith Empire saw an opportunity for revenge in the form of the Mandalorians. After Mandalore the Indomitables death on Dxun during the war, Mandalore the Ultimate rose to take his place as leader of the Mandalorian clans. This new Mandalore reformed his warriors into the Neo-Crusaders and made a base on the moon of Dxun. According to Canderous Ordo, Mandalore was approached by the Sith and goaded into attacking the Republic, as it was weak and still rebuilding in the aftermath of the Great Sith War. Mandalore accepted and readied his armies for war, and in 3976 BBY, twenty years after the conclusion of the Great Sith War, the Mandalorians began a brutal campaign for dominance over the Outer Rim and areas of Unknown Regions. The Neo-Crusaders were able to carve out an area of space for themselves that exceeded that of the Hutt Empire, however the Republic refused to respond to the threat until the Mandalorians neared the business world of Taris, at which point the Galactic Senate pledged its support to the defense of Taris- a defense lead by Admiral Saul Karath. A military-security cordon was established and the battle entered into an uneasy period of tension. While the Republic leapt headlong into the conflict, the Jedi remained cautious. The High Council decided it would not aid the Republic, turning the sentiment of much of the Republic Army against them.\nand his talisman]]\nDuring this period, the Jedi Covenants First WatchCircle, a group of Jedi Consulars based on Taris, received a Force vision depicting the return of the Sith. The Jedi Covenants purpose was to prevent this specific event from happening, thereby avoiding yet another Great Sith War. In response, these Jedi Consulars massacred their students, who they believed to be the source of the future Sith menace. Zayne Carrick, Padawan to Lucien Draay, was the only one of the five students to survive. The First WatchCircle and the Jedi Covenant framed Carrick for the massacre, claiming he had turned to the dark side. In reality, all of these events were being engineered by Haazen, the Sith acolyte still in hiding within the Jedi Covenant since the conclusion of the war. Haazen had been Draays Jedi Master, and since his grievous injuries and turn to the dark side during the war, he had been plotting to destroy the Jedi Order from within by wresting control of the Covenant away from Luciens mother, Krynda Draay.\nAs the Jedi hunted for Carrick, he and Covenant Shadow Celeste Morne encountered the Muur Talisman on Taris. The ancient relic of the original Sith Empire had somehow made its way to the city-planet, where the Rakghoul Plague that had been created by Karness Muur several millennia before ran rampant. Shortly after the two Jedi discovered it, the Talisman was taken to Jebble by invading Mandalorian forces. There, it transformed an entire Mandalorian army into Rakghouls that threatened to leave the planet and spread the disease throughout the galaxy. Morne and Carrick also discovered that the Talisman still contained the spirit of Karness Muur himself, who hoped to possess a Force-sensitive body and create a new Sith era enforced by his Rakghouls. Celeste Morne, who had dedicated her life to the prevention of the return of the Sith, allowed the Talisman to attach itself to her. She was able to control Muur to some degree, however she was corrupted as well, and was in danger of slipping to the dark side. Carrick and Morne discovered another Sith artifact on Jebble that had been acquired by the Mandalorians&mdash;Dreypa's Oubliette. The oubliette was designed to contain both Muur and the plague, but Morne would have to be interred within it as well. Carrick planned to leave and return with help for her, but, shortly after his departure, the Mandalorian fleet arrived and bombarded the planet with nuclear warheads, killing the Rakghouls and flooding the once-frozen world. Carrick believed Morne to be dead; however, she was safely in stasis within the intact oubliette, and would remain there for almost four millennia.\nZayne Carrick traveled to Coruscant shortly after, hoping to force a member of the First WatchCircle to confess to their crime and clear Zaynes name. Master Xamar gave in and confessed to the Jedi Council, which then ordered an assault on the Draay Estate, headquarters of the Covenant. Having already poisoned Krynda, Haazen set his plan into motion, initiating \"Vindication,\" a contingency plan that was to be put into effect should the Jedi Council come under the influence of the Sith. \"Vindication\" placed the orbiting Republic fleet in Haazens control, allowing him to kill many of the attacking Jedi with orbital bombardment. Carrick and Lucien Draay were the only two Jedi not forced to retreat, and although Haazen nearly pulled Draay to the dark side, the Jedi refused to join the Sith and instead killed Haazen by redirecting the Republic ships to fire directly at the Draay Estate. Both Carrick and Draay survived; however, neither returned to the Jedi Order, deciding to take different paths. Carrick and his friends later killed Toki Tollivar, another Sith Acolyte who had been in hiding since the conclusion of the war.\n\n\u2022 The making of Revan\n\nKnights of the Old Republic 0]]\n, Alek, and several Revanchists on Cathar]]\nAs tension in the Outer Rim escalated, several members of the Jedi Order began to voice their opposition to the Councils decision to remain uninvolved. Foremost among these dissidents was the Jedi Knight Revan. He, along with his close friend Alek, began to advocate for the Jedi to enter the war alongside the Republic. Although many Jedi remained loyal to the Councils decision, many younger Jedi joined Revan and Alek and began to scout the front lines. Revan's followers soon adopted the name \"Revanchists\". As these renegades probed the borders between Mandalorian and Republic space, Taris descended into chaos following the \"Padawan Massacre\" and the departure of the Jedi Masters stationed there. Seeing his opportunity to seize the planet, Mandalore the Ultimate initiated the true Mandalorian War, unleashing his armada into Republic space and overwhelming the under-prepared security forces. The Republic suffered grievous losses in battles at Onderon, Vanquo, several Outer Rim Colonies, Taris, and Serroco.\non Malachor V]]\nSeeing the carnage, Revan released records of the Genocide of Cathar, a Mandalorian operation that had occurred in the early stages of the war after the Councils refusal to take part in the conflict, to garner support for his cause. The reports shocked both the Republic and the Jedi, leading to more greater for both Revan and Alek, who had adopted the alias Malak since the events surrounding \"Vindication\". The two led the Revanchists (also known as the Jedi Crusaders) to join the Republic military and fight in battles across the galaxy. Revan and Malak, alongside Meetra Surik, proved to be capable military commanders and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually gaining control over a full third of the Republic Navy. The soldiers under their command became incredibly loyal to the Jedi and increasingly averse to the Council and Knights who chose to remain out of the war. As Revan and Malak continued their crusade, the tide began to turn in their favor. The Mandalorian armies were beaten back on Taris and crushed at Dxun. Revan and Malaks tactics became increasingly brutal as the war raged on. They sacrificed countless Republic soldiers on Dxun simply to drive the Mandalorians off the moon and decimated Mandalorian ground forces on Althir. Soon the Mandalorians had retreated to their pre-war Empire in the unknown regions, pursued by Revan's forces. Revan was a hero to the Republic and the Jedi and appeared to have been vindicated in his defiance of the Council.\nHowever, appearances were deceiving. Early in the war, during Revans original scouting of the area surrounding Mandalorian Space, he came upon Malachor V, a world considered forbidden by Mandalorians. By this time the hidden Empire had forgotten the world. The Jedi traveled to the planets surface and was immediately overwhelmed by dark side energies. Malachor had once belonged to the ancient Sith Empire, and was saturated with the dark side. In an effort to save himself from being consumed by the dark side, Revan fed off of it instead. He had also stumbled upon the Trayus Academy, an ancient repository of Sith teachings built around a dark side geyser. It was there that he learned the location of Korriban and the existence of a hidden Sith Empire, the faction of the original Empire that had survived the Great Hyperspace War and been in hiding beyond the Unknown Regions for thousands of years. Revan, believing these Sith to be a greater evil than the Mandalorians, accepted the Sith way and the power it offered, hoping that he could defend the galaxy from this newly discovered threat. He also believed that these Sith had somehow influenced the Mandalorians into attacking the Republic. Revan introduced Malak to the teachings of the Sith, and together the two adopted the title of Sith Lords, with Revan as the Dark Lord and Malak as the Apprentice. They remade themselves into Darth Revan and Darth Malak, marking the first recorded use of the honorific Darth title. During the war, Revan also discovered a Star Map on Kashyyyk- an ancient relic of the Infinite Empire which had attempted to conquer the original Sith people far before the creation of the Sith religious order. The Star Map hinted at the existence of an ancient superweapon that Revan would focus on finding after the war. The new Sith made preparations for the final battle of the Mandalorian Wars and their forces in the aftermath of the conflict. Sith teachings began to spread through the Republic fleet, going largely unquestioned, as Revan and Malak were still the heroes of the Republic.\n]]\nThe new Dark Lord decided that Malachor V would be the final battleground, positioning a fleet of Republic ships in orbit consisting of crewmen and soldiers who were not fanatically loyal to him. The Mandalorians temptation for battle eclipsed their desire to avoid Malachor, and so began a final, massive assault on the Republic fleet which was being lead by Surik. Prior to the battle, Revan had entrusted her with the Mass Shadow Generator, a new superweapon designed by the Zabrak engineer Bao-Dur. As the battle began, the Republic forces were overwhelmed and suffered crippling losses, but Revan soon arrived with reinforcements and the power of Sith teachings. He drew upon the dark energy of the planet below, invigorating his forces and drawing many of them to the dark side. Revan himself killed Mandalore the Ultimate, and the remaining Mandalorian forces were pushed towards Malachor. At this point the Jedi Crusader leading the fleet ordered the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator and watched in horror as thousands of ships from both the Mandalorian and Republic fleets were crushed in an artificial gravity well. The wreckage slammed into the planet and ruptured its crust, leaving nothing but a broken core. The countless deaths could be felt through the Force, causing the Jedi Crusader to cut herself off from the Force to avoid death. The battle ended with almost all of the Mandalorians killed, and the remaining declaring their unconditional surrender to Revan, who disbanded the warriors and sentenced them to perpetual exile. The surviving Jedi were either turned to the dark side or killed by Revan and Malak; however, the Dark Lord allowed the now-Force-dead Surik to escape and return to the Jedi Council on Coruscant, where she would be sentenced to exile for her actions during the war. Revan had single-handedly defeated the Mandalorian menace and could have returned to Coruscant as a hero, despite the tragedy over Malachor V.\nHowever, to everybody's surprise, he and Malak, along with a full third of the Republic fleet, disappeared into the Unknown Regions shortly after the Battle of Malachor. The official reason was that they were hunting down the last of the Mandalorians, but the Sith Lords and their fleet were actually searching the galaxy for the Star Forge, the ancient weapon which Revan had learned about from the Star Map. Several years passed with the Republic receiving no word from the missing fleet, and it was assumed that the heroes of the Mandalorian Wars were dead.\n\n\u2022 The Jedi Civil War and the redemption of Darth Revan\n\nJedi Master]] Dorak\nin the Unknown Regions.]]\nHowever, Revan and Malak were very much alive. During their time in the Unknown Regions, they encountered a Sith Empire established by the Sith Emperor. The Dark Lord converted them to his cause and recruited them. These two Sith Lords were dispatched back into Republic space to locate the Star Forge to allow the Empire to drastically boost its military production. Unfortunately for the Emperor, Darths Revan and Malak became overly ambitious without his direct supervision and claimed the Star Forge for themselves. Revan began a campaign to end the \"tyranny\" of the Jedi Council once and for all. Together with Malak, Revan went to Korriban and seized control of the planet, secretly establishing a new Sith academy not far from the settlement Dreshdae.\nAbout a year after Revans return to known space, the first battle of the new conflict, the Jedi Civil War, began. In a surprise attack, Revans fleet swept into the unprepared Foerost system, quickly overcoming their defenses. It was after this battle that Revan and Malak officially announced to the galaxy that they now were now Sith Lords, Darth Revan and Darth Malak, and captured the majority of the Republic Fleet based in the drydocks around Foerost, dealing a crippling blow to the Republic. The second planet to be attacked by the Sith was Telos IV, a strategically-important planet on the edge of Republic-controlled space whose military and economic power bases were considered vital to the Republic. Although Darth Revan had intended for Telos to be conquered, Darth Malak ordered the former Republic admiral Saul Karath to prove his loyalty to the Sith by destroying Telos - Karath complied.\n, Darth Revan's Sith apprentice and successor.]]\nWhile a destructive war, Revan sought to do as little damage to the Republics infrastructure as possible. Under his leadership, Sith forces bypassed militarily vital planets that would be required for the defense of the galaxy against the threat of the hidden Sith Empire. Revan never intended to destroy the Republic, but to unite it under his banner, so it was vital for him to keep the Republic largely intact for the purposes of post-war rebuilding. Revan, seeing the need for corporate assistance in providing necessary material for the war effort, entered a partnership with the Czerka Corporation, a galaxy-spanning conglomerate with such diverse interests as mining, slaving, and manufacturing items such as arms, armor, and droids. Offered a trade monopoly within Sith space, the corporation helped to sponsor the establishment and growth of the Dreshdae colony on Korriban as part of their supply network. The corporation continued to provide logistical support for the Sith Empire throughout the course of the war. They also secured diplomatic relations with the ocean planet of Manaan so that they would able to export the healing substance known as kolto. Revan even took out a number of political figureheads who stood in his way. Amongst them was: Yusanis of the Echani, Senator Mimas Yoon of Corellia, and Lelin-Dor of Serroco. By doing so Revan would be able to begin his rule with a functioning army and a stable economy without his rule being questioned. He believed that even if he were to fail in his conquest of the Republic, the result would be the same; a stronger Republic more capable of defending itself against the hidden Sith Empire.\nUnlike most, Revan understood that his war was never truly against the Republic, but against the Jedi. Revan believed that whoever had the most and the strongest Jedi would win the war. He would either convert or kill captured Jedi, relying on secrecy instead of brute force. His Sith assassins quietly flooded into the Republic to achieve this goal Jedi throughout known space. Revan reestablished old strongholds and academies upon worlds of ancient power such as Lehon, Dxun, and Korriban. There his most faithful servants broke captured Jedi and converted them to the dark side. If any Force-sensitive was found within his ranks he captured them as well and made them into Dark Jedi.\nconfronts Darth Revan during his capture.]]\nDarth Revans tactical brilliance caught the Republic completely off-guard and the Sith won battle after battle until a young Jedi Knight named Bastila Shan entered the fray. Bastila could use battle meditation, a powerful Force-power that increased the combat effectiveness of the Republics forces and sapped the will of enemy combatants. The Republic knew, however, that even with Bastilas powerful battle meditation, they wouldnt be able to stand against the Sith for long, so the Jedi Council drafted a plan to capture Darth Revan, thus depriving the Sith of their greatest leader and tactician. While Darth Revans fleet was distracted by a small force of Republic warships, a Jedi strike-team consisting of Bastila Shan and a number of Jedi Knights boarded Revans flagship, overcoming his guards and cornering the Dark Lord on the bridge. Darth Malak, determined to become the Sith Master, ordered the ships under his command to fire upon the bridge of his mentor's flagship, intending to kill both the Jedi boarding party and his master in order to claim the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith for himself.\nUnknown to the newly crowned Dark Lord Darth Malak, his old mentor was still very much alive. As the only other survivor of the attack, Bastila Shan used the Force to preserve the flicker of life that remained within the unconscious Dark Lord. This act created a Force bond between the two, an event that would have lasting repercussions in the future. Shan then brought Darth Revan to the Jedi Council on Dantooine, where they used the Force to temporarily wipe his memory. Revan was then reprogrammed with a new identity, one loyal to the Republic, while Bastila Shan was charged with keeping Darth Revans identity hidden and drawing out the former Dark Lords memories.\n\n\u2022 Reign of Darth Malak and Revan's reemergence\n\nBastila Shan\nAlthough Darth Malak lacked the tactical superiority of his former master, relying instead on brute force, the sheer size of his armadas allowed him to win many victories over the battered and outnumbered Republic forces. Unlike Darth Revan, Darth Malak would destroy worlds rather than capture them, taking away vital resources from both sides. Throughout the conflict Darth Malak became much more reliant upon the Star Forge than Revan had been. He took a former Jedi whose quest for power had set him apart from his fellow students and named him Darth Bandon, making him his Shadow Hand and the second-in-command in the Sith Empire. As his forces tore through Republic space, Darth Malak felt that the only thing that could stop him from taking over the galaxy was Shans powerful battle meditation. Therefore, he expended tremendous resources to locate and capture Shan, hoping to turn her to his cause or kill her if this proved impossible.\nleads his Sith troopers and Dark Jedi into battle.]]\nAs the war raged on, Revan, under an implanted name and with no recollection of his real history or of his former mastery of the Force, was enlisted as a common soldier in the Republic army and placed on the Republic warship Endar Spire. Darth Malak's hunt for Shan led him to this ship, where he sent Darth Bandon, along with a Sith armada, to ambush the ship. There, while boarding the vessel, Darth Bandon encountered Revan, but before he had the chance to kill the amnesiac Dark Lord, a Republic ensign sacrificed himself so that Revan could escape the ship. Shan successfully fled the ship aboard one of the escape pods and crash-landed on Taris, as did Revan and the Republic commander Carth Onasi. Malak ordered a blockade of the planet so that the Sith could search for Shan.\n, Darth Malak's Sith apprentice]]\nAfter crash-landing on the surface of Taris, Revan began experiencing flashbacks through the Force of his buried past. On Taris, Revan and Onasi had to rescue Bastila Shan from the Black Vulkars swoop gang with the assistance of the young Twilek Mission Vao, her Wookiee partner Zaalbar, and the Mandalorian war veteran Canderous Ordo. With the help of his new droid companion, T3-M4, Revan was able to steal the bypass codes to the Sith blockade from the Sith base and could escape the planet. However, once Revan and his newly formed team (which included Bastila) left the surface, Darth Malak ordered an orbital bombardment of the planet, hoping to eliminate Bastila together with the billions of Tarisians living on its surface.\nRevan found on Dantooine]]\nDeciding to regroup, Revan and his companions fled to the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. There, Revan was trained again in the ways of the Force by a reluctant Jedi Council. During his training he performed various important tasks in the area around the Enclave. Among these tasks was to cleanse a meditation grove of a dark taint. The taint soon turned out to be a Cathar Dark Jedi named Juhani, who he redeemed and convinced to return to return to the Jedi. Soon afterwards, Shan and Revan shared a dream of Revan and Malak exploring the nearby ruins and discovering a Star Map, a Rakatan artifact that, when combined with the other four Star Maps, Revan had used to find the location of the Star Forge. Upon learning this, the Jedi Council placed it upon Revan and Shan to travel to the worlds where the other Star Maps were hidden and find the location of the Star Forge. Although the Council still wanted Bastila to continue to draw out Revans memories, they were also curious to see if Revan could accomplish this mission without falling to the dark side. Juhani also requested that she be allowed to join Revans party.\nRevan, Shan, and their companions journeyed to these worlds, retracing the steps of Darth Revan and Malak from years before. During these travels they gained two new companions; on Tatooine, Revan purchased HK-47, the assassin droid that he had created as a Sith Lord, and on Kashyyyk, the self-exiled Jedi named Jolee Bindo joined his party. Additionally, the crew of the Ebon Hawk found themselves hunted by both the Sith and bounty hunters and confronted with the problems of the local populace at every turn. One of their greatest challenges was when Darth Bandon finally caught up with the party, only to meet his end at the hands of Revan. Throughout their journey, Revan and Bastila grew closer due to the feelings created by their Force bond. Bastila feared their love, thinking it would lead to the dark side. In truth, she was afraid to face her feelings, out of fear of who Revan once was. She attempted to resist the feelings, but their love was too great to avoid.\nAs the crew searched for the final Star Map, Revan and his allies were captured by the Sith flagship Leviathan under the command of Admiral Saul Karath. As the Ebon Hawk was being brought in via tractor beam, its crew decided that it would be best for another member of the party to use their talents to either avoid or escape confinement and then liberate the rest of the crew. Aboard the ship, Admiral Karath interrogated Revan, Shan and Onasi personally, informing them of the destruction of the Dantooine Enclave as he attempted to extract information from them; however, despite their torture, Karath was unable to learn anything. After the Admiral's eventual departure, both Bastila and Revan determined that Karath had sent a message to Darth Malak with their location and that he was making his way towards them. Meanwhile, the Ebon Hawk crewmember succeeded in getting away from their guards and managed to unlock the holding cells and force cages that held the rest of the group captive.\n]]\nReunited, the crew worked together to escape the Leviathan. On the way, the crew confronted Admiral Karath on the bridge deck, and a furious battle took place, resulting in the Admirals death. With his dying breaths, the onetime Republic officer told Onasi of Revans true nature. Making a break for it, the crew fled towards the Ebon Hawk, but, despite their haste, the trio was intercepted by the Dark Lord. As surprised as he was amused at the events that had transpired since his betrayal, Darth Malak gleefully filled Revan in on the details of who he was&mdash;and what he had been made into. Revan, shocked by the revelation, asked Bastila if Malak spoke the truth. She affirmed said truth and went on to explain everything. Following their brief discussion, Darth Malak created a stasis field around Shan and Onasi and prepared to end his former Master. Revan proved himself a capable swordsman, holding his own against the Dark Lord. However, Shan intervened so that Revan and Onasi could escape. Darth Malak defeated and captured her. Reluctantly, Revan and Onasi left, and escaped the Leviathan with the rest of their crew. Revan was thus forced to deal with Darth Malak's revelation and the loss of his beloved Bastila.\noutside the Temple of the Ancients.]]\nDarth Malak then attempted to turn Bastila to the dark side and become his new Sith apprentice, torturing her with Force lightning. She was firm at first, but after a week of endless torture, he succeeded in breaking her and turned her to the dark side. Shan became his apprentice, replacing the slain Darth Bandon. His primary motive in this was to gain the power of her battle meditation. Meanwhile, the preparations for the Star Forge were nearing completion and the Sith forces had grown greater than ever before, and Revan found the fifth and final Star Map, rediscovering the location of the Star Forge.\nUpon arriving, the Ebon Hawk was crashed on the unknown planet because of its disruptor field. With their hyperdrive damaged, Onasi was forced to make an emergency landing on one of the planets smaller islands&mdash;the very same island that held the Temple of the Ancients. After several run-ins with the native Rakata, Revan was able to piece together what had transpired during his and Malaks last visit to the forgotten world. With the help of the Rakata, he, accompanied by Jolee Bindo and Juhani, entered the Temple of the Ancients in order to shut down the disruptor field so that the incoming Republic fleet would not suffer a similar fate. At the top the Temple they were confronted by Bastila; now a Sith apprentice to Darth Malak. Mocking the three and taunting the anguished Revan, she engaged them in a brief lightsaber duel. Shan was no match for Revans power and threw a Force wave at the three in order to save herself from defeat. After seeing how powerful Revan was, she came to believe that Revan deserved to be the Dark Lord of the Sith. She attempted to entice Revan to reclaim his former title and take her as his apprentice. Revan rejected Bastilas temptation, choosing the path of the Jedi, and tried to turn Bastila back to the light, reminding her of the of love between them. Angered at her failure to turn Revan, Shan retreated to the Star Forge, where she and Revan would face each other again during the final battle.\n\n\u2022 The Fall of Darth Malak and Revan's departure to the Unknown Regions\n\nDarth Malak to Revan\n.]]\nRevan and his crew repaired the Ebon Hawk and pursued Shan as a Republic fleet and a group of surviving Jedi from the Jedi Enclave arrived, commencing an assault on the Star Forge. Revan, with his two companions and a Jedi strike team, boarded the Star Forge in hopes of disrupting Shans battle meditation long enough to give the Republic fleet a chance. Aboard the Star Forge, Revan displayed his restored affinity for the Force and mastery of lightsaber combat by confronting and defeating Malaks army of Star Forge battle droids and Dark Jedi with little help from others. In the Star Forge's war room, Revan faced off against Shan once again, this time alone. Although Shan was able to draw on the Star Forge to renew her strength, Revan still bested her. She begged Revan to kill her after all she had done, but Revan attempted to convince her to return to the light side by drawing on the powerful bond of love they shared. He succeeded, and Shan used her battle meditation to aid the Republic, turning the tide of the battle.\nAs Shan used her powers to shift the balance of power, Revan went on to confront Darth Malak atop the highest levels of the station. There Revan faced Darth Malak in a brutal lightsaber duel during which the Dark Lord attempted to siphon off the remaining Force-energy of several dead Jedi; Revan, however, was able to use his own power to prevent this. After defeating his former apprentice, he and Shan, along with Onasi and the others, boarded the Ebon Hawk and escaped the stations destruction. With the Star Forge destroyed, the will of the remaining Sith forces in orbit was broken and they were defeated; as a result of this action, the destructive war that had claimed so many lives&mdash;on both sides&mdash;finally came to an end. Revan and his crew were given a heros escort back to Lehon. There, they were each rewarded with the Cross of Glory, the Republic's highest award. Jedi Master Vandar Tokare also thanked Revan, re-bestowing his rank of Jedi Knight and proclaiming him the \"Prodigal Knight\", and his friends as the heroes of the era and galaxy.\nAfter the wars end, however, Revan began to recover more and more of his lost memories despite what the Jedi had done to wipe them away. As time went on, the former Dark Lord remembered the threat posed by the hidden Sith Empire that he had encountered in the Unknown Regions. Leaving behind Shan, those who had served alongside him at wars end, and all of his possessions, Revan departed known space in order to face this threat in his own way. The exiled Jedi Master Kreia, who had taught Revan when he was still a Padawan, had gone in search of both him and what had driven him to leave the Republic behind and wage a war against it; eventually she too found Malachor V and, corrupted by its dark energies, began to form the Sith Triumvirate.\n\n\u2022 The Sith Triumvirate and the First Jedi Purge\n\nKreia\n.]]\nWith the death of Darth Malak and Revans disappearance, the Sith were left with a massive power vacuum that resulted in their own civil war. The lesser Sith Lords of the Empire, left without a strong leader, turned upon each other, attempting to take what scraps they could from the ruins of the Empire. Declaring themselves sovereign warlords, they fractured the empire into a number of small, hotly-contested kingdoms. At the height of the civil war on Korriban, Revan led a host of Jedi in an invasion of the Sith homeworld, and his forces successfully drove the Sith Lords from the planet. When Republic forces arrived on Korriban approximately a year after the Jedi Civil Wars conclusion, they found the planet to be barren and lifeless. With the fall of the Sith Empire, the Galactic Republic was able to conquer Sith space, and reclaim worlds that had been under Sith control since the Great Sith War.\nAfter the fall of Korriban, only one Sith faction remained active in Republic space, a secretive and elusive Sith faction known as the Sith Triumvirate, led by the three Sith Lords Darth Traya and her apprentices Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus. Darth Traya was the Sith alias of the former Jedi Master Kreia, the first and last master of Revan, who was exiled by the Jedi Council for her part in Revan's training, and of others who the Council deemed as failures.\nAfter her exile from the Order, Kreia started questioning her beliefs and philosophy. She began searching for answers, meeting those she had affected through her teachings. Eventually, she came to Malachor V, a dead world, powerful in the dark side. She was curious, and the Sith ruins drew her in. She became overpowered with the allure of the dark side, and became Darth Traya, the \"Lord of Betrayal,\" having been betrayed by the Jedi and ready to betray in turn. She attained the title of headmistress of the Trayus Academy, able to hold any students willing to fight for the cause of the Sith: to destroy the Jedi.\nTwo more Sith Lords came to join forces with Darth Traya on Malachor. The first was Darth Nihilus, the \"Lord of Hunger,\" who before becoming a Sith, lost everything to the Mandalorians during the war. A survivor of the Mass Shadow Generator in the wars final battle at Malachor V, the experience of the shadows made him \"hunger\" for Force energy and the affliction began to ravage his body. In his pain he became a wound in the Force and was found by Darth Traya. She told him that she could teach him to feed his hunger. He accepted her offer, becoming Trayas apprentice. The next to come was Darth Sion, the \"Lord of Pain,\" a long-time Sith, having served Exar Kun's Sith Empire until the day he was struck down.\nRather than die, Sion found that by calling on his pain, anger, and hatred, he could rise from certain death and achieve immortality at the cost of all-consuming agony. With a body fractured and decomposing but held together by the dark side of the Force, Sion survived the Great Sith War. When the civil war broke out Sion fled Korriban, he came to Malachor V, where he found the Trayus Academy and Darth Traya. His brutality and strength were noted by Traya during his tutelage under her, but the two soon disliked each other because rather than yearn for knowledge or studies as she did, he sought hatred and power.\nAt the completion of their training, these three became co-rulers of an Empire. The remnants of Revan and Malaks forces soon joined them on Malachor V where they subtly intervened with galactic affairs, using Trayas idea of echoes in the Force and corrupting Jedi to the dark side. Sion quickly grew impatient of waiting to fight the Jedi and the Republic while Nihilus grew hungry and in need of Force sustenance. The two conspired against Traya for a time, and when she was vulnerable, they struck. She was cornered from two sides in the Trayus Core while meditating and violently subdued. During this time, the two Lords used an unknown Force technique to sever her connection to the Force, though this allowed their master to turn the dark side of the Force. Traya, Lord of Betrayal, was betrayed again.\nCast out by both Jedi and Sith, Kreia directed her attention towards Meetra Surik, a Jedi who followed Revan into the Mandalorian Wars and was exiled from the Jedi Order for severing her ties to the Force. Kreia took Surik as her student as Sion and Nihilus, now with dual control of the remnants of the Empire, split the Empire into equal portions and went their separate ways as though they shared the belief in Jedi extermination, their conflicting philosophies, their being as Sith, ruled out working together.\nThey took their respective factions into hiding and initiated a covert shadow war against the Jedi, starting the First Jedi Purge. Sion led an army of Sith assassins from the Trayus academy in a bloody crusade, while Nihilus worked from his ship controlling his half-dead thralls and using his powers to feed on the life-force of entire worlds, gravitating towards planets with a Jedi presence.\nThough working independently, the two reduced the number of surviving Jedi down to less than one hundred by 3951 BBY.\n\n\u2022 The Jedi Exile\n\n\u2022 Survival and search\n\nKreia\nWhile the new Dark Lords thought Darth Traya dead, this was not the case. Left extremely weakened, she managed to escape and went into self imposed exile. Claiming the Ebon Hawk, Revan's old ship, for herself, she proceed to wander the galaxy, searching for a specific Jedi veteran of the Mandalorian wars.\nThe veteran in question was Meetra Surik, a high ranking Republic general who had led numerous battles and was involved in the final battle at Malachor V. It was she who ordered the Zabrak engineer Bao-Dur to activate the Mass Shadow Generator at Malachor, decimating the Mandalorian fleet. With the end of the war, she was the only Jedi to answer the Jedi Council's summons and return to Coruscant. Within the High Council Chamber within the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, she stood before the Jedi for judgment. Due to her experiences at Malachor V, she had involuntarily disconnected herself from the Force, becoming a wound in the Force, an empty void. Sensing the emptiness within her, and unsure how to deal with it or its ramifications, the council exiled her.\nSurik took to wandering the galaxy, gradually revisiting most of the old battlegrounds where she had fought. As she traveled to Telos aboard the Republic cruiser Harbinger, she was drugged and stowed away by an HK-50 assassin droid looking to collect on the Jedi bounty posted by the Exchange crime syndicate. However, as this took place, the Harbinger encountered the Ebon Hawk, which was being pursued by a Sith warship commanded by Darth Sion. The Hawk was allowed to land on the Harbinger while it docked with the Sith warship and searched it. Kreia, Darth Traya no longer, found Surik and took her aboard the Ebon Hawk, unknowingly followed by the HK-50. At the same time, the Harbinger search teams found the Sith warship empty with the exception of a heavily mutilated body that somehow remained just barely alive despite the extreme damage it showed.\nThe \"body\" was revealed to be Darth Sion himself. Sion relied on his rage-fuelled power in the Force to literally pull his body back together, achieving a form of immortality and used this ability to masquerade as a dead body. However, as he could only keep his body together, not repair the damage it sustained, he was left in constant agony and had the appearance of that which he pretended to be; a corpse.\n\n\u2022 Harbinger\n\nBursting out of the Kolto tank that his body had been placed in, he commandeered the ship with the aid of the Sith Assassin crew of his warship that had secretly infiltrated the Harbinger when it had docked with his own ship via umbilical. As he took over, Kreia took off in the Ebon Hawk with the drugged Surik in tow. However, the now Sith-controlled Harbinger fired on the Hawk as it jumped into hyperspace, forcing the ship to make a droid controlled landing at the Peragus Mining Facility.\nAt the facility, the blacked out Surik and near-dead Kreia were placed in the medical bay while the HK-50 stowaway assumed the role of the facilities maintenance assistant. The assassin droid used his new position to reprogram the facilities droid miners to attack the organic ones, fool the computers into believing that there was an explosion, confining the remaining miners to the reinforced dormitories, sabotage the ventilation system to kill the trapped miners, and cause all the med-bay patients, including the Exile, to receive a near-lethal dose of sedative.\nWhile the other patients were killed by this, Suriks Jedi training enabled her to withstand the effects and survive, as HK-50 anticipated. However, she withstood the effects far better than the droid intended and awoke. Wandering the medbay, Surik encountered the now recovered Kreia and began searching the facility for an escape route, meeting the confined Atton Rand. With Rands help, they managed to find a way to the hanger, where the Ebon Hawk was kept. Fortunately, the ship had been repaired under orders from the HK-50 to serve as an escape vehicle. However, before they could escape, the Harbinger, under Sions command, arrived at the facility and docked. As they needed the current asteroid drift charts to navigate the field surrounding Peragus, they were forced to board the Harbinger' to obtain them, battling and destroying the HK-50 along the way.\nUnfortunately, before they could make good their escape, they encountered Darth Sion.\nWhile Atton Rand and Surik fled to the Ebon Hawk, Kreia remained behind to hold off Sion. After a short conversation between the two, during which Kreia hid from her former apprentice with the Force, Sion took advantage of a momentary lapse in her illusion to amputate her hand with a lightning fast strike. This caused a Force link between Kreia and Surik to reveal itself, as Surik felt Kreia's pain. Despite this, they managed to escape to Telos.\nUnfortunately, the Peragus Mining Facility was destroyed by Sion as he pursued them, an event that would have drastic ramifications for the Republic.\n\n\u2022 Telos\n\nTheir visit to Telos was a total debacle. Firstly, as they had come from Peragus, they were arrested in connection with the destruction of the facility. While in custody, the Ebon Hawk was stolen and they were attacked by a bounty hunter that had infiltrated the Telos Security Force, then they were confined to house arrest, and while they were eventually let go, they were still confined to the Telos Citadel Station in orbit above the ravaged world. Though they managed to procure a shuttle to journey down to one of the restoration zones on Telos's surface, they were shot down by a Czerka Corporation survey team.\nFortunately, they encountered Bao-Dur, who had taken a job as shield technician on Telos. He pulled them out of the burning wreck and helped them escape the restoration zone, commandeering a shuttle in the ruins of the Telos military base. In the shuttle, they flew to a secret academy established by Jedi Master Atris at the north pole of Telos. There the Exile met with Atris and negotiated the return of the Ebon Hawk, which had been stolen by her agents.\nWhile Surik met with Atris, Kreia forcefully probed Atton Rand's mind, discovering that he had been one of the Sith Troopers during the Jedi Civil War, specializing in Jedi hunting&hellip; and torturing. Atton, who was deeply ashamed of his actions, was blackmailed by Kreia to be an instrument of her manipulations.\n\n\u2022 Mission\n\nOnce under way again, the Exile resolved to gather the remaining Jedi, supposedly to fight back against the Sith, but truly to get an explanation of what happened to her and why she was exiled.\nThey proceeded to journey to the various worlds the Jedi masters were last known to have been. On Dantooine, they found Master Vrook Lamar and aided him at defeating an Exchange-controlled mercenary army bent on destroying the worlds fragile government. On Nar Shaddaa, they became involved in the vicious intrigue between the Exchange, the Hutt crime lords, and the Bounty Hunters guild. In the end, Surik was captured by Goto, the Exchange crime boss controlling Nar Shaddaa. In the midst of all this, Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell revealed himself and helped rescue Surik from Goto. \"Goto\", his control over Nar Shaddaa in shamble, joined Surik's party, revealing himself to actually be the droid; G0-T0. Obsessed with order and with no affiliation to any party, G0-T0 sought to use the Exile as an instrument to create order. Fortunately, as G0-T0 was the one who originally placed the bounty on the Jedi in the first place, his joining of their party forced him to rescind it.\nOn Onderon, they became involved with the Onderon Civil War between the hereditary ruler Queen Talia and the isolationist militant upstart General Vaklu. Gaining the aid of the Mandalorians, now led by Canderous Ordo, they managed to end the war, siding with Talia and the royalists. However, they found out that the militant faction led by Vaklu had been receiving aid from the Sith, specifically Darth Nihiluss faction. While the war was ended and Jedi Master Kavar, who had been serving as Talias advisor during the crisis, was freed up to join the gathering on Dantooine.\nOn Korriban, they found the corpse of Lonna Vash in the torture chamber of the Sith Academy. As they prepared to leave, they encountered Darth Sion. After a quick lightsaber duel, they were forced to flee. Sion let them go, feeling that the Jedi Exile had earned the right.\n\n\u2022 Battle of Telos\n\nDuring the Onderon Civil War, Kreia allowed one of General Vaklu's subordinates, the Colonel Tobin, to escape. Tobin fled to Nihilus and told the Sith Lord the information given him by Kreia regarding the existence of the Jedi academy Atris established on Telos. The information was a lie, the only Jedi there was Atris herself while the rest of the residents were Echani handmaidens trained to resist the Force. In any case, Nihilus prepared to attack Telos in order to drain the apparent Jedi Academy and once again sate his hunger.\nAs this took place, Surik traveled to Dantooine and met with the masters. Unfortunately, the masters decided that Suriks condition as a wound in the Force made her a threat to the Force itself, and prepared to use their powers to permanently sever her connection to it. However, before they could do so, Kreia burst in on them. Kreia used the Force to drain their connection to it, killing them. While Surik laid unconscious, Kreia was led to Jedi Master Atris for judgment by one of Suriks companions, the Echani Handmaiden Brianna. Journeying to the Telosian Jedi Academy, Kreia revealed that Atris had herself been corrupted and turned to the dark side by the Sith holocrons she gathered, but could not admit it even to herself. Atris, the new Darth Traya per Kreia's words, then embraced the dark side openly, but was soon confronted and defeated by the Exile.\nWith the new Traya defeated, Surik turned her attention to Darth Nihilus, who had just arrived in-system. While the Republic fleet arrived to hold Nihiluss fleet, Surik boarded the Sith Lords flagship, the Ravager, and with the aid of Canderous Ordo's Mandalorian commandos, they prepared to destroy the ship. As this was done, Surik confronted Darth Nihilus and engaged the Sith Lord in combat.\nThe Sith Lord attempted to absorb Suriks Force energy, however, he failed and exhausted himself. This was due to Suriks natural ability to draw on the Force energy of those around her, mirroring Nihiluss, as a result of her tie to the Force being cut at the end of the Battle of Malachor V. They engaged in a quick fight, with the Dark Lord seemingly too strong to defeat. Then, Surik learned of his aversion to her Force energy signature and turned the tide against him. Nihiluss former apprentice, Visas Marr, now one of Surik's companions, entered a trance and tried to disrupt the link with her former Master, undermining his connection to the Force through their Force bond. Nihilus was defeated, vanishing in a haze of dark side energy.\n\n\u2022 The echo's death\n\nKreia, to Meetra Surik\nKreia returned to the Trayus Academy, subverting Darth Sion and convincing him that she was his master Darth Traya once more. Having reclaimed the forces of the Sith, Kreia waited for Surik. Meetra Surik, following information from Atris, arrived on Malachor and stormed the Sith academy. Fighting her way through the army of Sith assassins and apprentices populating the training center, she confronted Darth Sion at the entrance to the Trayus core.\nAfter a lengthy battle, she convinced the Sith Lord to let go of his rage and allow himself to die. As Sion became that which he appeared to be, he expressed relief at finally leaving the world. Surik entered the core and confronted Kreia. After a discussion where Kreia revealed her disgust towards the idea of the \"Will of the Force\", and her intention to strip the Force of its will, Kreia forced her student into a duel to the death. Their bout abruptly ended when Surik cut off Kreia's remaining hand. However, the Sith used her telekinetic abilities to summon up a trio of lightsabers to assail Surik. Surik managed to cut down the weapons and defeat Kreia. As her mentor died, Meetra Surik was whole; Surik let go of Kreia to remain alive as an individual.\nWhile this took place, one of Bao-Durs droids made its way through the wastes of Malachor V and found the remains of the Mass Shadow Generator in several crashed ships. Reactivating the weapon, the Trayus Academy was destroyed while Surik and her companions managed to escape aboard the salvaged Ebon Hawk'.\nThe threat of the Sith was once again thwarted.\n\n\u2022 The Empires Spy, and Naga Sadows Return\n\nJedi Master Gnost-Dural speaks of the Ovair family\nAlthough the Jedi thought the Sith were defeated, the Sith Empire that Revan had once encountered still existed. In fact, they had planted a Sith infiltrator within the Jedi Order itself, Barel Ovair. Barel selected Eison Gynt to be his Padawan, and together traveled the galaxy studying the Force and accepting the most dangerous of missions for the Order.\nOvair was then given a mission by his superiors; he must destroy all of the long dead spirits of the Sith, who might attempt to challenge the Sith Emperor's return. Thus, the spy and his Padawan undertook the Mission to Yavin 4. The Jedi Order and Gynt believed they were to destroy the spirit of Naga Sadow, which still lingered in his tomb on the planet, in order to finally cleanse the Dark Side planet, so Barel was free to defeat the spirit without hesitation. Unfortunately, the pair was attacked by Massassi warriors that still lived on the surface, and they were forced to retreat into the temple of the dead Sith Lord.\nLater, Ovair returned to Coruscant injured and half-mad. His report to the Jedi Council was that Gynt had been killed during the mission, and the Jedi believed his lies. Eison was indeed alive, and even possessed by the spirit of Naga Sadow. Years later, the possessed Gynt arrived on Coruscant, and immediately challenged his old master to a duel. The two fought, and although Eisons powers were bolstered by Sadows, Ovair was victorious, and slew his ex-Padawan. Ovair was questioned by the Jedi after the fight, but they once again believed him and he was treated as a hero.\n\n\u2022 Resurgence of the Sith Empire\n\n1\nStar Wars: The Old Republic\nIn the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace War, the old Sith Empire was largely decimated by the final conflict between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, and was forced to retreat to the Unknown Regions by the Republic, leading to the belief that the Empire was defeated.\nThe reason for Revans betrayal of the Republic was to strengthen it for its inevitable rematch with the old Sith Empire. However, with his plans largely undone by Malaks rampage, he journeyed into the Unknown Regions to search out the Empire and possibly stem the tide. Whatever his intent or actions, the Sith Empire ultimately returned.\nIt had been three centuries since the Jedi Civil War, Revan's disappearance, and the collapse of the Sith Triumvirate. The Sith were thought long dead, so the invasion came as a total surprise. Their invasion marked the beginning of the decades long Great War.\nThe Sith quickly seized most of the Outer Rim, destroying the Sluis Van shipyards. The battlegrounds spread to include such remote worlds as Ilum or Dathomir. Despite Manaan's attempts to remain neutral, it was ravaged by the Sith, and the Republic suffered further defeats at Agamar and Utapau. However, a heroic struggle at Bothawui helped slow the Sith onslaught, and the Jedi were able to bring the dark-siders advance to a halt in the Mid Rim. It was during this time that the Sith Emperor hatched a plan to capture enemy combatants and program into them his very essence. His apprentice Exal Kressh betrayed him and led a republic attack on the Sith homeworld of Korriban. There she faced Teneb Kel, the Sith apprentice chosen to hunt her down.\nHowever, things for the Republic were vastly complicated by the rebirth of the Mandalorians. In the bloody arenas of Geonosis, a gladiator who called himself the \"New Mandalore\" rose to prominence. The Sith Imperial Intelligence saw a tremendous opportunity in this gladiator. Dispatching agents to rig the arena bouts, they ensured the warriors epic rise to power. Beating all his opponents in the arena, the gladiator claimed the currently defunct title of Mandalore. All surviving Mandalorians answered the New Mandalores call and flocked to his banner. Fulfilling his end of the bargain with the Sith, the New Mandalore command was simple; face the greatest challenge the galaxy has to offer and battle the Jedi Knights. Obviously the plan was to disrupt the Jedi war effort against the Sith.\nIn order to provoke the Jedi, the Mandalorians blockaded the Rimma Trade Route, cutting off supplies to and from the Outer Rim and hurting the war effort against the Sith Empire. Left with no choice, the Jedi were forced to attack the Mandalorian blockade in an attempt to break it. The attack was a total failure, the Jedi were soundly defeated and the Mandalorians continued their blockade. Were it not for the efforts of daring smugglers led by Hylo Visz, the Republic would have fallen much sooner. Visz gathered all the supply ships she could find, loaded them down, and parked them less than a parsec from the Mandalorian fleet. Distracted by the suspicion freighters, the Mandalorians were caught off guard by a joint Republic-smuggler attack, breaking the blockade.\nThe Jedi war effort was able to continue, Visz was hailed as a hero, and the Mandalorians disbanded, the new Mandalore leading some of their number to seek new challenges while the rest returned to mercenary work. Ultimately, the new Mandalore was assassinated and replaced, though the allegiance of the current Mandalore remains ambiguous.\nHowever, due to their delays in the Mid Rim, the Sith tactics became increasingly aggressive and desperate. The Sith Emperor became increasingly impatient, having expected to triumph quickly. In his impatience, he presented a surprising offer to the Republic; a peace treaty. The Jedi Council advised caution, but even they admitted that the war was unwinnable. Peace was the only option.\nWhile diplomats and senators convened on Alderaan for negotiations with the Sith, the dark-siders played their final card. They attacked Coruscant. Using a stolen Republic ship, a group of Sith warriors crash-landed within the entrance to the Jedi Temple itself. Rendezvousing with Darth Malgus, who had arrived just previously, and a Sith-hired bounty hunter who had disabled the Temple security system. Sacking the Temple, they disabled the Coruscant defense mainframe, allowing their forces to land and storm the planet.\nWith the Republics capital firmly in their grip, the Imperial delegation took command of the Alderaan Peace Conference. Lord Baras introduced the Republic diplomats to the Treaty of Coruscant, an agreement greatly biased towards the Sith that would shape galactic events for decades. Although the Jedi Orders representatives protested, Senator Am-Ris agreed to the terms. The war was ended, but Coruscant was subjected to the rule of the Empire's Dark Council for a short time.\nWith the Sith takeover of Coruscant, the Empire now controlled half of the galaxy, and thanks to the Treaty of Coruscant, they were recognized as a legitimate government for the first time in their history. The Jedi and Republic troops were recalled from their many battles, leaving thousands of star systems to fend for themselves under Sith control. With the Jedi Temple on Coruscant ransacked and in ruins, the Jedi Order was forced to relocate, choosing their ancient homeworld of Tython. As the Sith Empire consolidated its power and the Galactic Republic licked its wounds, the Cold War began.\n\n\u2022 The Cold War\n\nCold War]]\nThe Cold War was a period of uncertainty and high tension between the two factions. Border skirmishes and proxy wars between the two powers brought the uneasy truce to the brink of collapse. However, neither side was ready to resume all out war; and the Sith Emperor's interests seemed to turn to something other than conquest. He handed control of the Empire over to his Dark Council, which oversaw the day-to-day affairs of the regime, and went on to pursue his own mysterious goals.\nWhile the Cold War broiled, the Jedi Order reconnected with their roots, and for the most part secluded themselves from galactic affairs, as public opinion had largely turned against them and irate senators blamed them for the war.\nThe Cold War saw two powerful Sith Lords rise to power: Darth Nox and the second Emperors Wrath.\n\n\u2022 Second Great Galactic War\n\nDarth Baras\nThe Second Great Galactic War was the culmination of a dozen years' worth of intense standoffs, uneasy peace and minor border skirmishes and proxy wars. When the galaxy returned to full-scale war, both sides more powerful than they had been previously, the galaxy was torn apart by vicious battles and scheming plots. The Emperor consolidated his power from the shadows, his agents relaying information of galactic events to him while he prepared his plan to annihilate life in the galaxy and gain ultimate supremacy and power.\nThe Second Great Galactic War saw Darth Nox and the Emperors Wrath lead Sith Forces into war, savagely attacking the Republic and battling ferociously with the Jedi. Though the Dark Lords of the Sith often engaged in mortal combat with the Jedi, they also suffered from internal betrayals and other schemes and plots against rivals. This intense rivalry and infighting was put to an end by the Emperors Wrath, thus strengthening the Empire like never before. After the Emperor, Vitiate, was resurrected, he consumed all life on Ziost before fleeing into Wild Space. He secretly built up the Eternal Empire, which invaded the galaxy and subjected the Sith Empire and Republic, until a war hero rose up, and with the help of the Sith Lana Beniko and Republic SIS agent Theron Shan, created the Eternal Alliance that toppled the Empire and slew Vitiate. The Sith Empire would later engage in the third Galactic War with the Republic.\n\n\u2022 Desolous's Insurgence\n\nMore than one hundred years after the fall of the Eternal Empire and the third Galactic War, a Pauan Force-sensitive was discovered by the Jedi. Brought into the order, he eventually became a revered and powerful Jedi Master. However, his innate lust for battle drove him to seek out Sith teachings, which forced the Jedi to expel him from the order.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\nThe master declared himself Dark Lord of the Sith and took on the name Darth Desolous. Desolous returned home to Utapau and proceeded to build an army around him, training hundreds of fellow Pau'ans in a personalized version of Jedi fighting techniques and equipping them with Cortosis alloy shields. He then rallied his army and embarked on a bloody campaign against the Jedi Order. Using ambush and guerrilla fighting tactics, Desolous and his army ultimately slaughtered over two thousand Jedi.\nHowever, with each victory, Desolous grew increasingly reckless and bold, his hatred of the Jedi eclipsing all other emotions, or reason. In his recklessness, Desolous allowed himself and his army to be drawn into a trap at Yaga Minor, where he and his army were destroyed.\nIn 2975 BBY, the two surviving Sith factions on Kesh, the Lost Tribe of the Sith and the Doomed clashed in a conflict that culminated with the dissolution of the Doomed, and the reawakening and death of Dreypa.\n\n\u2022 The New Sith Wars\n\n\u2022 Ruin\n\nEchoes of the Jedi\nSeveral hundred years after the fall of Darth Desolous, another charismatic and revered Jedi Master fell to the Dark side and recreated the Sith. This time, it was the Umbaran Phanius, a renegade master known for a disturbing philosophy, which included elements of moral relativism and solipsism, possibly echoed in certain aspects by the much later Potentium belief.Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\nLeaving the Jedi Order to pursue prohibited Sith teachings, Phanius became the first of what would be known as the Lost Twenty. The newly christened Darth Ruin set about recreating the Sith, uniting the various splinter factions that remained from the Old Sith Wars and the Cold War, and gaining the allegiance of fifty turn-coat Jedi Knights in an event known as the Fourth Great Schism. Ruin proceeded to initiate the New Sith Wars against the Jedi.\nHowever, his newfound power was not to last. Ruin, in his all-consuming ambition and single-minded hatred of the Jedi, caused the deaths of thousands of his own followers, sometimes on a whim. Ultimately, Ruin's actions led to the betrayal of his followers, and he was assassinated. However, the New Sith Wars continued on and off for almost a millennium.\n\n\u2022 The Dark Underlord\n\nFollowing the death of Darth Ruin, several Dark Lords rose to power and reorganized the Sith, renewing war against the Republic. One of the first after Ruin was a mysterious being known only as the Dark Underlord. Theories regarding his true identity often gravitated towards him being a Sith spirit summoned from Chaos, some even stating that he was the resurrection of the Lettow General Xendor.\nDuring the first quarter of the war, the Underlord was a bloody marauder who earned the ire of the Republic. Attaining leadership of the Sith, the Underlord consolidated a number of elite Sith warriors known as the Black Knights. Setting up a base on Malrev IV, they continued the war against the Republic.\nAs the Dark Underlord fought the Republic, he found a nemesis in the Jedi General Murrtaggh. The Jedi General, in a scheme to infiltrate the Underlords fortress on Malrev IV, hired a group of Mandalorian mercenaries to stage a diversionary attack while he broke into the fortress and assassinated the Underlord. Murrtagghs plan was ultimately successful, but at a terrible price. He confronted the Underlord and slew him, but fell to the Dark side as he struck down the Dark Lord.\n\n\u2022 Rivan\n\nDarth Rivan\nSometime after the fall of the Dark Underlord, a Zelosian Sith Lord christened Darth Rivan rose to power. Rivan settled on the planet Almas, and built a fortress on the world. However, unlike many of his predecessors who devoted themselves to war against the Republic, Rivan's primary occupation was study. His goal was to find a way to eliminate the inherent infighting amongst the Sith, as enlightened cooperation was not considered a virtue amongst Darksiders.\nRivans researches turned his fortress into a massive focal point of Dark side energy, and resulted in the creation of the Sith battlelords. The battlelords successfully implemented Rivans goal of eliminating infighting by causing a Force-bond to form between a commander and all of his subordinates, ensuring that whenever a subordinate attempted to assassinate his superior officer, the damage would instead be inflicted upon the soldier.\nRivan's other researches resulted in the creation of the Kaluthin grass, which modified the toxic landscape and atmosphere of Almas, terraforming the planet into a gardenlike paradise. At some point, he also gained possession of an artifact known as the Darkstaff, an insidious semi-sentient weapon capable of draining the Force essence from living beings.\nIt was initially believed that Rivan was betrayed and killed by his own apprentice, Darsin, after being driven off Almas by a joint Republic/Jedi assault. In truth, the Darkstaff created a massive Force storm that swept across the surface of Almas and transported Rivan through space and time to Ruusan during the final battle of the New Sith Wars several centuries later. He perished in the battle, being left extremely weakened by the journey.\nUntil the rise of Darth Bane in the very same battle that resulted in his death, he was the last Sith Lord known to use the \"Darth\" title.\n\n\u2022 Darzu\n\nDarth Zannah]]\nSome time after Rivans fall, a new Dark Lord known as Belia Darzu rose to power. Prior to her ascendance, the Shiido Darzu was a Dark Side Marauder and a Sith Alchemist. As Dark Lord, Darzu made the ancient Jedi world of Tython her seat of power, building a fortress and the planet and commencing with her alchemic experimentations, saturating the world with the Dark Side.\nAmong her creations was a suit of heavy battle armor that was imbued with the Dark Side, granting the wearer invisibility and enhanced physical strength. However, possibly Darzus most insidious creation was her personal army of Technobeasts, creatures whom she had mutated into twisted mechanical versions of their former selves through a combination of Nanogene technology and the Dark side of the Force. She controlled this army through the use of the Sith alchemic technique Mechu-deru.\nBelia Darzu was ultimately assassinated by Sith of the Mecrosa Order, who had her poisoned at the behest of her fellow Sith Lords. Though she died, her knowledge survived in the form of her many notes and journals left intact within her fortress, and her holocron, all of which later came into the possession of Darth Bane.\n\n\u2022 Brotherhood of Darkness\n\nDue to the constant infighting amongst the Sith, their Empire was fractured into numerous pieces. Self-proclaimed Sith Lords rose to establish their own personal domains, while enslaved masses suffered under the rule of these warlords. Despite this division however, the Republic and the Jedi Order were both too weakened by their off-and-on conflicts with the Sith for them to capitalize on it. With the Republic crumbling due simply to a lack of infrastructure, the Mid and Outer Rims became lawless free-fire zones that, more often than not, were absorbed into the territories of various Sith warlords. In response to the lack of Republic and Jedi intervention against the Sith, many individual Jedi began personal campaigns to free oppressed worlds from the Sith. In the instances where they succeeded, they were often granted Feudal-styled control over the area they freed by their grateful populaces. These Jedi Lords eventually became so popular and powerful that they created their own council to oversee their affairs, completely ignoring the Jedi High Council. In an attempt to regain their authority and popularity, the High Council fielded their own champion, the charismatic and powerful Skere Kaan. However, Kaan believed that the Jedi were responsible for the chaos that plagued the galaxy, and defected with a group of like-minded Jedi to the Sith cause. However, unlike his fellows who were more concerned with establishing personal dominance, Kaan focused on bringing down the ailing Republic. To this end, he set about uniting the various factions of the Empire under a single banner.\nKaan's plan to unite the Empire was unique in Sith history. Rather than individually challenge each of the Dark Lords to gain possession of their forces, Kaan instead acquiesced to their vanity, naming them all Dark Lords of the Sith and declaring them equal within the Empire. Advocating cooperation and unity within the Sith, Kaan ended the age-old power struggle and gained the backing of all the Dark Lords, who swore loyalty to him.\nThanks to Kaans efforts, the Sith Empire was reorganized into the Brotherhood of Darkness, and in a political sense, was now more united and stronger than before. Under Kaans leadership, the Brotherhood set about destroying the Republic, securing the galaxy for the Sith.\n\n\u2022 Sith Campaigns\n\nKaan\nNow united under a single banner and with a common goal in mind, the Sith onslaught was vicious and inexorable. Gaining a startling victory at Korriban, the Sith reclaimed the Sith tombworld and reopened the Sith academy. Kaan installed several of his lieutenants as the leaders, with Lord Qordis serving as headmaster.\nSoon after, Kaan moved on to his next target; Ruusan. This world was largely insignificant save for its strategic placement. Kaan planned on using Ruusan as the staging area for the Sith invasion of the Core worlds. The first battle of Ruusan was a total Sith victory, with the Republic forces routed and annihilated thanks to Kaan's battle meditation. As they prepared to launch their invasion, Kaan easily repelled the Republic counter-attack.\nHowever, in the subsequent battles of the war, Kaan noticed a disturbing absence of Jedi. This absence was explained when Ruusan was suddenly attacked by the Jedi Army of Light, led by Lord Hoth. The Sith forces were driven off-planet, though Kaan quickly moved to retake the world. Thus began the protracted Ruusan campaign.\nDuring this series of battles, both the Jedi and the Sith began to unravel, members of both groups beginning to lose faith in their leaders. It was into this hostile climate that Darth Bane emerged.\n\n\u2022 The Rise of Darth Bane\n\n\u2022 Bane's emergence\n\nThe man who would eventually become Darth Bane was born on the Republic mining world of Apatros. Dessel was born to an abusive father and cortosis miner named Hurst. Bullied by his father and the other miners, Dessel became a highly aggressive though cunning individual, fighting back until they left him alone. Known by the derogatory nickname \"Bane\", given by his father to the \"bane of his existence\", Dessel eventually learned to ignore the jibes and insults directed at him by the other miners.\nHowever, Dessel was challenged to a fight one day by one of his now dead father's friends; Gerd; Dessel bit off the drunken miners thumb. Suspended from work, Dessel went to the local cantina a little earlier than usual, beating the crowds. There, he got into a game of Sabacc with a group of off-duty Republic officers. Offended by his casually veiled insults, and enraged that Dessel won, they attacked him as he left. Dessel killed one of them in the ensuing fight.\nKnowing that the Republic officials would imprison him for killing the officer even though he was the aggressor, Dessel fled the planet and joined the Sith army. Rising to the rank of Sergeant in the Gloom Walkers unit, Dessels skill as a soldier, along with his unconscious use of the Force, caused the unit to become one of the most famous in the military. However, during the Battle of Phaseera, the unit was sent on a suicide mission. The units CO, Ulabore, was too terrified of the Sith Lords to consider questioning the order, so Dessel incapacitated him and took command.\nThough the mission was successful, Ulabore had Dessel taken to be court-martialed. However, he was intercepted by the Sith Lord Kopecz, who had him sent to the Sith academy on Korriban instead. Presented with an offer to join the ranks of the Dark Lords, Dessel accepted. As a sign that he had cast off his old identity, Dessel took on the derogatory nickname his father had for him, becoming Bane.\n\n\u2022 Training on Korriban\n\nBane immediately began his training under the masters of the academy. On his own initiative, he studied the academy archives for ancient lore, something discouraged by the current masters, who emphasized their difference rather than attempted to continue the old ways. Eventually, Bane began to abandon his studies in the archives to focus on physical and mental exercises. Challenging one of his fellow students; Fohargh; to a sparring bout, Bane was beaten, though he killed his opponent with the Force in a blind rage.\nHowever, his killing of Fohargh caused him to think back on the death of his father, and Bane suddenly realized that he had unconsciously killed his father. This revelation caused him to doubt his ability, and Bane began losing his connection to the Dark Side. This caused his progress to slip, and after a disastrous failure in a sparring match, Bane was denied the right to train with the other students.\nAs he could no longer attend classes, Bane resumed his studies in the archives. As he learned of the ancient Sith and their ways, Bane began to question the edicts of the Brotherhood of Darkness. However, he continued to despair in his own abilities, and it was only the intervention of Githany that kicked him out of his stupor.\nGithany was a Jedi deserter who had provided the Sith with intelligence on the Jedi movements in exchange for membership. Taking her place at the academy, her Jedi training provided her with an edge over the other students, and she became one of the foremost apprentices. A primary obstacle towards her advancement, however, was Sirak. Sirak was the top student at the academy, and the only individual skilled enough to cause her worry.\nGithany saw the opportunity to destroy Sirak in Bane, and approached him. The two formed an alliance, and Githany began providing Bane with the training he was forced to miss out on, helping Bane regain his connection to the Dark side, though he continued to play the weakling to keep Siraks guard down. While receiving training in Force techniques from Githany, Bane also met with the Academy swordmaster; Kasim; receiving lightsaber instruction from him. Thanks to the efforts of these two teachers, whom Bane kept secret from one another, he gained sufficient power and skill to challenge Sirak. The bout was an unprecedented victory for Bane, and Sirak suffered his first defeat. However, Bane allowed Sirak to live, shaking Githanys and Kasim's faith in him.\nDespite this, Bane was now the top student at the academy.\n\n\u2022 Rebellion\n\nAfter his bout with Sirak, Bane was approached by Lord Qordis. The headmaster revealed that he had been aware of the secret training Bane received from Kasim and Githany for some time, and saluted Banes progress. However, he also ordered Bane to cease studying the Sith archives, citing the Brotherhood's efforts to \"seek a new path\" rather than continue the old ways.\nEnraged by this, Bane traveled to Valley of the Sith Lords and began inspecting the tombs, looking for some way to prove Qordis wrong and validate the old ways. Finding nothing, he determined that the current Sith were too weak to deserve the wisdom of the ancients, and the old Sith spirits had abandoned them. Returning to the academy, he was ambushed by a vengeful Sirak, along with Sirak's two lackeys, and Githany. However, Githany changed allegiances halfway through the fight, aiding Bane in killing Sirak.\nShortly afterwards, the academy received word of the disastrous Ruusan campaign. As the Sith forces were in dire need of reinforcements, all the students immediately graduated and granted the rank of Dark Lord. However, Bane refused to accompany his fellow students, abandoning his mentors and rebelling against the Brotherhood.\nAs a sign of his difference, Bane claimed the forbidden and defunct title of Darth. Darth Bane proceeded to steal Lord Qordis's ship and left Korriban.\n\n\u2022 The Holocron of Darth Revan\n\nFollowing coordinates he discovered in the Korriban archives, Darth Bane traveled to the Unknown Regions, to Lehon. Landing on the Unknown World, Bane dominated a Rancor beast through Force persuasion, travelling to the Rakatan Temple of the Ancients. Entering, Bane began combing the structure for relics and artifacts. Eventually, his search led him to the sublevels. There he discovered a secret compartment in the central chamber containing the holocron of Darth Revan.\nOpening the device, Bane was given access to a plethora of information on the ancient Sith and their abilities. Bane managed to create a personal library of handwritten records of the information before the holocrons power cell depleted, receiving a final message from Darth Revan. Using Revan's knowledge and teachings as inspiration, Bane came to believe that the Force, specifically the Dark Side, was finite, and that the Brotherhood of Darkness, in addition to disregarding traditional Sith beliefs, was spreading the Dark Side too thinly. Bane became determined to destroy the Brotherhood and reform the Sith, in accordance with his own philosophy; the Rule of Two. This new edict reduced Sith numbers to merely two individuals; the master and the apprentice. To ensure a line of secession, the apprentice would eventually assassinate and replace the master after learning all he could, before taking an apprentice of his own, continuing the Sith.\nWhile Bane made his revelations, the Brotherhood of Darkness was worried by his absence from their ranks, as he had been one of their most powerful members. Kaan, fearful of Banes intentions after Githany told him of a vision she experienced, dispatched Kasim to Lehon with an ultimatum, \"join us or die\".\nKasim followed the homing beacon in Banes ship, which Bane had not bothered to deactivate, finding the \"wayward\" Dark Lords landing site. Confronting Bane in the Temple of the Ancients, the two had a brief, heated discussion, which ended in conflict. In the ensuing lightsaber duel, Kasim almost managed to defeat Bane with his knowledge of dual-saber combat, which Bane had not received training in. However, in the end, Bane prevailed, demolishing the Temple of the Ancients with a massive Force blast while Kasim was still inside.\nUsing Kasims death as the excuse, Bane began playing the weakling again, using this facade to deceive the Brotherhood into believing that he was ready to rejoin them, sending some of his records from Revans holocron as proof of his sincerity. Meeting with Githany on Ambria, Bane was almost killed by her, being poisoned by a sample of the toxin synox Githany covered her lips with when they shared a kiss. Too weakened to heal himself, Bane rushed across the Ambrian desert to the hut of the healer; Caleb. Taking Calebs daughter hostage, Bane forced the man to treat him. Cured by the healer, Bane allowed him to live, feeling that he could be a useful contact in the future.\nWith that, Bane departed for Ruusan.\n\n\u2022 Destruction of the Brotherhood of Darkness\n\nArriving on Ruusan during the aftermath of the fifth battle of the campaign, Darth Bane stormed in on the Dark Lords during a strategic briefing. Disgusted by Kaans mindset, Bane accused him of thinking like a dirt general rather than a proper Sith Lord. Kaan decided to accept Banes tactical advise, and the Dark Lords gathered together in a ritual led by Bane, unleashing a Dark Side fueled wave of destruction upon the Jedi forces.\nWhile the attack itself was a total success, the Dark Lords sensed Darth Banes intention, and broke the ritual, attacking the Jedi personally while their forces were in disarray. Bane, though enraged by their initiative, took advantage of the situation to thin their number. While the Dark Lords led the assault, Bane went to Kaans tent and used his communication equipment to order the Sith fleet to attack the Jedi fleet, breaking the Sith blockade and allowing the Jedi to send reinforcements. The Sith were unexpectedly attacked and forced to flee. Before the Sith arrived back at camp, Bane was approached by Qordis, who sought to join Bane. Bane flatly refused and killed Qordis.\nConfronted by Kaan, Bane pretended to be dominated by Kaan's Force persuasion, and manipulated Kaan into preparing the Thought Bomb. The Thought Bomb was an ancient Sith weapon of terrible power, a massive focus of Dark Side energy that when detonated would cause mass devastation across a wide area, and kill any powerful Force-sensitives in the area. However, Kaan was unaware that the weapon would also kill the creators, namely the Sith Lords of the Brotherhood.\nThe Sith forces and the Dark Lords all retreated to a massive network of caves and gathered in the central chamber. Kaan, using Bane's records, led the ritual, creating the Thought Bomb. When confronted by a group of Jedi led by Lord Hoth, Kaan detonated the bomb.\nThe Brotherhood of Darkness was destroyed.\n\n\u2022 Rule of Two\n\n\u2022 Darth Bane's reign\n\n\u2022 Early Actions\n\nOne of Bane's first actions in the aftermath of Ruusan was to search out an apprentice. He found his disciple in the form of the young girl Zannah. After terrorizing a group of surviving Sith mercenaries to create easily discredited rumors of a surviving Dark Lord, allowing the Sith to remain hidden, he tasked Zannah with finding a way to Onderon, on her own, as a test. Abandoning her on the Ruusan battlefield, Bane departed for the planet himself.\nHowever, along the way, he was suddenly accosted by the spirits of Qordis and Kaan, both of whom had somehow found a way to escape the Thought Bomb. Provoked by them, Bane accidentally crippled his ship and crash-landed on the Onderonian moon; Dxun. Wandering through the wilderness, Bane came upon the Tomb of Freedon Nadd. Investigating it, he managed to gain entry, procuring Nadds holocron. However, before he could exit the tomb, he was attacked by a swarm of orbalisks that had colonized the tomb. They latched themselves to his body, but instead of parasitically feeding on it, they instead fed upon his Dark Side energy. The two formed a symbiotic relationship, the orbalisks got to feast on Banes energy, sustaining themselves, while they formed a set of nigh-impervious bio-organic armor for him, and they served as repositories of Dark Side energy that he could draw on at will.\nUsing their power, he dominated one of the Dxun beasts to serve as his steed. Thanks to virtue of season, Bane had arrived on Dxun during the period where the atmospheres of the moon and Onderon overlapped. Pushing his steed to the limit, Bane made for Onderon.\nWhile Bane fought through his ordeal on Dxun, Zannah made her way to Onderon by hijacking a Republic vessel and killing the crew with a stolen blaster. Crash-landing on Onderon, she was ambushed by a clan of beast-riders. Before they could kill her, Darth Bane arrived. The beast-riders were slaughtered. Bane was impressed by Zannah's ability, and officially made her his apprentice.\n\n\u2022 Zannah's apprenticeship\n\nDarth Bane and Zannah settled on Ambia on the shores of Lake Natth, a focus of Dark Side energy on the planet. Over the next decade, Bane trained Zannah in the arts of patience, secrecy and deception. Zannah herself developed a talent for Sith sorcery, becoming a skilled illusionist. Bane's abilities as a duelist also rubbed off on Zannah, and she developed into a formidable combatant in her own right.\nWhile he trained Darth Zannah, Bane utilized records stolen from the Brotherhood of Darkness to gain access to Lord Qordiss bank accounts, making off with the late Sith Lords considerable funds. Using these credits, Bane began manipulating galactic politics, working through a variety of intermediates and middle-men. Bane began stirring up a variety of anti-Republic terrorist organizations, in order to distract the Jedi from investigating Sith rumors and keep the Republic united, ensuring that the Sith only had a single target to focus on, and to set the stage for the eventual Sith takeover.\nBane also dispatched Zannah to infiltrate the Anti Republic Liberation Front, one of the more prominent terrorist groups, based on Serenno. Zannahs mission was successful, and she brought about the groups destruction. However, she also gained the attention of the groups reclusive leader; Hetton. Hetton was a Serenno nobleman and self-taught Sith acolyte. When he discovered Zannahs identity as a Sith Lord, he immediately begged her to make him her apprentice.\nZannah seemingly agreed, and took Hetton and his entourage of Sith assassins to Ambria, supposedly to assassinate Darth Bane. Bane easily held off the attack, and killed Hetton. Zannah then revealed to Bane that the assassination attempt was a manipulation to eliminate Hetton and test Bane, and that the ultimate goal had been gaining the possession of Hetton's collection of Sith artifacts.\nWhile they gained a massive number of Sith equipment, Bane was still unsatisfied. He had been seeking to create a holocron, but had been repeatedly undone supposedly by the effects of the orbalisks, who enhanced his rage but inhibited his concentration. Bane dispatched Zannah to infiltrate the Jedi temple and gain access to the archives, so he might find a way to remove the orbalisks. While Zannah did this, Bane departed for Tython to search out Belia Darzu's fortress, and her holocron.\n\n\u2022 Near Disaster on Tython\n\nDarth Bane landed on Tython and successfully infiltrated the fortress of Belia Darzu, evading the still active defenses. Making his way to the central chamber, he fought his way through her hordes of remaining technobeasts and retrieved her holocron. Studying the artifact, he discovered that his failure at creating a holocron had been due to design flaws on his part, rather than the orbalisks hindering his efforts. While Zannah sought out information on orbalisks in the Jedi archives, Bane began to rethink his decision to remove them.\nWhile Zannah successfully found the information she was looking for, she also encountered her cousin; Darovit. As children, Zannah and Darovit had been recruited by the Jedi to help in the Ruusan campaign. However, their ship was shot down as they came in to land, and the two were separated. Darovit had been found by the Jedi, though he shortly afterwards defected to the Sith, while Zannah had wandered the wilderness for several days before being found by Bane. In the aftermath of Ruusan, Darovit became the Healing Hermit, devoting himself to helping Ruusan recover from the war as a penance for his own actions.\nWhen a Republic construction team led by Johun Othone arrived on Ruusan to construct a memorial to the battle, Darovit was enraged, seeing this action as opening an old wound. Sabotaging their efforts, Darovit gained the attention of Othone, who pursued him back to his dwelling. Knowing that the game was up, Darovit surrendered. As the two spoke, Darovit revealed the survival of the Sith. After the battle of Ruusan, Darovit had encountered Bane and Zannah after the Thought Bombs detonation before they left. Zannah, as a final act of mercy, used the Force to destroy Darovits right hand, disarming him, but indirectly sparing his life, as Bane no longer saw him as a threat. Bane allowed him to live, feeling that no one would believe the word of a traitor if Darovit tried reporting the Sith Lords existence.\nOthone brought Darovit to the Jedi Temple to testify before the Jedi Council. However, while Othone set up an appointment with the Council, Darovit encountered Zannah in the archives while researching herbal lore. Zannah, having found the information she needed, abducted him and fled the planet. However, Darovits absence was immediately noticed, and Othone managed to convince several Masters to accompany him in pursuit of Zannah. However, they had no time to inform any others of Darth Banes survival.\nZannah met Bane on Tython, with Darovit in tow. Convincing Bane to allow Darovit to live, as his abilities as a healer could aid them in removing the orbalisks, they prepared to confront the Jedi. Retreating to a large chamber deep in Belia Darzu's fortress, they stashed their artifacts and information in a small side room, along with Darovit, and prepared to meet the Jedi.\nValenthyne Farfalla and Raskta Lsu took Bane, and Othone and Sarro Xaj attacked Zannah, while Master Worror Dowmat held back and reinforced them with Battle Meditation. Despite Dowmats aid, the Jedi were unable to bring down the Dark Lords, Banes orbalisk armor protecting him from their lightsaber strikes, enabling him to focus solely on offense, while Zannahs defensive technique proved adequate to hold off Xaj, whose efforts were being hindered by Othones rusty skills. However, when Othone broke off to attack Bane, Xaj was able to take full advantage of his skills, gaining ground on Zannah.\nBane, attempting to halt the Jedis advance, attacked Dowmat. While Farfalla managed to save Dowmat from Bane, he also disrupted his Battle Meditation, distracting the Jedi and allowing Zannah to slay Xaj. Freed up to help Bane, Zannah impaled Lsu while Bane decapitated Farfalla and gouged out Dowmats throats. As Bane prepared to execute Othone with a blast of Force lightning, Worror used the last of his strength to encase the Dark Lord in a Force shield, causing the lightning to backfire upon Bane.\nThis revealed a major weakness in the orbalisks; they were unable to withstand electrical bursts, and were killed by the lightning. As they died, they released a toxic excretion into Banes body that would leave him dead within days unless treated. Finishing Othone herself, Zannah quickly loaded Banes dying body onto their ship, along with Darovit and their gathered artifacts and information and rushed to Ambria.\nMeeting with the healer, Caleb, whom Bane had earlier relied on when Githany had poisoned him, Zannah attempted to extort him. However, Caleb was unconcerned with any of Zannahs threats, as his daughter was all that mattered to him, and he had already sent her away. While Zannah despaired, Darovit convinced Caleb to heal Bane, on the condition that Zannah allow them to send a message to the Jedi informing them of Banes existence, his location, and his helpless state. While Darovit hoped the Jedi would take Zannah and Bane into custody, and allow Zannah to redeem herself, the Sith apprentice had other ideas.\nAllowing them to send the message, which was written and delivered by message drone, Zannah waited until they healed Bane and then struck. Zannah dismembered Caleb and used her abilities to drive Darovit insane before hiding herself and Bane. The Jedi arrived soon after and found Calebs remains. Attacked by the maddened Darovit, they quickly brought him down. Assuming Darovit to be the Dark Lord, they believed that he had brought down the masters on Tython single-handedly, but was wounded, and his attempts to heal himself through the Dark Side backfired. They believed that Caleb had been killed by \"Bane\" when he sought treatment and discovered that Caleb had sent the message to the Jedi. Collecting Calebs remains for burial, the Jedi departed, satisfied that the Sith were finally defeated, and glorified the encounter as the \"Fall of Darth Bane\".Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith novelization\n\n\u2022 Later Actions\n\nBanes efforts to construct a holocron would eventually come to fruition, this artifact eventually finding its way into the possession of Darth Krayt, though it would be of little use to him.Legacy' (2006) 5\nHowever, as ten years passed, Zannah failed to make an attempt on Banes life, and the Dark Lord began to become concerned with her worthiness. Worried that she might be unable to succeed him, Bane set about searching for the long lost holocron of Darth Andeddu, and the means for achieving immortality.Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil'\nHowever, when Bane gained the holocron and studied its immortal ways, it was stolen by Set Harth, who was once the apprentice of Zannah while trying to help her kill Bane. Bane then took an Iktotchi assassin dubbed Darth Cognus, but destroyed his own body from what he had read from Andeddus holocron and seemingly himself in Zannahs body. Cognus then apprenticed herself to Darth Zannah, who was now the official Dark Lord of the Sith. Eventually, Cognus would rise to take her mistress' place and the rank of Sith Master.\n\n\u2022 Darth Cognus's reign\n\nDarth Cognus was a member of the Sith Order who attained power from her mentor, Zannah. As Sith Master, she took as her apprentice an individual named Millennial, a three-eyed mutant human and a powerful Force-sensitive.\n\n\u2022 Millennial's Rebellion\n\nMillennial proved to be an able apprentice, trained as a Shadow Hand by Cognus and possessing powerful precognitive abilities. However, Millennial and Cognus disagreed on several points, most notably on the continued application of the Rule of Two.\nCognus was a staunch believer in the philosophy, training Millennial accordingly. The mutant apprentice, on the other hand, believed the doctrine to be too restrictive, instead supporting the more martial Rule of the Strong, which tolerated the presence of numerous Sith Lords, the leader being the strongest. The two clashed many times over this issue, and tensions eventually reached a boiling point.\nCognus ended Millennial's training and cast him out. Whether this was a brutal execution attempt or a simple expulsion remains unknown, but either way, Millennial fled. While Cognus took a new apprentice and continued the Rule of Two, Millennial settled on Dromund Kaas and founded the Sith splinter cult known as Dark Force.\n\n\u2022 Darth Vectivus's Reign\n\nThe man who eventually became Darth Vectivus started out as a simple businessman, a shrewd but fair-minded individual. Taking control of a mining operation near Bimmiel, he discovered that he was a latent Force-sensitive, and began feeling Dark side energy permeating the mine. As he researched and learned from these energies, they also began adversely affecting the miners and contaminating the ore, forcing him to close the facility.Legacy of the Force: Betrayal\nAs he was now freed up without needing to manage his business operation, the man began journeying the galaxy seeking knowledge on the Force. He eventually came into contact with the Order of the Sith Lords, and was apprenticed. Becoming Darth Vectivus, he managed to keep control of himself, relying on his staunch ethical code to prevent becoming corrupted by the Dark Side. Becoming the Sith Master, Vectivus returned to the mine, building a mansion on the sight and living out his life happily surrounded by family and friends.\nVectivus remained an oddity among Sith, as he was not a power-hungry, rage driven schemer, but just an ordinary man.\n\n\u2022 Darth Plagueis's Reign\n\nThe Muun Plagueis reigned around the time of 60 BBY. Born on Mygeeto as Hego Damask, Darth Tenebrous, known as Rugess Nome found him actually before he was born. Though it is also known that he was a mystic obsessed with immortality. Thanks to the longevity his species possessed, he spent over a lifetime searching for such secrets. They came in the form of the ability to manipulate the midi-chlorians within a being to prevent death, and create life, in the form of a spontaneously generated pregnancy.The New Essential Chronology\n\n\u2022 Sidious's Apprenticeship\n\nDarth Plagueis was eventually ambushed by a Bith who claimed Sith Lordship, calling himself Darth Venamis. Trained by Darth Tenebrous in violation of the Rule of Two, Venamis engaged Plagueis in a lightsaber duel and was defeated by the Muun Dark Lord. Having appropriated the Biths available resources, Plagueis discovered a list of Force-sensitives whom Venamis was scouting as potential apprentices. He sought them out himself, and in the course of his search he took an interest in the teenage son of a nobleman on the planet Naboo, an intelligent but arrogant young human of extraordinary Force potential named Palpatine. Plagueis was superficially motivated by a desire to exploit Naboos wealth of plasma, but in Palpatine he saw a far greater opportunity. After realizing the boys Force-sensitivity and cultivating his interest in the dark sides power, Plagueis manipulated him into murdering his own family, thereby initiating him into the fold of the Sith. Darth Plagueis dubbed Palpatine Darth Sidious and began the youth's training in earnest. At last, the Muun Dark Lord had found a satisfactory implement for setting the Grand Plan of the Sith in motion: Palpatine was actively involved in politics already, being that public service is mandatory for Naboo youth, and as such, Darth Plagueis saw an opportunity to dismantle the Galactic Republic from within. The young Palpatine would slowly climb the political ladder until absolute power was eventually his, and all who stood in his way would be eliminated. The Grand Plan was now underway; nevertheless, the Muun never abandoned a pet project of his, an experiment in midi-chlorian manipulation engendered to preserve his reign indefinitely.\nAside from his own immortality, he also planned to create a pregnancy within a woman that would result in the most powerful Force-sensitive ever known. But unfortunately for Plagueis, Sidious suspected that his master was creating a replacement, the ultimate Sith apprentice. Many years later, having never lost sight of these suspicions, Sidious (now the newly elected Supreme Chancellor of the Republic) murdered Plagueis in his sleep, having plied his master with intoxicants on the pretext of celebrating his new chancellorship. After decades of learning from Darth Plagueis the Wise, the man who would become known as Palpatine the Great was now Dark Lord of the Sith.\n\n\u2022 Darth Sidious's Reign\n\n\u2022 Maul's Apprenticeship\n\nSometime during his young adulthood, while still apprenticed to Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious was given custody of an infant Zabrak named Maul by the baby's mother, a Nightsister of Dathomir who sought to spare her son the ordeal of his Nightbrother obligations. Sidious reluctantly took the infant into his charge, planning to train the child as an apprentice of his own. It was not altogether surprising; due to the martial prowess and Force sensitivity common to the Zabrak species, they were long a subject of interest to the Sith empires of old, these groups often spending ridiculous sums of money to hire Zabrak mercenaries. However, nothing could have prepared Maul for the brutal treatment he received from Sidious.\nMaul was subjected to numerous physical tests and training regiments, many of which bordered on torture. The goal of this vicious treatment was to strip Maul of his compassion and humility, turning him into a rage-fueled Sith killer. In the end, Sidious achieved his goal, and Maul became a powerful Sith Lord who demonstrated great martial prowess.\nAs a final test, Sidious abandoned Maul on a remote and isolated world, where he was relentlessly hunted by his assassin droids. After leaving him to survive for a month, Sidious confronted the Zabrak and challenged him. Despite Mauls best efforts, he was defeated, and Sidious taunted that he had trained a new apprentice during the interim period, a replacement for Maul. The enraged Zabrak resumed fighting with renewed vigor, and even though he was defeated, he still passed Sidiouss test.Star Wars Journal: Darth Maul\nDarth Sidious declared his apprentices training complete and dubbed him Darth Maul, Dark Lord of the Sith. Though this could be construed as a violation of the Rule of Two, Darth Sidious had informed Darth Plagueis of Mauls impending lordship, and indeed, had trained the Zabrak with Plagueiss permission. Moreover, Maul was never trained as a true Sith Lord, but rather as a Sith assassin, used for assignments deemed too risky for Sidious to undertake himself, lest he endanger his political ascension. Despite his success with Mauls training, Sidious regarded him as little more than a placeholder for his eventual target.\n\n\u2022 The Phantom Menace\n\n.]]\nWhile Sidious trained Maul, he also set about preparing for the ultimate revenge of the Sith. Using his alter ego; Palpatine; Sidious infiltrated the halls of power, starting as a relatively low-level politician on his native Naboo, and worked his way up. Sidious ensured that his rise was relatively slow, rather than an alarming meteoric rise to power that would attract his enemy's attention.\nIn 52 BBY, Palpatine had the current Chommell sector Senator; Vidar Kim; assassinated. His complicity in the killing was never discovered, as the assassin committed suicide while being interrogated by Kims Jedi son; Ronhar. In a demonstration of his cunning, Palpatine befriended Ronhar Kim during the late-Senator Kims funeral, gaining a contact, and an unwitting pawn. Palpatine would use Ronhar Kim in a scheme that resulted in the creation of the Red Guard, and Kims death during the Clone Wars would be used as propaganda to further Palpatines power grab.Republic 64\nWith Vidar Kim out of the way, Palpatine assumed his place in the Galactic Senate of the Republic. Many of the power-brokers and Coruscanti politicians looked down on provincial delegates like Palpatine, believing such hopefuls would be overwhelmed by the complexity and enormity of galactic politics. Palpatine encouraged this opinion, as it made him harder to notice, and thereby less threatening.\nHowever, Palpatines quiet position gained him many friends within the Senate, and he became increasingly popular. He was also an avid writer, and many of Palpatines publications and theories about political science were taught at leading universities. However, despite Palpatine's fame and popularity, he remained unassuming, devoting all his time to his work, and to furthering his Sith agenda.\nPart of the preparation for his ultimate rise was to engineer the assassination of the Trade Federation directorate. Thanks to his contact and ally, Wilhuff Tarkin, the directorate was destroyed in a pirate raid on Eriadu, where they had gathered for a summit. This allowed for the Neimodians to take advantage of the situation and take over the Federation. The new leader of the corporation was the Viceroy; Nute Gunray.\nOnce this was done, Palpatine supported the Senate resolution BR-0371, which caused many of the Galactic trade routes to have taxes levied on them. The Trade Federation was outraged, and was approached by Darth Sidious in short order. Sidious encouraged the Neimodians to retaliate, having them blockade Naboo in protest.\n\n\u2022 The Naboo Crisis\n\nDarth Maul]]\nAll the pieces were now in place; Palpatine heavily influenced both the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic; Finis Valorum; and the current monarch of Naboo; Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and Sidious had direct control over the timid leaders of the Trade Federation. Everything that transpired did so according to his design.\nThe Blockade of Naboo kick-started uproar in the Senate, but as the Trade Federation had broken no laws, the Judicial department could not act. The Senates stalling weakened Valorums hold on power. However, surprisingly, Palpatine was unable to completely rein in Amidala as he had expected, and she contacted Valorum directly, holding him personally responsible for the crisis.\nValorum panicked, backed into a corner by his own morality and desperate to shore up support, he contacted the Jedi Council. The Council sent Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice; Obi-Wan Kenobi; to Naboo as ambassadors to resolve the issue. The Jedi landed aboard the Trade Federation flagship in orbit above Naboo and waited to meet with Gunray and his aides. Darth Sidious was enraged by this new development, ordering them to proceed with the invasion and have the Jedi killed, as the Neimoidians could simply deny the Jedi's presence. However, Jinn and Kenobi managed to escape the dioxis-flooded conference room. Fighting their way to the bridge entrance, they attempted to force their way in, but were driven off by the Trade Federation Destroyer Droids. The Jedi managed to escape the ship aboard the Trade Federation invasion craft.\nconfronts Qui-Gon Jinn on Tatooine.]]\nWhile the invasion itself proceeded splendidly, the Jedi managed to make contact with Amidala and her entourage, spiriting them off-planet. However, as they escaped, their ship was damaged, and they were forced to detour to Tatooine to make repairs. Sidious was truly alarmed by this, sending Maul to Tatooine to retrieve the Queen, and also to prevent the Jedi from interfering with his potential replacement; Anakin Skywalker. However, despite Maul's efforts, he was unsuccessful, Amidala and the Jedi managed to escape Tatooine, taking Anakin Skywalker with them.\nThe continued existence of the Sith, and their involvement in the crisis, was revealed.\nThe Jedi and the Queen managed to make it to Coruscant, where Amidala met with the Senate, while Anakin Skywalker was taken before the Jedi Council. Palpatine manipulated Amidala into calling for a vote of No-Confidence in Chancellor Valorum, bringing about a Senate election. In accordance with his plan, Palpatine used the blockade of Naboo to take advantage of the sympathy vote, backing up his own popularity. While Palpatine went about his political machinations, the Jedi debated over whether or not to accept the incredibly potent but drastically over-aged Anakin Skywalker for training, a heated issue that added to the tension caused by the revelation of the Sith's continued existence. Ultimately, the issue was stalled when Queen Amidala rashly decided to return to Naboo in an attempt to wrest control back from the Trade Federation. Jinn and Kenobi were sent to accompany her, with Skywalker in tow.\n\n\u2022 The Battle of Naboo\n\nWhen Amidala arrived on Naboo, she used the Gungan exile Jar Jar Binks who had joined her entourage before they fled the planet to make contact with the Gungan leadership. Making amends with the Gungans, whom the humans on Naboo had been tense with for centuries, she convinced them to mobilize their army to attack the Trade Federation droid forces. While the Battle of Naboo commenced, Amidala and the Jedi led a strike team into the Naboo capital to abduct Viceroy Gunray, and dispatch Naboo's air force to attack the Trade Federation flagship in orbit, as it controlled the droid armies that made up the corporations entire force.\nHowever, as the team prepared to exit the hangar after rallying the air force, they were confronted by Darth Maul. As the Jedi broke off to take the Sith Lord, the team took an alternate exit. As this all took place, Anakin Skywalker took refuge in the cockpit of one of the Naboo fighters, accidentally activating the autopilot and going off to join the space battle.\nIt seemed that the Trade Federation and the Sith were going to be victorious in the struggle; Amidala was captured and taken before Gunray, the Gungan forces were routed and captured, the Naboo air force suffered heavy casualties, and Maul managed to kill Qui-Gon Jinn. Obi-Wan Kenobi fell on the Sith Lord in a blind fury, but was ultimately brought down by him, though not killed. However, Amidala managed to gain access to a hidden weapons cache in the throne room, taking Gunray hostage, Anakin Skywalker managed to land within the Trade Federation flagship, destroying the reactor before escaping, and Kenobi managed to get hold of Jinn's lightsaber and use it to defeat Maul with a timely sai tok maneuver, bisecting the Sith lord at the waist.\nUltimately, none of these events proved to be setbacks; Palpatines ultimate goal of gaining the Chancellorship was achieved. Even Mauls apparent death was of little importance; Sidious sent him to Naboo with full knowledge of his eventual fate, thanks to his own precognitive powers. Maul had been a capable apprentice, but he had outlived his usefulness and was ill-suited to the coming tasks.\nUnknown to Sidious and the Jedi, Maul had survived and had been hiding in Lotho Minor for over a decade, succumbing to madness until his brother, Savage Opress, found himBrothers (episode) and brought him home to Dathomir to be cured.Revenge (episode)\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the Trade Federation leaders were taken to Coruscant for trial, though Sidious's manipulations ensured that they never came to a verdict; relations between the Naboo humans and the native Gungans improved considerably, with the two cooperating on numerous projects and public works; and Anakin Skywalker was accepted for Jedi training, his actions in the battle convincing the Jedi Council that he had the Force on his side.\n\n\u2022 Consolidation\n\nSidious was quick to eliminate any evidence of his involvement in the battle. Republic investigators claimed Maul's ship and equipment, but their bungled efforts to examine them resulted in their self-destruction. After the burned out wreck received a more careful examination by Jedi Master Saesee Tiin, he recommended that it be placed in the care of the Jedi Council. However, representatives from Kuat lobbied for the opportunity to study it, and the ship disappeared on its way to a Kuat facility.\nWith these loose ends tied up, Sidious set about laying the foundations for the coming Clone Wars, and enacting several other minor schemes to whittle away the Jedi ranks little by little. Moving into the Chancellor's Suite in the Republic Executive Building, Palpatine redecorated the office to suit his own tastes, hiding many priceless Sith artifacts in plain sight, as many were too obscure to be recognized.\nAlso, Palpatine required a personal detachment of body guards, but he could not be seen actively creating one. So he instead created a situation where they were apparently forced on him. While speaking with his unwitting pawn; Ronhar Kim; he had several members of his Senate Guard detachment attempt to assassinate him. Kim fended them off, and the survivors committed suicide on the spot. However, the damage was done, and the Red Guard was created. At some point, Palpatine sent a group of agents, Voren Kurn, Rorworr, Sia-Lan Wezz, and Deel Surool, to look into the apparent existence of a Sith temple on the world of Puloorn.Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook' When his first term ended, Palpatine ensured that no opposing candidates rose up while keeping his own image spotless. This would be the last election in the history of the Republic, with a constitutional amendment near the end of his second term allowing him to serve indefinitely.\n\n\u2022 The New Apprentice\n\nWhile Darth Maul was ill-suited for the tasks needed, Palpatine still required an apprentice. However, he could not simply train a new one from infancy as he had done with Maul, as neglecting his political career for his Sith duties could prove disastrous, and Anakin Skywalker was not yet a viable option. He examined several potential candidates, such as the Jedi Vergere and Dooku. After Vergere attempted to assassinate him and fled, Palpatine settled on Dooku.\nDooku proved best-suited for what Sidious had in mind. A powerful Jedi master and a highly skilled duelist, Dooku was also known as a maverick and a political activist. Having left the Jedi Order in the wake of the Battle of Naboo, Dooku was also a free agent. Sidious approached him, and after long hours of discussion, convinced the ex-Jedi to join him. As a test of Dookus commitment, Sidious set him after his old friend and colleague from the Jedi, Master Sifo-Dyas. Dyas, anticipating the coming chaos, had contracted the cloners on Kamino to create a clone army. While Sidious planned to seize control of this army, he couldnt allow Dyas to survive. Dooku killed him.Labyrinth of Evil\nDooku was officially brought into the Sith fold, bestowed with the name Darth Tyranus.\n\n\u2022 Instigating The Clone Wars\n\nDarth Tyranus subsequently infiltrated the Jedi Archives and erased several star-systems from the maps, most importantly Kamino, stealing information about several hyperspace lanes in the deep core, as well.\nThe next thing Darth Sidious needed to settle was whose DNA would be used to produce the new clone army. At the same time, another problem had presented itself, for the Bando Gora cult had returned, and Sidious believed they had enough influence to endanger his plans. Sidious ordered Tyranus to deal with these problems, and Dooku obliged, putting a bounty of five million credits over the leader of the cult, Komari Vosa, and leaving the job to the bounty hunter to finish her off. Dooku also planned to ask the successful bounty hunter to be the model for the new clone army, knowing that several powerful mercenaries would seek to achieve the considerable bounty. Jango Fett, a Mandalorian bounty hunter, was able to defeat Komari Vosa at the moon Kohlma and was going to spare her life when Dooku appeared and killed her himself. Dooku then told Jango Fett that he wanted him to be the basis for the clone army.\nAt a later meeting, Dooku tried to make Jango speak more about his past. The bounty hunter, not trusting Dooku because he was once a Jedi, tried to increase his payment by infecting the Sith Lord with a biological weapon. Dooku pretended to be defeated, but convinced Jango to tell the rest of his story. After Fett finished, Dooku healed himself with the force, eliminating Jango's advantage. Jango finally submitted, allowing himself to be cloned on the condition of having an unaltered clone to be his son.\nLater, Dooku supported Kharis Fenn when he tried to take power on planet Ryloth. He did this believing that under Kharis, Ryloth would secede from the Republic when the Clone Wars began. In order to gain leverage, Fenn kidnapped Nat Secura, son of Lon Secura, who was Khariss enemy. A Jedi Master named Tholme attempted to rescue Nat, but was captured himself, and was only spared because Dooku believed he could use Tholme at a later date. Unfortunately for Dooku, two more Jedi arrived, Quinlan Vos and Aayla Secura, and they managed to rescue Nat and stop Kharis Fenn from gaining control of Ryloth. Although Dookus plans failed, the Jedi had absolutely no clue he was involved.\nDooku also assisted the Trade Federation when they tried to eliminate the army that served the Wookiee Trade Guild, since the Guild refused to pay taxes to the Federation. Because no Wookiees survived the battle, Dooku's involvement was unknown to the Jedi.\nDooku and his master continued to plot the war against the Republic, and decided to use the Trade Federation and other corporations in order to make a large enough rift in the galaxy. Darth Sidious decided that the general to be behind the Separatist army should be the Kaleesh warrior Grievous, and sent Dooku to retrieve him.\n\n\u2022 Creating the Confederacy and Stirring the Senate\n\nDooku spoke to San Hill of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, for he knew that Grievous was last hired by them. Together they made a plan to cripple the commander and rebuild him as a cyborg. An ion bomb was planted on Grievous's shuttle, and his seat rigged so that when the bomb went off, the Kaleesh would be ejected.\nAfter the craft crashed, Dooku found a gravely injured Grievous and transported him to Geonosis. There, the Kaleeshan was made into a cyborg that would be perfect for the Clone Wars, with the combined power of his tactical genius.\nThe Sith were very happy with the new Grievous, and only more so after Dooku trained him to be an expert lightsaber duelist. The droid armies now had a general, a position that Dooku did not want for himself.\nDooku then commandeered a communications station and delivered a speech that greatly criticized the Republic. He then asked several systems to secede from the government, and to join his Separatist Movement. Some planets did indeed listen to his speech, and in some cases they built up private armies against the Republic, though it had not yet reached open war.\nBecause of this, Darth Sidious, as Chancellor Palpatine, was allowed to keep his position, which canceled the next election. He then offered to make a fake peaceful meeting with Dooku, but it had been planned beforehand by the Sith. Dooku did not reply, which made the Separatists look like they could not be bargained with.\nPalpatine then tried to make an army for the Republic, and set out to get the Military Creation Act approved. He used a number of debates and even assassinations to show the inadequacy of the Jedi and the need for an army, although he publicly looked as if he had taken no side on the issue.\n\n\u2022 The Clone Wars Begin\n\nAlthough everything was prepared for the Clone Wars, Dooku had run into a few complications. The Fondor Shipyards were critical to the Sith's plans, but three conspirators, Groodo, Rodd, and Hurlo Holowan sought to destroy them. Dooku managed to stop them by once again hiring Jango Fett, and after the trio was brought to him, they agreed to work for the Sith Lord.\nCount Dooku then recruited scientist Jenna Zan Arbor to the Separatist cause, and she became one of the leading scientists for the CIS.\nDooku then tried to bolster the Separatists by trying to make the planet Ansion secede from the Republic, for it was the basis of several minor alliances, including the Malarian Alliance. If Ansion left the Republic, other systems would follow suit. Dooku left this to be done by Commerce Guild Shu Mai, who gave a considerable amount of support to Ansions government, The Unity of Community, making it consider joining the Separatist. The plan failed due to the intervention of Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, as well as their Padawans Anakin Skywalker and Barriss Offee. Dooku later explained to Shu Mai that the secession of Ansion was not necessary to the Confederacys success.\nAlthough Darth Tyranus had gathered a large number of allies around him, he had only a pledge of support from the Trade Federation. Viceroy Gunray demanded the assassination on Senator Amidala as recompense for his defeat at her hands on Naboo before he would commit his droid armies to the Separatist cause. Dooku gave the order to Jango Fett who, in turn, collaborated with former ally Zam Wesell. After failing to kill the Senator upon her arrival on the Republic capital, she tried again by sending a remote droid with two lethally toxic insects to Amidalas apartment. This plan was foiled by the Senators newly appointed Jedi protectors: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. After chasing Wesell across the city, they eventually cornered her in a bar and she lost her arm to Obi-Wans lightsaber. During her interrogation, just as she was about to reveal Jangos involvement, she was killed by a toxic dart fired (unbeknownst to the Jedi) by Fett himself.\nThe Jedi Council then assigned Anakin to escort the Senator home to Naboo - his first solo assignment - whilst Obi-Wan was to discover the nature of the threat to Padm\u00e9's life. Obi-Wan searched through the Jedi archives for information on the toxic dart, but was forced to seek advice from an old acquaintance. This friend identified the weapon as a Kamino saberdart, used by the cloners of the planet Kamino. Obi-Wan returned to the archives and searched for the planet but was unable to find it, earning him a rather harsh rebuke from the archivist when he theorized that the archives were \"incomplete\". Finally seeking insight from Master Yoda, Obi-Wan discovered that the planetary data had been erased from the archives - a cause of great concern to both himself and Yoda.\nTraveling \"to the center of gravity's pull\" as advised by Yoda, Obi-Wan found Kamino exactly where it should have been. After landing, he was escorted to the Prime Minister who proudly displayed the 100,000 strong Clone Army and promised that a million extra troops were almost ready for deployment. After reporting this information back to the Council, Obi-Wan was order to return Fett to them for questioning. While attempting to capture the bounty hunter, he was forced to place a tracking device on the hull of Slave 1.\nJango fled Kamino to Geonosis, where a meeting between Dooku and all of the Separatist leaders was taking place. They were finally forming the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a government that would stand against the Republic. This would be made up an alliance between the Corporate Alliance, Geonosian Industries, the Commerce Guild, the Techno Union, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and the Trade Federation. Obi-Wan had pursued Fett to Geonosis, and witnessed the meeting. He then attempted to contact the Jedi Council, but was captured by the Geonosians, and was imprisoned in a containment field, which kept him totally incapacitated.\nThe Senate had indeed received Obi-Wan's message, but Palpatine planned to use it for his own purposes. He showed the message to the Jedi, who agreed he should be given emergency powers. Representative Jar Jar Binks then volunteered to speak his mind to the senate, and his speech to the many senators was shocking, for they had believed him to be a total buffoon. The majority of the Senate instantly agreed with the Representative, and the power to make a military was finally given to Darth Sidious.\n\n\u2022 Arena Bloodbath\n\nChancellor Palpatine finally enlisted the Clones to be the Grand Army of the Republic. Jedi Master Yoda himself went to retrieve the clones, while a Jedi taskforce was sent to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nAt the same time, Count Dooku decided to interrogate Kenobi himself. Dooku used Drain Knowledge on the captive Jedi, searching for areas for him to be turned to the Dark Side. The Sith Lord attempted to turn Obi-Wan by saying the Republic was corrupt and that Kenobi's old master, Qui-Gon Jinn would have joined him if he was still alive. Kenobi denied him, and said that Dooku was a traitor. Darth Tyranus finally gave up, and left the Jedi in his cell.\nAnakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala arrived in an effort to rescue Obi-Wan, but were then captured themselves. Count Dooku offered the senator freedom if she supported the Separatists, but she refused. The two Jedi and Amidala were then sentenced to death in the arena.\nThe Petranaki arena was packed with Geonosian spectators, and Count Dooku Jango Fett, and other Separatist leaders watched from a high balcony. Three monsters, an acklay, a reek, and a nexu were released to devour the victims.\nFinally, the Jedi Geonosis strike team arrived. Jedi Master Mace Windu confronted Darth Tyranus, but was chased off by Jango, who fought down in the arena.\nDooku was not surprised by the Jedi's ambush, and revealed that the captives he had were just bait for a trap. 10,000 battledroids were waiting for the attack, including a large number of Geonosian warriors. The new Separatist Droid Army quickly overwhelmed the Jedi, and many of them would die while Lord Tyranus watched from the balcony.\n\n\u2022 The Clones Attack\n\nCount Dooku did not join the battle, but Jedi master Coleman Trebor attempted to challenge the Sith Lord. He was unable to actually engage Dooku, for Jango managed to kill the Jedi before a duel commenced. After the Jedi had taken significant losses, Darth Tyranus ordered his droids to cease fire. He then asked Mace Windu to surrender, which was refused.\nSuddenly master Yoda arrived with the Clone Army in tow. The Jedi had taken control of the clones, without knowing that was exactly what Darth Sidious had wanted. The battle droids attacked again, but the reinforcements allowed the Jedi to escape from the arena.\nOutside of the arena, an even larger force of clones was engaging the Separatist army. The Battle of Geonosis was heavily tipped to the side of the Republic, and the Separatists were in full retreat. The Confederacy's leaders regrouped at the Geonosian command center, and decided to abandon the planet. Tyranus pretended he knew nothing of the Clone Army, and Poggle the Lesser ordered his Geonosian warriors to hide underneath the Stalgasin hive, but not before handing the plans to the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station to his master.\nDooku was now free to leave the planet, and retreated to his hangar, where he prepared his solar sailor. He was then attacked by the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, but managed to defeat both of them. Before he was able to kill them or fly away, He was confronted by Yoda.\nAlthough Dooku used both his Force abilities and his dueling skills, he was unable to do more than hold off the Jedi Grandmaster's onslaught. In an attempt to distract Yoda, he tipped a massive column with the force, which fell towards Kenobi and Skywalker, who were still unable to move. Yoda broke off the battle to save the two, allowing the Sith Lord to escape in his Solar Sailor.\nDarth Tyranus then arrived on Coruscant, where he met with Darth Sidious himself at the Works. Dooku informed Palpatine that the Clone Wars had begun, and gave his master the Death Star plans to the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station.\n\n\u2022 Early Conflicts in the Clone Wars\n\nII\nAfter reporting to his master, Dooku traveled to his secret base on Bakura, hoping to regroup the Separatist forces. Unfortunately for him, this move was expected by Jedi Tholme and Sora Bulq. The pair confronted Dooku, hoping to defeat the Sith still tired from the attack on Geonosis.\nThe trio began a vicious duel, in which Dooku used force lightning to defeat Bulq. He then attempted to bring Tholme over to the dark side, but the Jedi refused. Dooku brought down the roof on Tholme, presuming him dead. The Sith Lord then left with the unconscious body of Sora.\nDooku healed Bulq and persuaded him to turn to the Dark side of the force, becoming one of the first Dark Acolytes. Sora returned to Tholme and rescued him from the rubble. Both of them returned to Coruscant, allowing the Sith to have a spy within the Jedi order.\nBecause of the Clone Wars, Palpatine was able to consolidate his power as Chancellor. Several amendments were made to the constitution that handed more power to Palpatine, including Statute 312b, which gave more weight to votes cast by Core and Inner Rim worlds, who were more dependable on supporting the Chancellor than those of Rim Worlds.\nDooku had also begun the excavation of the Force Harvester on Raxus Prime, so he could recreate the Sith weapon the Dark Reaper. While on Raxus Prime, Dooku put a live bounty on Jango Fett's son Boba, who had escaped during the Battle of Geonosis. The bounty hunter Aurra Sing captured Fett and brought him to Dooku, who held him on Raxus Prime so that the Sith lord could find out how much Boba knew about his Sith identity.\nFett ignored Dookus instructions and instead investigated the excavation. Dooku became irritated at Bobas actions, and ordered the boy to be killed. But due to a sudden Jedi attack on Raxus Prime, Dooku left his new bodyguard Cydon Prax to kill Fett. Boba evaded Dooku's enforcers and escaped.\nDuring the Conquest of Raxus Prime, Dooku and Cydon Prax found the Force Harvester just as a Clone Army, led by Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, arrived to attack the Separatists. As the Clones overwhelmed the Separatists, Dooku and Prax boarded a cruiser with the Harvester on board, but Skywalker spotted them and boarded the cruiser. Dooku and Skywalker dueled in the cargo bay of the cruiser, but Prax ended it by shooting Skywalker with a tranquilizer dart.\nDooku imprisoned Anakin on Alaris Prime, one of Kashyyyks moons. Dooku was going to test the harvester there, but Skywalker escaped and freed the Wookiees, causing the Battle of Alaris Prime. Dooku fled the moon, taking the harvester with him. The Sith lord used the harvester to drain the life-force from inhabitants of Agamar, Bakura and Mon Calamari before retreating to Thule to prepare the rest of the Dark Reaper for use.\n\n\u2022 Battle of Thule\n\nThe Jedi attacked Thule to destroy the Dark Reaper, which Dooku soon tried using on the Republic forces. But Skywalker broke through the Separatist lines to reach the weapon, killing Prax in the process. Skywalker had learned from a hologram of Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma of how to resist the effects of the Dark Reaper, so he was able to destroy the weapon and its harvester. Dooku fled, and later made a public statement that Raxus Prime and other worlds were only temporary bases, while the important Separatist planets were secure.\nDooku later ordered his Dark Acolyte Sevrance Tann to capture the Republic world Sarapin. She did, but the Republic soon took it back during the Battle of Krant, killing Tann.\nTwo months after the Battle of Geonosis, Dooku traveled to The Cauldron, a gladiatorial arena on Rattatak. He was greeted by his host and taken to watch the contest. He soon realized that Asajj Ventress, a Dathomirian warlord, had assassinated Dooku's guide, seeking to impress the Sith. Dooku complimented her skills, but told the warlord that he was not looking for a spy.\nVentress then jumped into the arena, killing all of the gladiators. Dooku congratulated her, but then Ventress claimed that she was a Sith. Dooku refuted that statement, and Asajj attacked him in anger. The Sith Lord easily incapacitated her with force lightning before she could reach him.\nDooku brought the unconscious Ventress to a room on Rattatak, and attacked her when she woke up. They dueled, and Ventress was so skilled that she proved difficult for Dooku to defeat, but he managed to disarm her and destroy her lightsabers. But Dooku did not kill Asajj, and instead introduced her to his master, Darth Sidious, who sent her on a mission to find and kill Anakin Skywalker.\nTyranus believed that Ventress would defeat Skywalker, but Sidious said that the outcome did not matter. Ventress did not succeed in killing Skywalker, but she continued to serve Dooku as a dark acolyte and commander.\n\n\u2022 The First Battle of Kamino\n\nThe two Sith lords soon developed a plan that would leave the Confederacy and the Republic locked in conflict. Commander Merai, a Mon Calamari and one of the Confederacys best tacticians, planned the First Battle of Kamino to wipe out the Republics cloning facilities. The Jedi Knight Aayla Secura discovered the planned attack, and warned the Republic, but when Dooku's agent Tookarti warned the Sith, Dooku said it did not matter.\nThe battle went exactly as planned. The Republic ambushed the Confederacys ships, and Merai was killed while his fleet routed. Dooku regretted Merais death, but Sidious was pleased with how the battle had ended any quick ending to the war. Losses on both sides maintained the balance between the Republic and CIS.\nDooku was prevented by the Rule of Two from having a Sith apprentice, but he still made his own group of Dark Acolytes. These included Asajj Ventress and Sora Bulq, and then Tol Skorr, Kadrian Sey, Trenox and Saato. He did train them, but taught them little of Sith teachings.\nDooku also enlisted the GenDai mercenary Durge to aide the Separatists, and used Sora Bulq to create strife in the Jedi Order. Bulq tried to convince some Jedi to join the Confederacy, but this was foiled by Mace Windu, who revealed Sora as a traitor.\n\n\u2022 Sidious' triumph\n\nIn 20 BBY, Darth Maul returned to the Known Galaxy, having survived his injuries on Naboo. He took his brother, Savage Opress, as an apprentice, and together they attempted to conquer Mandalore with the aid of the Death Watch. They came to the attention of Darth Sidious, who murdered Opress and imprisoned Maul for his own ends.\nIn 19 BBY, with the Clone Wars approaching their conclusion and the Separatists besieged in the Outer Rim Territories, Darth Sidious was ready to make his final move. At the Battle of Coruscant, he betrayed Tyranus and goaded Anakin Skywalker into killing him, driving Anakin closer to the dark side. Separated from his master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin leaned heavily on the advice of Sidious' persona of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and was slowly convinced that turning to the dark side of the Force was the only way he could save his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, from death in childbirth. Proclaimed Darth Vader by Sidious, Anakin became his new apprentice, murdering much of the Jedi on Coruscant before assassinating the Separatist Council on Mustafar, ending the Clone Wars. Capitalizing on the threat of a \"Jedi rebellion\" and his emergency powers as Supreme Chancellor, Sidious dissolved the Republic and proclaimed a Galactic Empire, and was acclaimed as Emperor by the Galactic Senate. The Sith ruled the galaxy once more, from the Core Worlds to Wild Space.\nFrom 19 to 1 BBY, Darth Sidious eradicated most of the Jedi in the Great Jedi Purge, driving the few survivors, like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, into hiding. The galaxy was Imperialized and the Galactic Empire conducted numerous atrocities to solidify its rule. It was not until 2 BBY that an alliance of rebels and dissidents emerged to challenge the Galactic Empire, beginning the Galactic Civil War. In 0 BBY, on Tatooine, Obi-Wan Kenobi successfully convinced Darth Vaders son Luke Skywalker, whom Vader had thought dead with his wife, to train as a Jedi Knight and help overthrow the Empire. Luke was responsible for the destruction of the Death Star battle station at the Battle of Yavin, dealing a stunning blow to the Empire but bringing the survival of Anakin Skywalkers children to the Sith's attention.IVV\n\n\u2022 The end of the Banite Sith\n\nSidious plotted to turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side and replace Vader. Having learned of his parentage, Luke was determined to turn his father back to the light side of the Force. Allowing himself to be taken prisoner, Luke was brought before Sidious aboard the Empires Second Death Star, where he engaged Vader in a ferocious duel while imploring him to turn back the light side. Enraged by Lukes refusal to turn to the dark side, Sidious attempted to murder him with Force lightning, but the sight of his son being tortured to death was enough to convince Vader to turn against his Sith master. Anakin Skywalker hurled Sidious down the Death Stars reactor shaft but suffered mortal injuries in the process. At the same time, the Alliance to Restore the Republic attacked and destroyed the Second Death Star at the Battle of Endor, dealing to the Galactic Empire a blow from which it would never recover. Luke escaped the Death Star with his fathers body. Anakin's death and redemption and the death of Darth Sidious marked the presumed extinction of the Sith Order, thus fulfilling the Ancient Jedi Prophecy of the Chosen One.VI\nWith its Emperor gone, Sidious empire collapsed into warlordism and the Alliance proclaimed a New Republic. Sidious spirit survived, however, and it made an agonizing journey to the Imperial redoubt of Byss in the Deep Core. Reborn in a cloned body, Sidious attempted to restore the Galactic Empire in 10 ABY with a massive military campaign launched out of the Deep Core. Sidious planned to establish a \"Dark Empire,\" an avowedly-Sith magocracy governed and run by the Force influence of his Dark Side Elite. However, Sidious clone bodies were poisoned by Carnor Jax, who hoped to proclaim himself Emperor in Sidious place, and the dying Sith Lord desperately sought a healthy new vessel for his spirit. At the Battle of Onderon in 11 ABY, Sidious attempted to possess the infant Anakin Solo. However, he was shot in the back by Han Solo and his spirit was dragged into the Netherworld of the Force by the mortally-wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand, ensuring that he could never be resurrected and destroying what little remained of Darth Banes Sith.Star Wars: Dark Empire'\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\nLumiya\n\u2022 14 ABY&ndash;A Sith cult, the Disciples of Ragnos, attempt to resurrect Marka Ragnos, but are thwarted through the efforts of the New Jedi Order.Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy\n\n\u2022 40 ABY&ndash;Lumiya appears in the galaxy again, and seduces Jacen Solo to join her.

No single entity long survived the vigilance of the Jedi Knights, but even in defeat the ancient Sith teachings proved difficult to suppress. Each time the Jedi Order grew complacent, a Sith cult, brotherhood, order, or empire would arise from the ashes to threaten the galaxy once more. New iterations of the Sith would be linked only tenuously to past traditions through a shared ideology.\nSith (species)\nThe Sith were a species of red-skinned humanoids native to Ziost and Korriban who were conquered by exiled Dark Jedi. Prior to their discovery, the Sith were divided into a meek and lowly slave class, a skilled and intelligent engineer class, the warlike Massassi class, and a priest class. Over time, the Sith interbred with the Human Dark Jedi through the practice of Sith alchemy, and the two peoples became one.\nMassassi\nThe Massassi were a Sith subspecies. They were distinguished by their abnormally giant size. They would serve as soldiers for the Sith Empire.Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide\nSith Empire\n]]\nThe Sith Empire was a rich and powerful empire that was established by Dark Jedi banished from the Galactic Republic after their defeat at the Battle of Corbos at the end of the Hundred-Year Darkness. After developing in complete isolation for 1900 years, the Sith eventually rediscovered the Republic. The Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow led the Empire in an invasion during the Great Hyperspace War, but he was defeated. The Sith Empire was believed to have been utterly destroyed by Republic forces in the aftermath of the second battle of Korriban. However, one Dark Lord escaped to the Unknown Regions with a group of survivors and rebuilt the Empire. Using dark secrets, he managed to survive for many centuries and eventually attacked the Republic. After a Great Galactic War that lasted for many decades, the Sith and the Republic signed a treaty and from that moment existed as two separate governments.\nLost Tribe of Sith\nIn 5000 BBY, a Sith starship, the Omen, crashed-landed on the planet of Kesh. The survivors of the crash eventually formed the Lost Tribe. Over thousands of years, this Lost Tribe had multiplied into a substantial force, and shortly after the Second Galactic Civil War they were ready to fulfill their destiny, and take on a weakened galaxy.\nBrotherhood of the Sith\nThe Brotherhood of the Sith was a group of Dark Jedi founded by Exar Kun who broke away from the Jedi Order to study Sith techniques. During the Great Sith War, the Brotherhood attempted to conquer the Republic with the aid of the Krath and the Mandalorian Crusaders. The Brotherhood was defeated and virtually exterminated during the Battle of Yavin 4.\nKrath\nThe Krath was a Sith secret society founded by Aleema and Satal Keto, the bored heirs to the Empress Teta system. Following a Krath attack on a Jedi conclave, Ulic Qel-Droma attempted to infiltrate the group, but he failed. He was seduced to the dark side and eventually became the leader of the sect. During the Great Sith War, the Krath became the military arm of Exar Kun's Sith Order and fell with it on Yavin 4.\nDarth Revan's Sith Empire\nKreia\nThe Sith Empire was temporarily resurrected by the fallen Jedi Revan and Malak. Built upon a hardened core of veterans from the Mandalorian Wars and a host of Jedi converts, the fledgling new galactic power very nearly succeeded in conquering the Republic during the Jedi Civil War. After the redemption of Darth Revan and the death of Darth Malak, their Empire splintered into factions and eventually collapsed.\nSith Triumvirate\nThe Sith Triumvirate was a brief but deadly Sith Order founded by the former Jedi Kreia, now known as Darth Traya, she took two apprentices of unknown origins and trained many new Sith at the Trayus Academy on Malachor V. After her exile from the Triumvirate the two remaining Sith Lords; Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion executed the First Jedi Purge. The Sith Triumvirate was a loose alliance of what remained of Darth Revan's Sith Empire. It was solidified sometime after the Battle of Rakata Prime. This organization comprised several, if not hundreds of Sith apprentices, Sith Masters and most importantly, Sith Assassins. The members were eventually defeated by Meetra Surik.\nNew Sith Empire\nThe New Sith Empire was founded by Darth Ruin, and was the vast area of galactic territory formed out of the Fourth Great Schism, which the Sith ruled over with an iron fist. Its capital was the planet Roon. At its height during the New Sith Wars, it was almost as good as the old Sith Empires of Naga Sadow and Darth Revan; following the Battle of Mizra and during the Republic Dark Age, it encompassed a great percentage of the known Galaxy.\nSometime between 1010 and 1006 BBY the New Sith Empire collapsed in a civil war. From the ashes, Skere Kaan established the Brotherhood of Darkness.\nBrotherhood of Darkness\nFounded by Lord Kaan, the Brotherhood of Darkness (sometimes referred to as the Dark Army) was the last mass gathering of the Sith for nearly 1200 years. An army of over twenty thousand Sith Lords and their followers, its destruction on Ruusan heralded the beginning of a new order.\nOrder of the Sith Lords\nUnder the last surviving Sith Lord of that army, Darth Bane, a new Sith Order was created as a result of the devastating Seventh Battle of Ruusan, which saw the annihilation of the previous Sith Order. Banes Sith Order, known formally as the Order of the Sith Lords, was founded upon the principles of Darth Revans Holocron, where from he formed the Rule of Two, utilizing stealth tactics and treachery to achieve their means. The Rule of Two would allow his eventual successor, Darth Sidious, to finally triumph over the Jedi and the Galactic Republic nearly 1,000 years later.\nDisciples of Ragnos\nThe Disciples of Ragnos was a Sith Cult under the leadership of Tavion Axmis, who sought to resurrect the spirit of Marka Ragnos through ancient Sith sorcery and take control of the galaxy. The cult was closely related to the Empire Reborn movement of which Tavion had herself been part with the Dark Jedi Desann. The cult was ultimately defeated by Jaden Korr and the New Jedi Order.\nLumiya's Sith\nLumiyas Sith were a loosely collected group of individuals associated with Lumiya, self-proclaimed Dark Lady of the Sith after the final death of Darth Sidious. Even with Palpatines final death, the Sith continued to survive. Their next Sith Lord was an Emperors Hand named Lumiya. Darth Vader had passed on to Lumiya some Sith teaching secretly from his master, and the woman adopted the title \"Dark Lady of the Sith\" upon her masters death at Endor. She trained two apprentices: Flint, who was redeemed by Vaders son Luke Skywalker, and Carnor Jax, who was killed by Palpatine loyalist Kir Kanos.\nSoon afterwards she succeeded in convincing Vaders grandson Jacen Solo to join the ranks of the Sith, thus calling himself Darth Caedus. Darth Caedus later corrupted the Jedi Tahiri Veila and took her as his apprentice. However, following the death of Caedus and the redemption of his apprentice, the war Lumiya had started was over; and Lumiyas Sith had perished.\nOne Sith\nBy the year 130 ABY, a new Sith Order had risen to take the place of Darth Bane's order. A Sith known as Darth Krayt began the order on Korriban, the ancient Sith burial world, around\n30 ABY after studying the teachings of XoXaan. In this new Sith cult, many of the followers sported a red-and-black tattooed appearance and used lightsabers with an yorik coral-styled hilt design. This Sith Order was considered heretical by some Sith of the past such as Darth Bane, who disapproved of the training of larger numbers of Sith. Krayt spent over a century growing and strengthening the new order, planning to unify the galaxy once more under Sith rule. He and his new order made their presence known around 127-130 ABY by initiating the Sith\u2013Imperial War, and then launching an attack on the Jedi on Ossus. In 138 ABY Darth Krayt fell and Darth Nihl claimed control of the Order, sending the One Sith into hiding. The One Sith, however, would apparently end up mostly wiped out by Darth Wredd, a believer in the Rule of Two and aided by the Fel Empire. .\n\n\u2022 Ranks\n\nThe Sith had a clearly defined hierarchy which divided the strong from the weak, but because the Sith order existed in numerous disparate incarnations, the Sith hierarchy did not maintain a single continuous ranking system throughout its history. The Sith hierarchy remained much the same for almost 6,000 years - through the ancient Sith Empire, Exar Kuns Brotherhood of the Sith, and Darth Revans Sith Empire - until Lord Kaan declared that all of his highest ranking followers in the Brotherhood of Darkness were Dark Lords of the Sith. Like the Jedi and the Old Republic, the Sith underwent a great reformation after the apocalyptic final Battle of Ruusan. The Sith order's destruction inspired Darth Bane to reform the order and decree that there would be only two Sith at a time from that point forward: a Master and an apprentice. Both would bear the title \"Dark Lord of the Sith,\" which would become synonymous with the term \"Sith Lord.\"\n\n\u2022 Sith Empire\n\nThese were the ranks of the Sith Order before Darth Bane instituted the Rule of Two.\nDark Lord of the Sith\nDark Lords of the Sith were the greatest and most powerful of the Sith Lords. Up until the reign of Kaan, it was a title that was only given to those that were acknowledged as the leaders of their order, but by the end of the New Sith Wars the title was held by many Sith Lords simultaneously.\nSith Lord\nSith Lords were the leaders of the Sith. They commanded armies of Sith Minions, Acolytes and Warriors during wartime and ruled through a governing body known as the Sith Council. Sith Lords used the dark side of the Force to inflict misery, suffering, and corruption. They were also tasked with preserving the lore of the Sith by passing all their knowledge on to their acolytes. While they did not enter combat as often as lesser Sith (preferring to use pawns, servants, or proxies), they were the most fearsome of the Sith as they were the keepers of the Sith's greatest secrets and wielders of its most potent sorceries.\nSith Marauder\nSith Marauders, a variant of the Sith Warriors, were often responsible for the most brutal acts carried out by the Sith. Their training emphasized the aggressive use of a lightsaber rather than the Force. A Sith Marauder's berserk physical prowess was a dark side technique fueled by hatred, rage, and cruelty. Thus, most Marauders could duel an average Jedi toe-to-toe and win easily. Caring little for the subtleties of manipulating others and lacking a deep understanding of the Force, Marauders were often burdened with carrying out the wishes of the Sith Lords.\nSith Warrior\nSith Warrior was a rank of the Sith order before Darth Bane's reform of the Sith Order. They were mid-ranking Sith who generally focused their energies and skills towards battle, spending little time on actual dark side philosophy or other concerns of the \"purer\" Sith.\nSith Acolyte\nSith Acolyte were Force-sensitive apprentices who had only just started down the dark path under the tutelage of a more experienced Sith.\nSith adept\nSith Adept was a Sith rank during the New Sith Wars, similar to Sith acolyte. The Brotherhood of Darkness trained them in the Dathomir Academy and Iridonia Academy.\nSith assassin\n]]\nSpecialized Sith minions included Sith assassins, who preferred to ambush targets from the shadows rather than engaging them in standard combat. Almost always working solo or in small groups, they utilized stealth field generators and the rare art of Force camouflage to launch surprise attacks on their Jedi victims. While some used a lightsaber, most fought with more conventional melee weapons such as force pikes. Darth Traya, Darth Sion, and Darth Nihilus commanded legions of Sith Assassins during the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War, causing the near-extermination of the Jedi Order. The Sith Assassins drew their powers from the Force power of their enemies.\nSith Minion\nSith Minions were the lowliest members of the Sith. Some were not even Force-sensitive, and often worshiped the Sith Lords as gods. Sith Cultists, Sith assassins and Sith Marauders can be considered examples of Sith Minions. However, the Sith also used soldiers, mercenaries, and conscripts to work for them.\n\n\u2022 Post-Bane\n\nDark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader\nand Darth Vader.]]\nTo ensure the continued survival of the Sith, Bane was forced to put them on the brink of extinction. He instituted the Rule of Two. In Bane's order, both Sith held the title Dark Lord of the Sith. The rule of the two instituted that a master train an apprentice. Once the apprentice was fully trained, he would kill the master and take on the mantle himself and repeat the process. The death of the master is either a ceremonial killing or an assassination.\nSith Master\nSith Masters were Sith Lords that had an apprentice serving beneath them. Other than Bane, notable Sith Masters include Darth Zannah, Darth Cognus, Darth Plagueis and his successor; Darth Sidious.\nSith apprentice\nSith apprentices were Sith neophytes that were studying under the tutelage of a Sith Master. Notable Sith apprentices include Darth Millennial, Darth Maul, Darth Tyranus and Darth Vader.\nDark Side Adepts\nDark Side Adepts were not technically Sith. These Force-sensitives were chosen and honed by the Sith apprentice. Essentially, adepts were candidates to replace Apprentices when they were killed or ascended to mastery. Notables included Darth Tyranuss Dark Acolytes, whose numbers included Sora Bulq and the infamous Asajj Ventress, and Darth Vaders secret apprentice Galen Marek.\n\n\u2022 Palpatine Era\n\nDarth Vader]]\nDarth Sidious and Darth Vader.]]\nWhen Palpatine declared himself Galactic Emperor, the Sith controlled the known galaxy, in a political sense, for the first time. With this new, far-reaching authority came a need for functionaries throughout the Empire who were, to one extent or another, supporters if not adherents of the dark side. Though not Sith in any strict sense, these quasi-Sith minions were known generally as Dark Side Adepts. As Force-sensitive individuals serving the Emperor, they supported his Sith rule by working in the roles of servants, agents, intelligence operatives, military officials, etc. Dark Side Adepts were particularly important when Palpatine was reborn into his clone bodies, six years after his death.\nInquisitorius\nThe Inquisitorius was a secret division of Imperial Intelligence consisting of dark side Force-sensitive agents known as Inquisitors (sometimes also as Inquisitioners), or \"truth officers\".\nUnder the control of Darth Vader, these Inquisitors were considered the highest ranking of the Dark Side Adepts, outranking the Emperor's Hands, Prophets of the Dark Side, and lesser Dark Jedi. They reported directly to Emperor Palpatine.\nProphets of the Dark Side\n]]\nThe Dark Side Prophets were an ancient Outer Rim renegade Sith order founded by Darth Millennial. Darth Sidious rediscovered the group and brought them once again under his control, renaming them the Emperor's Mages.\nEmperor's Hands\nEmperors Hands were top-secret special operatives trained in the Force by the Emperor himself. They were so secret they usually had no knowledge of each other. Mara Jade was one of the best-known Emperors Hands.\nTogether with the Emperors Mages, the Emperors Hands were called the Dark Side Elite.\nEmperor's Royal Guard\nThese were hand-picked elite stormtroopers assigned to protect and serve the Emperor directly. Force sensitivity was by no means a requirement. Those with advanced talents, however, were assigned as Sovereign Protectors, and those with even more advanced talents underwent Force training under Dark Jedi tutors. The Shadow Guards also possessed dark side training.\nDark Jedi\nAlthough the name might imply otherwise, Dark Jedi were not synonymous with Sith, although Darth Vader among others used techniques drawn from the traditions of both the Dark Jedi and the Sith. Dark Jedi were distinguished from the Sith in the fact that Dark Jedi just used the dark side, whereas the Sith abided by the religion and codes passed down through the holocrons. It was much more likely for Dark Jedi to return to the Light (e.g. Kam Solusar). Other notable Dark Jedi included Joruus C'baoth and Jerec.\n\n\u2022 Legacy Era\n\n\u2022 Lost Tribe of Sith\n\n, Sith apprentice of the Lost Tribe]]\nIn 5000 BBY, the Sith warship Omen who had a human crew, member of the Sith Empire, crash landed on Kesh. Spurred on by the ship's captain, Yaru Korsin, the Sith conquered the Keshiri indigenous population and became the undisputed rulers of the uncharted planet. But, the planet isolated and devoided of the materials needed to repair the ship, imprisoned these Sith for nearly five thousand years. Forgotten by the rest of the galaxy and by the Jedi Order, the Lost Tribe members developed their society, growing in number and deepening their knowledge over the dark side.\nAnd when a Sith Meditation Sphere seeking for new masters to serve, arrived on their adoptive homeworld in 41 ABY, they were ready to conquer the galaxy.\nVery many and very organized the Lost Tribe of Sith was a hierarchical society based on merit, not birth, which allowed all Force-sensitive inhabitants of Kesh, Human or Keshiri, climbing the rungs of the prevailing order of the Sith. This order included seven ranks, ranging from apprentice without master to the Supreme Head of the Order: Sith Tyro, Sith apprentice, Sith Saber, Sith Master, Sith Lord, High Lord and Grand Lord.\nGrand Lord\nGrand Lord was the title of the ruler of the Circle of Lords, the ruling council of the Lost Tribe of Sith in the capital city of Tahv on the planet Kesh. The first Grand Lord was Yaru Korsin, who was appointed to the position in 5000 BBY by Izri Dazh. As of 43 ABY the Grand Lord was Darish Vol.\nHigh Lord\nA High Lord was a presiding member on the Circle of Lords. There were seven High Lords on the Circle; they ranked above the thirteen Lords that sat on the Circle, but below the Grand Lord.\nSith Saber\nA Sith apprentice was promoted to the rank of Sith Saber after they had completed their formal training under a Master, making the rank equivalent to that of a Jedi Knight. When a member of the Tribe obtained the rank of Saber, they were allowed to customize their robes and acquire possessions.\nSith Tyro\nA Sith Tyro was an apprentice of the Lost Tribe, who had not yet been chosen to become a formal Sith apprentice. It can be considered roughly equivalent to the Jedi rank of Initiate.\n\n\u2022 One Sith\n\nSith with their leader, Darth Krayt (armored)]]\nBy the year 130 ABY a new Sith Order had risen to take the place of that of Darth Banes order. Krayt abolished Darth Banes Rule of Two. Instead, there would be the Rule of One&mdash;that One being the Sith Order itself as directed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, under which there would be many Sith who serve.\nRuled by Krayt, the new Sith Order flourished and a chance for Galactic domination presented itself. The reverse Vong-forming of worlds was sabotaged and when the galaxy at large blamed and persecuted the Yuuzhan Vong, the GA and Jedi Order were split down the middle. In the midst of the New Galactic Civil War the Fel Empire joined forces with the Legacy Sith and brought the galaxy to its knees. The new Sith, however, betrayed the Empire and deposed the Emperor. Darth Krayt assumed the throne of the Empire. But the deposed Emperor, Roan Fel, set up a rival faction of the Empire that remained loyal to him. Each side tried to dominate the Galaxy in the years to come.\nIt is known that a Sith known as Darth Krayt began the order on Korriban, the ancient Sith burial world, around 30 ABY. In this new Sith cult, many of the followers sported a red and black tattooed appearance.\nFist\nThe Fist was a Sith Lord who served as the supreme military commander for the new Sith Order. The Fist was appointed to the position by Darth Krayt. As of 137 ABY Darth Stryfe served as Krayts Fist. At the Massacre at Ossus, Darth Nihl was the Fist, but was made a Hand when his predecessor was killed during the battle.\nHands\nThe Hands were Darth Krayt's most able servants, trained and existing to carry out his will. They took only his orders, and reported only to him.\nBy 137 ABY, Krayt's only Hand was Darth Nihl, having been given the post when his predecessor died unexpectedly. That year, he made Darth Talon into his second Hand, a fact that displeased Nihl.\nSith Intelligence and Assassination\nSith Intelligence and Assassination was an agency of the new Sith Order of Darth Krayt. It was in charge of spying, political murder, and torture. Around 130 ABY, it was headed by Darth Maladi. Jor Torlin was one of its ranking agents.\nDarth Maladi's laboratory, in the Temple of the Sith, was a location of Sith Intelligence and Assassination.\nVoice\nThe Sith Lord who held the ranks of Voice was the second in command of the One Sith, serving as advisor to the Dark Lord of the Sith and as his caretaker and mouthpiece during Lord Krayt's periods in stasis. This title was held by the line of Chagrian Sith Lords known as Darth Wyyrlok. By the time of the Second Imperial Civil War, there had been three Darth Wyyrloks, while the fourth in line, Saarai underwent Sith training in Korriban.\nAfter the disappearance of Darth Krayt's body, Darth Wyyrlok promoted Darth Nihl as the new Voice so as to keep his loyalty after his self-proclamation as Emperor.\nLoremaster\nThe Loremaster was a Sith Lord who kept the number of Sith artifacts and records attained by the Order. The third Darth Wyyrlok also held this position, and was an expert in the history of the Sith and the Order's many incarnations throughout the millennia.\nInquisitor\nInquisitors were Sith Lords responsible for extracting information of enemy prisoners. They employed a number of techniques, ranging from imprisonment and interrogation to torture. Darth Havok was an Inquisitor within the order.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nGeorge Lucas on the Sith\nThe Sith first appeared as the primary antagonists of George Lucas Original trilogy and the Prequel trilogy. The word Sith itself was first used in the 1976 novelization of Star Wars as a title for the key villain Darth Vader, the \"Dark Lord of the Sith,\" a term cut from the original film. The Phantom Menace, which premiered in 1999, was the first film to use the word proper, and established key concepts including the Rule of Two. In addition, the origins and history of the Sith was explored by several Star Wars Legends works including the 1991 Dark Horse Comics Star Wars: Dark Empire story arc, the mid-1990s Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comics, the 2003 BioWare game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and its sequels, Drew Karpyshyns Darth Bane Trilogy, the futuristic Star Wars: Legacy comic series, and John Jackson Millers Lost Tribe of the Sith novellas. More recently, the canon television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels' have touched upon the origins and history of the Sith.\nAs first documented in the 1997 book Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays by Laurent Bouzereau, the antagonists of the story referred as \"Legions of Lettow\" in Lucass 1974 first script draft for the 1977 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. The faction would ultimately morph into the Sith.Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays'\nAside from the Star Wars franchise, the word \"Sith\" first appeared in the American science fantasy novel The Warlord of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs in reference to a wasp-like creature the size of a bull.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nLegacy (2006) 21]]\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 Trooper (comic story)\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Han Solo Affair\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\u2022 Death Star Designer\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Visions of the Blade\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 film\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 game\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: Bombad Bounty\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: Darth Maul's Mission\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Phantom Menace DK Reader\n\n\u2022 Jedi Academy: Return of the Padawan\n\n\u2022 Battle of the Sith Lords Canceled\n\n\u2022 Shadow of the Sith Canceled\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Episode VII: Shadows of the Sith Canceled\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Lords of Nal Hutta\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Strongholds of Resistance\n\n\u2022 Keeping the Peace\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Sith\n\n\u2022 Chris Anderson]]",

Born on Corellia, he was orphaned at an early age and taken by the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Garris Shrike]] to serve on his crew. He was treated cruelly, and served Shrike for many years before escaping while in his teens. Solo became a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], and fell in love with [[Bria Tharen]], though she left him due to her duties to the Rebel Alliance. Solo then entered the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]] at [[Carida/Legends|Carida]], serving with distinction. He was kicked out, however, when he stopped an Imperial officer from beating a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] named [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] with a [[Neuronic whip/Legends|neuronic whip]] for resisting capture. In gratitude, the Wookiee swore a life debt to Solo, protecting him with his life and a bond of friendship formed between the two that was unbreakable. Solo became a smuggler once again, with Chewbacca at his side. Piloting the upgraded and customized [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], which he won in a game of [[Sabacc/Legends|Sabacc]] against [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], his future ally, he became known as one of the best smugglers in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].\n\nOn the run from Imperial officials, Solo became caught up with the Rebel Alliance, courtesy of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and [[Princess/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo/Legends|Leia Organa]], whom he helped rescue from the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]]. Solo helped Skywalker destroy the Death Star when it attacked the Rebel base at [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], where they had taken Organa. Solo became an unofficial member of the Rebel Alliance, and fell in love with Organa. He officially joined the Alliance in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]] and was immediately commissioned as a [[General/Legends|general]]. He led the [[Endor strike team/Legends|strike team]] that helped destroy the [[Death Star II/Legends|Second Death Star]] at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], in which [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] was killed. A year later, the New Republic was founded.\n\nSolo [[Wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa/Legends|married]] Organa in [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], and the two had three children: [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]], [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]], and [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]]. As the New Republic was threatened by many enemies in its first years of existence, Solo was always on the move, sometimes traveling with Skywalker, who was Organa's brother. Along with his wife and faithful Wookiee friend, Solo fought against [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Zsinj]], [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], the reborn Emperor Palpatine, [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Natasi Daala|Daala]] and the [[Yevetha]]. In [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]] the New Republic was attacked by the [[Yuuzhan Vong]]. The [[Yuuzhan Vong War|war]] that followed lasted four years and was extremely bloody. Solo's closest friend Chewbacca and his son Anakin Solo both died during the war, deaths that haunted the ex-smuggler. The Vong were eventually defeated and the New Republic was reformed into the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]]. In [[40 ABY]], his son Jacen turned to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and took control of the Galactic Alliance. Solo and his wife joined the [[Confederation|rebel faction]] opposing Darth Caedus, and the two were prepared to kill him, as they no longer saw him as their son. At the end of the war, Solo was still having tense relations with the GA government.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n====Childhood====\n{{Quote|Oh, Han's no mystery man. What you see is absolutely what you get. His ''past'' is a mystery, yes. He's never said much and I doubt he ever will.|Leia Organa Solo|<ref name=\"AAC\">''[[Ambush at Corellia]]''</ref>}}\nThere were many rumors and speculation as to what happened to Han Solo in his earlier years. He was the subject of several holofilms, documentaries and at least two supposed \"autobiographies\" whose true authorship was questionable. For example, one contested account said that Solo was raised by [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] from age seven to twelve after his parents left him.\n\n[[File:Han_bullied.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Han is bullied by a group of [[Youngling/Legends|kids]].]]\nIn reality, Han Solo was orphaned at an early age, and his earliest memories were of being found in a Corellian [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] by [[Garris Shrike]] with no clear memory of his life beforehand. Shrike took Solo in as a member of his band of vagabonds, training and using him in his underhanded enterprises. First, Han was sent out as a beggar, using his young appearance to get handouts. When he was older, Han learned how to pickpocket by first practicing on a [[F8GN|droid]] of Shrike's, and then being sent out into the streets. During this time, Solo was befriended by [[Dewlannamapia|Dewlanna]], a Wookiee who was serving as a cook aboard [[Liberator (Liberator-class)|''Trader's Luck'']], Shrike's [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. \n\nDewlanna raised Solo as her own son, teaching him [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]] and taking care of him when he became ill. Han would go on to participate in numerous scams and illegal activities under Shrike's direction, including participating in an [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] [[Mining/Legends|mining]] scam and [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop racing]].<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\">''[[The Paradise Snare]]''</ref>\n\nThough Solo wanted to learn more about his family, especially his parents, Shrike kept all that information from him in order to better keep him under his control. For years, he did not even know his family name. At one point, soon after learning from Dewlanna that he was part of the famous [[Solo family/Legends|Solo line]], he ran away from Shrike on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. There, he tracked down his long lost aunt [[Tiion Sal-Solo|Tiion Solo]] and his cousin, [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]]. The reunion with his family went badly, however&mdash;his aunt was a housebound madwoman while his cousin was a sadistic bully who eventually sold him out to Shrike.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> \n\nHan did not learn about his parents, [[Jonash Solo|Jonash]] and [[Jaina (Elder)|Jaina Solo]], until he reached adulthood. Solo hid the fact that he was descended from [[Berethron e Solo]], a king of Corellia who introduced democracy to the system.<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" />\n\n====Adventures with Shrike====\n{{Quote|I sentence you to death, Solo. May you rot in all the hells there ever were.|[[Garris Shrike]]|<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />}}\nHan Solo visited many [[Planet/Legends|planets]] on the behest of Shrike. During a mission on Corellia, Han befriended the half-breed [[Bey]], an individual he would later encounter during the [[Nagai]] Invasion, shortly after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. There are also scattered reports that claim Han Solo was present on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] during the [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|battle]] there, near the tail-end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Similar reports have been made about a brief run-in with [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] searching for an escaped [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] on the planet [[Socorro/Legends|Socorro]].<ref name=\"ghost\">{{Tales|11|Ghost (comic story)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Young_Han_Solo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Han cares for the injured [[Bey]].]]\nSolo's education was spotty, like those of the other children Shrike used as beggars and thieves. Though most of the children received only an elementary education from the ship's [[Computer/Legends|computer]] on ''Trader's Luck'', he managed with Dewlanna's help to pick up some knowledge of mathematics, physics, and history by reading in his spare time. Intermittently, he would attend school while going undercover as part of a \"respectable family\" while Shrike was running a complicated con. At one point, Solo briefly attended a school where [[Garm Bel Iblis/Legends|Garm Bel Iblis]] gave a speech. Afterward, he asked the [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] two insightful questions, which impressed Bel Iblis. Years later, during the [[Thrawn campaign]] (9 ABY), the senator would still recall meeting Solo.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nSolo earned his keep for Shrike doing a variety of unsavory jobs. He once joined a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] group operated by cutthroats [[Lemo]] and [[Sanda]]. He made a name for himself racing [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] [[Swoop/Legends|swoops]] professionally and on the independent circuit. In these days, Solo made an enemy out of a Corellian swoop jockey named [[Dengar/Legends|Dengar]]. During one highly publicized race through the crystal swamps of [[Agrilat Region|Agrilat]], Solo caused Dengar to crash headfirst into a crystalline plant, severely crippling the other racer. Dengar, who would hold a grudge against Solo for the rest of his life, would later become a bounty hunter contracted to find him.<ref name=\"Payback: The Tale of Dengar\">{{StoryCite|story=Payback: The Tale of Dengar|book=Tales of the Bounty Hunters}}</ref>\n\nIn [[12 BBY/Legends|12 BBY]], Solo was sentenced to fight in the [[Regional Sector Number Four's All-Human Free-For-All]] on the penal-colony world of [[Jubilar/Legends|Jubilar]] for cheating at cards, a felony there. Matched against three other human fighters much larger than himself, Solo somehow managed to defeat the other gladiators in unarmed combat, suffering numerous broken bones. Just prior to the onset of the fight, Solo caught a glimpse of a mysterious figure wearing [[Mandalorian armor/Legends|Mandalorian armor]], his first encounter, albeit indirect, with the notorious [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]].<ref name=\"The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett\">{{StoryCite|story=The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett|book=Tales of the Bounty Hunters}}</ref>\n\nIn [[10 BBY/Legends|10 BBY]], Solo was ready to leave ''Trader's Luck'' in order to start his own career. He made plans to stowaway aboard ''[[Ylesian Dream]]'', an automated freighter, and go to [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]], where he would apply for a job opening advertised by the Ylesian high priests. When Solo was about to leave, Shrike and a few of his cohorts caught him as he was saying goodbye to Dewlanna. The armed men tried to stop Solo, but Dewlanna sacrificed herself so that Solo could escape. Solo promised to himself that, if ever he had the chance, he would help one of Dewlanna's people to repay his debt to her.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\n===Pre-military career===\n{{Quote|Inspiration's a specialty!|Han Solo|<ref name=\"Lost Legacy\">''[[Han Solo and the Lost Legacy]]''</ref>}}\nSolo stowed away aboard ''Ylesian Dream'' and after a difficult flight, he arrived on Ylesia. He applied for the piloting job under the alias ''[[Han Solo/Legends|Vykk Draygo]]''; he was to pilot the ''Ylesian Dream''&mdash;being a drone ship, it had been falling victim to pirate attacks. A [[Togorian/Legends|Togorian]] by the name of [[Muuurgh]] was assigned to be Solo's 'bodyguard', and, despite some initial tension due to the nature of the relationship, Solo and Muuurgh became fast friends. Solo also developed a relationship with one of the pilgrims who had come to Ylesia seeking religious sanctuary&mdash;a Human woman by the name of [[Bria Tharen]]. Solo remained in the High Priests' employ for a time, but after discovering the true nature of the operation&mdash;a complete scam designed to lure Pilgrims into becoming slaves&mdash;he fled the planet with Tharen, Muuurgh, and [[Mrrov]], Muuurgh's wife-to-be. Also key in his flight was that Bria, who had also learned the truth about the Ylesian fraud, was to be married to [[Ganar Tos]]. In the process, Solo and Tharen stole a small cache of treasures from the High Priest Toroenza's treasure room and indirectly killed [[Zavval]], the Hutt administrator of Ylesia. This would come back to haunt him later in his life as many bounty hunters would be after him due to the bounty placed on his head by Zavval's relatives.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nSolo and Tharen eventually made their way to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] so that Solo could fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. There, Han received a referral from Tharen's father, [[Renn Tharen|Renn]], to the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]], qualifying him for the entrance examinations without a credential from a [[Sector Naval Academy]].<ref name=\"Warfare\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref> Han also had his identity completely changed, including new retinal patterns by [[Nici (criminal)|Nici the Specialist]]. They remained together for a short time, but in the end Tharen left Solo without warning because she felt that she was holding him back. She felt that her struggles with the addictive \"Exultation\" of the Ylesian [[t'landa Til]] would hinder Han's career.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nSolo took the entrance exams for the Imperial Academy on Coruscant, doing poorly on the cultural portions and advanced mathematics, but excelling in technical knowledge and the piloting tests. During the test, Solo flew through the [[Arch of Triumph]] rather than taking the parade route above it, thus earning the fastest time for an assigned flight run. Despite his unorthodox conduct, Solo was accepted into the Academy and assigned to a two-year program of flight instruction on [[Carida/Legends|Carida]].<ref name=\"Warfare\" />\n\nJust after he was accepted into the [[Carida Academy/Legends|Academy of Carida]], Solo was attacked by Garris Shrike, who was one of the few people who knew that 'Vyyk Draygo' and Han Solo were the same person. Han was certain to have been doomed to Hutt retribution, but another [[Unidentified bounty hunter (Coruscant)|bounty hunter]] killed Shrike and Han was able to kill that hunter. The next day he shipped out to [[Carida/Legends|Carida]].<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\n===Service in the Imperial Starfleet===\n{{Quote|I think there was a time that Solo, who had bound his conception of honor to his service to the Empire, forgot that honor could exist outside Imperial service.|[[Tycho Celchu/Legends|Tycho Celchu]]|<ref name=\"X-Wing: Rogue Squadron\">''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:Han_saves_Chewbacca.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Solo stuns Nyklas to save Chewbacca]]\nSolo was crushed at Bria Tharen's departure, but he followed his dreams (and Tharen's wishes) and went to study at the Academy of Carida.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> There he would hone his skills as a pilot.

His [[Flight instructor/Legends|flight instructor]], [[Alexsandr Badure]], approved of him, filing a report praising Solo's abilities when he managed to land a malfunctioning [[U-33 orbital loadlifter]] by executing a number of difficult flight maneuvers, saving the lives of numerous [[Cadet/Legends|cadets]] and [[Academy Dean]] [[Horace Wyrmyr]]. Student Advisor [[Lucinta Cal-Meg]] noted Solo's innate intelligence and that he worked hard to improve his academic performance. However, many also had deep reservations about Solo's judgement, conduct, and suitability for military service, as well as his friends at the Academy. In Solo's second year, he was investigated for his role in Mako Spince's prank that destroyed Carida's [[Mascot Moon]] with a gram of stolen [[antimatter]], though Cadet [[Tedris Bjalin]]'s testimony cleared Solo of any involvement.<ref name=\"Warfare\" />\n\nSolo graduated at the top of his class with the rank of lieutenant. However, his hard-earned military career was short lived. In [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]], he was [[Suolriep Sector Group|dispatched]] to aid [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Pter Nyklas|Nyklas]] in duties including slaving and construction work. In this capacity, Han [[Skirmish near Komnor|boarded]] a derelict slaving craft to find that its cargo of Wookiee children had escaped and that a badly wounded Wookiee was in the pilot's seat. Nyklas ordered Han to skin the helpless [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], but Han refused and Nyklas swore to punish the Corellian. Shortly afterward, Han and Chewbacca were put to work on the construction of a new wing of the [[Imperial Hall of Heroes]] on Coruscant by Wookiee slaves. An enraged Chewbacca turned on Nyklas, who drew his blaster on the Wookiee. Solo refused to let Chewbacca die; he [[Stun/Legends|stunned]] his commanding officer and helped Chewbacca escape, with the assistance of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. Court-martialed and dishonorably discharged which also resulted in loss of his pension and back-pay. Worst of all, Han was blacklisted as a pilot making it next to impossible for him to find piloting with any legitimate company, as a result Solo returned to smuggling with Chewbacca (who had sworn a [[Life debt/Legends|life debt]] to the Corellian) at his side.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /><ref>The [[Dark Empire endnotes|endnotes]] of the [[Star Wars: Dark Empire (trade paperback)|''Dark Empire'' trade paperback]] claim that Han Solo was evicted from Imperial military service for a crime he did not commit.</ref>\n\nSolo later reflected that even without Chewbacca he probably would have left Imperial service anyway, due to the ridiculous regulations, incompetent officers and widespread anti-alien prejudice, and ever more frequent \u201cdemonstrations\u201d on dissident populations across the galaxy.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> He later became wanted for [[Treason/Legends|treason]], with a bounty issued to his head by the Empire.<!---original parent ref needs to be tracked down to avoid reflist error---<ref name=\"STAC\" /> --->\n\nSolo earned both classes of the [[Corellian Bloodstripe]] at some point during his military career, though the reasons for his first-class stripe are unknown. All that is known is that the events through which he earned them took place over several days. Because they were non-Imperial awards, they were the sole decorations that were not stripped from his uniform after his court-martial.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> [[Alexsandr Badure]] did later inform an interviewer that Solo's second-class bloodstripes came from an incident dealing with a Wookiee.<ref name=\"Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook\">''[[Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\n===Smuggling career===\n{{Quote|I happen to like to shoot first, Rekkon.

He had saved Chewbacca out of remembrance of Dewlanna, but it had cost him his life's dreams. Han spent much time drinking and playing sabacc, until he was accused of cheating by an irritated [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] named [[Shallamar]]. He probably would have been seriously injured if Chewbacca had not stepped in. After that, Han and Chewbacca grew much closer beginning a loyal friendship and partnership that would endure for decades.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" />\n\nSolo's friend [[Mako Spince]], who had been expelled from the Academy two years before graduation, helped Solo and Chewbacca get started as smugglers. Using [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] as their home base, the three of them enjoyed considerable success. Solo and Chewbacca also frequently worked for the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Lord/Legends|Lords]] [[Jiliac Desilijic Tiron|Jiliac]] and [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]]. They piloted many of their ships, including both Hutts' personal yachts. Solo also befriended [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], a gambler who saved him from the notorious bounty hunter Boba Fett, and [[Jarik Solo|Jarik \"Solo\"]], a street urchin who claimed to be a long-lost relative. Han knew that Jarik's claim was a lie, but he took the youth under his wing anyway. He also became romantically involved with the magician [[Xaverri]] and later fellow smuggler [[Salla Zend]]. During his time with Xaverri, Han became her stage assistant, and performed across the galaxies in her shows. He also served in the other part of her work&mdash;schemes designed to hurt the Empire and Imperial officials. At one point, Han even taught Lando how to fly in a ship that would be the center of much of Han's life-the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> Han had been entranced by the ship from the moment he first saw it and he wanted it more than anything else. During that test run, his dangerous flying scared Calrissian. After that, he decided that Calrissian did not deserve a ship of that quality and contemplated having the Hutts buy it for him or even stealing it for himself.<ref name=\"MF\">[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']]</ref>\n\nHan also bought his own ship, the ''[[Bria]]'', from Lando, and restored it to spaceworthy condition with the help of [[Shug Ninx]].<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> Having the ''Bria'' only made him want the ''Millennium Falcon'' even more.<ref name=\"MF\" /> When the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] sent a fleet to raze the Smuggler's Moon, Han and his friends rallied a force of smugglers and pirates to victory in the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (4 BBY)|Battle of Nar Shaddaa]]. Shortly after the battle, as Han was paying the Imperial admiral that the Hutts had agreed to bribe in exchange for his battle plans, the ''Bria'' was destroyed by Imperial fighters. Han and Chewbacca worked again with Mako, until he was crippled during a smuggling run in the [[Ottega system/Legends|Ottega system]]. Solo and Chewbacca continued their career on their own.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" />\n\nShort on cash, Han pawned his last stolen treasure from Toroenza's cache and entered the [[Cloud City Sabacc Tournament]].<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> Against all odds he reached the tournament finals and beat his friend Lando, winning the ''Millennium Falcon'' with his earnings. For a time afterward Han Solo and Chewbacca worked in the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], the [[Tion Hegemony/Legends|Tion Hegemony]], and other remote but potentially lucrative sectors of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Part of Solo's motivation for these travels was a desire to get away from Salla Zend and her wedding plans, as he was not ready for such a commitment.<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\">''[[Rebel Dawn]]''</ref> Solo would later boast that he had been \"from one side of the galaxy to the other.\"\n\nHan and Chewbacca then met up with another of his former classmates from the academy, [[Jahan Cross]], a Imperial Intelligence agent posing as a Imperial Diplo-serv Envoy on [[Etti IV/Legends|Etti IV]]. There they fought against some old \"friends\" of Han that lost a game of [[Sabacc/Legends|Sabacc]] to him. They were able to fight them off till the local security came and stopped the fight. Han and Chewbacca were then employed and given diplomatic immunity by Cross. Han then asked Cross what it would cost, with Cross telling him it will be at some point.<ref name=\"Agent of the Empire\u2014Iron Eclipse, Part 1\">[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 1|''Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse'' 1]]</ref> When Cross was framed for the murder of [[Dah'lis Stark]], Solo hid Stark in the secret compartments of the ''Falcon''. Solo denied to Sergeant [[Myrsk]] that he had not seen Cross since the fight. Han was then punched by Myrsk, and then Chewbacca attacked him but Han was able to calm him down. Myrsk was then forced to apologize to Han or Chewbacca would hurt him. After Myrsk and his corporal left, Solo then told Cross to leave. Cross then asked Han for a blaster, a change of clothes, and to be taken to unfinished spa called [[Eclipse station (Reltooine)|Eclipse]]. Han at first refused, but Cross promised to pay him.<ref name=\"Agent of the Empire\u2014Iron Eclipse, Part 3\">[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 3|''Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse'' 3]]</ref> After Cross discovered suspicious activity on Eclipse, he hired Solo to fly him and Ellie Stark to the satellite. Upon reaching Reltooine, the ''Falcon'' was attacked by modified [[Vulture-class starfighter/Legends|Vulture-class starfighter]]. Solo dropped off Stark and Cross, and flew off being chased by the starfighters. Solo managed to destroy the pursuing starfighters, and returned to pick up Cross and Stark from the falling space station. Solo transported Cross and Stark back to Etti IV and told Chewbacca how he was going spend the credits he had earned on a new gambling system to cheat at [[Sabacc/Legends|Sabacc]]<ref name=\"AoeE5\">[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 5|''Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse'' 5]]</ref>\n\n[[File:HanSolo.png|thumb|right|220px|Han Solo in combat gear]]\nWhile in the Corporate Sector, the ''Falcon'' was damaged after Solo and Chewbacca attempted smuggling weapons to insurgents on [[Duroon]]. However, they did collect payment from the insurgents and went to pay off [[Ploovo Two-For-One/Legends|Ploovo Two-For-One]], but in a rather creative manner. Given the prickly relationship and even outright disgust they had for each other, Han bought a foul, irritable, putrid [[Dinko (creature)|dinko]], attached the payment to it, and unleashed on the unfortunate employer. Although Corporate Sector Security arrived at the establishment where they were, Han and Chewbacca escaped their grasp relatively unscathed. Payment completed, they went off to find the outlaw tech [[Klaus Vandangante/Legends|\"Doc\" Vandangante's]] hideout, only to discover he had been taken to the Corporate Sector Authority prison at [[Stars' End/Legends|Stars' End]]. Doc's daughter [[Jessa Vandangante|Jessa]] offered upgrades and repairs to his ship, and a Corporate Sector waiver, in exchange for Han helping rescue Doc and other prisoners. Before he could take off, the outlaw techs were attacked by [[IRD starfighter|IRD-A Fighters]]. Piloting a [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunter]], Han led the other techs and Jessa in defense of the base. Despite heavy losses, they were successful. To complete their rescue mission for Jessa, Solo and Chewbacca were given two [[Droid/Legends|droids]], [[BLX-5|Bollux]] and [[Blue Max]], and went to the [[Agriworld/Legends|agriworld]] [[Orron III]] to meet up with a group led by [[Rekkon]] planning the prison rescue. Though Solo was initially only interested in getting the repairs for his ship, his motives became personal when Chewbacca was captured. After dealing with a traitor in the group, Solo and the others arrived at Stars' End. In order to gain entry, Han, [[Atuarre]], [[Pakka]], Bollux and Blue Max posed as a troupe of entertainers. The rescue proved successful; freeing Chewbacca, Doc, and the other prisoners and destroying the Stars' End in the process. After the ''Falcon'' was repaired, Solo and Chewbacca left the Corporate Sector for a time, taking Bollux and Blue Max with them.<ref name=\"Stars' End\" />\n\n[[File:Han_and_Fiolla_swoop_bike.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Han Solo and [[Hart-and-Parn Gorra-Fiolla|Fiolla]] on a [[Swoop/Legends|swoop bike]].]]\nAfter a disastrous incident on [[Kamar/Legends|Kamar]], where Solo and Chewbacca accidentally began a religion (the [[Cult of Varn]]) before having to flee with their lives, they returned to the Corporate Sector. There, they were contracted to transport cargo from [[Lur]]. When they discovered the cargo was a group of [[Lurrian]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]], Solo freed the slaves and killed the slaver [[Zlarb/Legends|Zlarb]]. Since they had not been paid for their cargo run, Solo and Chewbacca decided to track down Zlarb's partner on [[Bonadan/Legends|Bonadan]] and get the promised ten thousand credits as revenge. While on Bonadan, Han was jumped and nearly overcome by a mysterious figure and Chewbacca encountered a [[Skip tracer/Legends|skip tracer]], [[Odumin|Spray]], trying to possess their ship for debts and regulation compliance. However, Han and Chewbacca became mixed up with a CSA [[Auditor/Legends|Auditor]], [[Hart-and-Parn Gorra-Fiolla]], who was investigating the slavers also. Han went to meet an associate of hers, [[Magg]], but he betrayed them. Forced to flee on a swoop bike, they made it off planet after a harrowing encounter and planned to meet up with Chewbacca on [[Ammuud/Legends|Ammuud]]. Chewbacca was also forced to make a somewhat hurried escape. While Han and Fiolla were on the transport that was taking them to meet Chewbacca, they were attacked by pirates, who were looking for them. They escaped in one of the pirate's craft and landed at the nearby estates of the [[Mor Glayyd]]. Han and Chewbacca were eventually reunited after Han saved the Mor Glayyd from a duel which would have gotten him killed. The Glayyd estate provided Han with a way to get back to the ''Falcon'' and Chewbacca. As Han was leaving the planet, he was pursued by the pirates/slavers. However, at that point a CSA ''Victory''-class Star Destroyer intervened and tractor beamed both ships. Though they helped her break up the gang, they barely escaped being arrested by another CSA executive, [[Odumin]], who had really been the tracer Spray, and earned the enmity of a hired gun named [[Gallandro/Legends|Gallandro]]. They did, however, manage to steal the money Solo felt the CSA owed them.<ref name=\"Revenge\">''[[Han Solo's Revenge]]''</ref>\n\nGiving up on the Corporate Sector, the ''Falcon''{{'s}} crew attempted clothes legging in the [[Cron Drift/Legends|Cron Drift]] and a currency exchange scam in the [[Lesser Plooriod Cluster/Legends|Lesser Plooriod Cluster]] before finding themselves short on cash and stuck in the [[Tion Hegemony/Legends|Tion Hegemony]]. After several misadventures, they joined with Solo's old friend [[Alexsandr Badure|Badure]], a young woman named [[Hasti Troujow|Hasti]], and a [[Ruurian/Legends|Ruurian]] historian named [[S. V. Skynx/Legends|S. V. Skynx]] on a hunt for [[Xim/Legends|Xim the Despot's]] long-lost treasure ship, [[Queen of Ranroon/Legends|''Queen of Ranroon'']]. On [[Dellalt/Legends|Dellalt]], they finally discovered the treasure vaults. After run-ins with the \"[[Survivors (Dellalt)|Survivors]]\" (the descendants of Xim's soldiers) and their ancient [[war-robot]]s, Solo finally discovered the vaults. Though Gallandro followed him to the vaults and challenged the smuggler to a duel, the automatic defense systems killed the gunfighter. Solo and his associates then recovered the treasure&mdash;unfortunately for them, after all those years it had become outdated war mat\u00e9riel.

When the crew of the ''Purge'' fell victim to a horrific bioweapon created by the Empire, Han and Chewie were let out of their cells by [[Zahara Cody]], the ship's doctor, in a bid for freedom from the virus.

In exchange for the debt the gangster asked Solo to perform a dangerous mission for him. [[Sollima's chief accounting droid|Sollima's accounting droid]] was being held by the Galactic Empire, who planned to use the information inside the droid's [[Memory bank/Legends|data core]] to gain control over Sollima's [[Casino/Legends|casino]] [[Planet/Legends|world]], the [[Hollow Moon]]. Since the Aleena was keeping Chewbacca as a hostage, Solo had no choice but to agree. Solo's old friend, [[Billal Batross]], with whom they grew up together on [[Liberator (Liberator-class)|''Trader's Luck'']], joined him on the [[Mission to Moog Mot VI|mission]], as Batross also owed Sollima money he could not return.<ref name=\"ADV1\">''[[Star Wars Adventures: Han Solo and the Hollow Moon of Khorya]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Kharys3.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Han Solo and [[Katya M'Buele]] hunted by [[Kharys]] on the restricted [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Skye/Legends|Skye]].]]\nTogether, Solo and Batross infiltrated the [[Moog Mot VI Imperial garrison|Imperial garrison]] on [[Moog Mot VI]] and retrieved the droid, but Batross destroyed the droid with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] [[Laser/Legends|shot]]. He revealed that he was stealing [[Galactic Credit Standard/Legends|money]] from Sollima accounts, and the droid discovered this, so Batross covered his tracks by selling the droid to the Empire. Shortly afterward, both partners were captured by Imperial forces and interrogated. They were informed that if they double-crossed Sollima, [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Taavin]] would release them. Having no other choice but to agree, the accomplices returned the remains of the droid to the crime lord. Since Sollima needed the droid back intact, the Aleena ordered his bodyguards to shoot the scoundrels, but Batross managed to detonate a [[Bomb/Legends|bomb]] hidden inside the droid's head. In the ensuing chaos, Solo used the security key provided by Taavin to override the Hollow Moon's defense system, allowing the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Fleet]] safe passage in. Together, Batross, Solo and Chewbacca left the Hollow Moon in the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. After their successful escape, Batross believed that he would become the third member of the team formed by Solo and Chewbacca, but they were tired of Batross getting them into trouble, and left him on [[Arbra/Legends|Arbra]] amongst the [[Hoojib/Legends|Hoojibs]].<ref name=\"ADV1\" />\n\nDuring this period, Solo and Chewbacca worked for Jabba the Hutt on occasion. They also had several run-ins with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. Senators [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] and [[Leia Organa Solo/Legends|Leia Organa]] became aware of Solo when he began to lead efforts to free Wookiee slaves from Kashyyyk, as a favor to Chewbacca, who had begun to lose friends and family members to the slaving effort. Solo reluctantly allowed the Alliance to help him in this effort, despite his disdain for political causes, and the Alliance soon became one of his frequent employers.\n\nAfter being saved from an Imperial fleet over Corellia, Han and Chewie helped plant an [[Electromagnetic pulse/Legends|EMP]] charge on a shipment that was delivered to an Imperial facility over [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]] and helped steal [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] cruiser schematics on Carida.

In the subsequent battle, the Alliance forces were victorious, but several smugglers, including Jarik Solo, were killed. Han and his smuggler friends were double-crossed by Tharen who seized all the spice and treasures that were to be the smugglers' reward for the Alliance.<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" />\n\nSoon afterward, he met with Tharen again during a Hutt-sponsored treasure hunt for the [[Yavin Vassilika]]. Once again, Tharen took the prize for the Rebellion, while Solo and his smuggling associates were left with nothing. Solo and Tharen left on poor terms on both occasions, since Solo refused to give up his independent ways and join Tharen in the Alliance. However, most of his fellow smugglers assumed that he had been working with Tharen from the beginning.

Still, as small consolation, Han and Chewbacca made the [[Kessel Run/Legends|Kessel Run]] in less than twelve parsecs after an attempt to recover the dumped spice turned nasty. As a warning, Jabba hired [[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]], a novice [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], to let Solo know that he was serious about getting paid.

Solo was skeptical of the old man's supposed past as a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] and openly voiced his lack of belief in the Force, at some point while looking for a small training device for the young Skywalker, Kenobi sat down and decided to tell Solo a story on his youth about how he and [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|his master]] once fought against [[Jedi hunter/Legends|Jedi Assassin]] [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]], which Solo again found hard to believe, as although he though the [[Jedi]] were a myth he also understood they wouldn't be easy to kill were they real.<ref name=\"Once Bitten\">{{Tales|12|Once Bitten}}</ref><ref name=\"CSWE Kwannot\">{{CSWECite|II|237|Kwannot}}</ref>\n\nWhen they arrived in the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]], the crew and passengers of the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] found that the planet had been destroyed by the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]]. After they were dragged on board by the Death Star's [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beams]], Skywalker convinced Solo and Chewbacca to help him [[Rescue of Princess Leia/Legends|rescue]] Princess Leia Organa by promising \"more wealth than you can imagine.\" Han helped Luke infiltrate the massive station in stolen [[Stormtrooper armor/Legends|stormtrooper armor]] and after several misadventures, they managed to rescue the Princess and escape, at the cost of Obi-Wan's life, taken by his former [[Padawan/Legends|apprentice]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] during their duel aboard the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]].\n\nAfterward, Solo took Leia, Skywalker, and the droids to [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] to collect his reward. Though he was initially willing to abandon the Rebels and make off with his fee, an attack of conscience, (brought on partly by Chewbacca's arguments) led him to join the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] at the last moment. The ''Millennium Falcon'' joined in just in time for Solo to destroy [[Black 3]], which caused [[Black 2]] to collide with and disable [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] [[TIE Advanced x1/Legends|TIE advanced]]. This allowed Skywalker to destroy the Death Star, scoring a major victory for the Alliance and recognition for Solo. As a result of this battle, as well as his earlier involvement in rescuing Organa, Solo and Chewbacca had a bounty placed on their heads: Specifically, 300,000 credits alive, due to their crimes of the liberation of a known criminal, direct involvement in armed revolt against the Empire, high treason, espionage, conspiracy, and the destruction of Imperial property.<ref name=\"MFOWM\">''[[Millennium Falcon Owner's Workshop Manual]]''</ref>\n\n====Hero of the Alliance====\n{{Quote|You didn't rescue me.

The day after the Battle of Yavin, he shot down an Imperial cruiser that was searching for the Death Star, much to the chagrin of his superiors. The chests of treasure the Rebels had given him were stolen from him almost immediately after leaving Yavin by the space pirate [[Crimson Jack/Legends|Crimson Jack]] (who, ironically, had ties to the Hutt crime lord), leaving Solo still unable to pay off Jabba. With the help of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, Solo managed to defeat the pirate.<ref name=\"Star Duel\">[[Star Wars (1977) 15|''Star Wars'' (1977) 15]]</ref> Following the debacle, Solo gave the recovered money back to the Alliance.\n\nBroke and fearing Jabba's retribution, Solo and Chewbacca discovered an ancient cache of treasure hidden in one of Yavin 4's temples. He took the treasure to an [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] named [[Sprool]] on [[Dennogra/Legends|Dennogra]], who in turn delivered the money to Jabba. It was, however, too little and too late. Jabba kept the money and refused to call off the bounty. Han Solo was still a hunted man with a price on his head. He, however, used money earned from selling more of the treasure to purchase new [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|T-65 X-Wings]] for the Rebellion.\n\nAfter the destruction of Alderaan Han still wanted to leave the Rebellion but for now he traveled with Chewbacca, Luke, Leia and the droids to [[Muunilinst/Legends|Muunilinst]]. On the planet Leia was supposed to meet [[Mak Luunim]] who had the codes for some secret accounts of the Rebellion. When they flew with the ''Millennium Falcon'' a TIE fighter attacked them and an unknown pilot came to their aid. Afterwards the pilot crashed on a moon and Han and the others searched for him although they were still on their mission. On the moon they were attacked by a [[Reek/Legends|reek]] as soon as they found the pilot who said that his name had been [[X-7|Tobin Elad]]. On seeing the reek Han had shot with his blaster so <!-- how come? --> they were surrounded in a cave and only Luke could disburden them. Then the group traveled to Muunilinst where they discovered that Mak Luunim was dead and [[Nal Kenuun]] had the codes of the Rebellion. Therefore Luke had to win a [[Podracing/Legends|podrace]] to get the codes back. While he and Leia made a plan, Han and Tobin Elad were involved into an affray with some other racers. Later Luke won the race but Kenuun now wanted to get the head money of Han and Tobin. Leia then threatened to hurt the [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]] [[Urgiluu]] if Kenuun would not let her companions go. For this reason Kenuun exchanged the safety of the krayt dragon for the liberty of the group.<ref name=\"Rebel Force: Target\">''[[Rebel Force: Target]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:EasyMoney-TNR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Han and Chewbacca load their reward into the ''Millennium Falcon'']]\n\nAt some point, Han Solo also arrived on [[Phelarion/Legends|Phelarion]] to rescue Leia (who had crash landed after a scouting mission gone awry), as well as two servants [[Sparv]] and [[Bikum Calus]], the latter two being former acquaintances of Solo and planned to steal the [[Megonite moss/Legends|megonite moss]] for a profit.<ref name=\"Princess Leia, Imperial Servant\">\"[[Princess Leia, Imperial Servant]]\"</ref>\n\nLater, Han and Chewbacca were hired by [[Ramiz]], a [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]] on [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]], to protect his village from a band of local thugs known as the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]] led by [[Serji-X Arrogantus]]. To help with this task, Han and Chewbacca hired six misfit [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], including [[Don-Wan Kihotay]], a [[Human/Legends|Human]] who believed himself to be a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], [[Jaxxon/Legends|Jaxxon]], a [[Lepi/Legends|Lepi]] with a mean disposition, and [[Jimm Doshun]] and his droid [[FE-9Q]]. Han, Chewbacca and the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]] arrived at Ramiz's village, [[Onacra]], only to find it under attack by [[high-hound]]s. They managed to drive away the beasts, saving the life of a young girl named [[Merri Shen Doshun|Merri]] to the great relief of her father [[Oncho Shen|Oncho]], the village spokesman. But their relief was short-lived once Serji-X Arrogantus and his gang [[Battle of Aduba-3|attacked]]. Han and the Star-Hoppers did their best to defend the village but it was to no avail as FE-9Q was killed and Merri's grandfather, the [[Old One]], dismissed the hired spacers' help. Instead of relying on Han and his team, the shaman summoned a large, mythical reptilian monster called the [[Behemoth from the World Below]] to handle the invading Cloud-Riders. Many members of the Star-Hoppers died trying to destroy the creature. Using Kihotay's lightsaber, Han managed to kill the deadly beast once and for all.\nHan Solo and Chewbacca left Aduba-3 soon after, in the ''Millennium Falcon'', only to be captured once again by Crimson Jack and his gang of pirates. Princess Leia Organa had also been captured by the pirate while on her way to the [[Drexel (star)|Drexel]] system to find out what happened to Luke, and Jack intended to hold the Princess for ransom. But Han and Leia secretly devised a plan to trick the pirates into taking them to the Drexel system by claiming that the Rebels have stockpiled a treasure there. Accepting Solo's claim, Jack went to [[Drexel/Legends|Drexel]] where the met up with Luke and encountered [[Quarg]], the [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] of Drexel, and the [[Dragon Lords]]. Han managed to escape on the ''Falcon'', only to crash it near Quarg's ship. Teaming up with the Dragon Lords, Han and Luke managed to save Leia, the droids, and Chewbacca. Han then faced off against Jack in space where he shot the pirate, killing him.\n\nAfter a misadventure on the massive gambling complex known as [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]], Solo hid out for repairs on [[Orleon]] and was soon besieged by an emissary of Jabba the Hutt. Within a week, Solo had rescued the emissary from [[Stone mite/Legends|stone mites]] and, by some miracle, had the bounty taken off his head. He returned to Tatooine, and started to heal his relationship with the Hutt. He made Kessel Runs for the crime lord, even beating [[BoShek/Legends|BoShek's]] most recent record-breaking time. Sadly, this was not to last. The remains of Crimson Jack's Star Destroyer were discovered by the Hutt's agents, and within days the bounty was back on Solo's head. An even higher reward was registered for anyone who would capture him alive so Jabba could kill Solo himself.\n[[File:Second_Battle_of_Kessel.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Solo pilots the ''Falcon'' during the [[Battle of Kessel (0 ABY)|Second Battle of Kessel]].]]\n\nWhile evading Jabba's organization, Solo and Chewbacca continued to work with the Rebel Alliance for the next three years. Solo became a good friend of Luke Skywalker, and developed a love-hate relationship with Princess Leia, cementing friendships after close encounters with bounty hunters.\n\nAround this time, Han sent [[Col Serra]] to create a new unit. It would remain secret for many years.\n\nDays before the [[Evacuation of Yavin]], during negotiations with the Aquaris Freeholders, Han was \"accused\" of being an Imperial spy by Leia Organa. In truth, the accusation was just a ploy to draw out the real spy, Aquaris Freeholders deputy commander [[Kraaken]], in their midst.<ref name=\"TG\">\"[[Traitor's Gambit]]\"</ref> In addition, shortly after the discovery of the development of the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']] by Luke Skywalker during a reconnaissance mission at Fondor, Leia had him recover a [[power gem]]. Although he personally doubted the gem's existence, he took the job when he realized that the alternative was allowing Leia to send Luke to find the gem when he returned from his mission, as Luke was \"not familiar with the Underworld.\" He initially tried to find intel on the gem at [[Junkfort Station/Legends|Junkfort Station]], but his attempts nearly got himself killed when he deduced that some of the \"criminals\" who wanted to \"help\" Solo were really going to lure him to Jabba the Hutt for the monetary reward. He did nonetheless learn from one of the other attendees to locate the pirate Raskar for the sole known power gem remaining in existence. After locating Raskar and orchestrating a fight between Chewbacca and the reigning victor of the tournament outside of the ring so he could get close and find out how much power is left in the power gem, he acquired the power gem. He also swore that he'll keep the true status of the shield properties of the power gem a secret after he learned about its decrease in power, as he and the Rebel Alliance only intended to use the gem once anyway, although he secretly intended to loot Raskar of all his ill-gained items as his punishment for the scam.<ref name=\"The Power Gem\">\"[[The Power Gem]]\"</ref> After he returned to Yavin base with the power gem, however, he learned from Leia that Luke didn't make it back to Yavin due to an ambush.<ref name=\"Iceworld\">\"[[Iceworld]]\"</ref>\n\nAfter the evacuation of Yavin IV, the Rebellion was left without a base. Han and Chewbacca [[Battle of the Graveyard|aided]] Han's new elite fighting force, [[Renegade Squadron/Legends|Renegade Squadron]] led by Col Serra, in obtaining a holocron made by [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Prestor Organa]] before [[Destruction of Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan's destruction]]. The holocron, encased in [[Phrik/Legends|phrik]], survived the planet's demise and contained a list of potential bases for the Alliance. During the battle to obtain it, Han was contacted by Boba Fett, who demanded the Holocron. The bounty hunter was fought off by the squadron, however, and the holocron was successfully obtained.\n[[File:SWEMP22-FC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Han and Chewbacca run into danger on [[Aguarl 3]].]]\n\nFollowing the damage sustained in the Alderaan system, Han, Chewbacca, and Renegade Squadron landed on [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] to make repairs. However, before the repairs were finished, the droid bounty hunter [[IG-88B/Legends|IG-88]] discovered them and alerted the Imperials. During a [[Skirmish on Ord Mantell (0.5 ABY)|battle]] with them, a power converter and an energy cell were found in the junkyards. Han repaired his ship, and he, Chewbacca, and Renegade Squadron took off from the planet, narrowly avoiding a Star Destroyer squadron. Shortly after, they learned that [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] had been captured by the Empire while on a recon mission to find a new base. Han and Chewbacca helped rescue Ackbar.\n\nThe squadron learned from Ackbar that his crew had been captured by Boba Fett and sold as slaves on Tatooine. Han and Renegade Squadron landed on the planet and encountered Imperial resistance. During the [[Mission to Mos Eisley (Galactic Civil War)|skirmish there]], they learned from a Rodian contact in a cantina that the slaves were being held in a shipyard; Han, using a [[Fusioncutter/Legends|fusioncutter]], broke into the room the slaves were being held in and, along with Renegade Squadron, fought their way to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and escaped the planet. They headed back to [[Boz Pity/Legends|Boz Pity]], the new base of the Alliance. However, a tracker beacon had been placed in an R2 unit and they were tracked by Boba Fett, who then told the Imperials the location of the Rebels' new base on Boz Pity. An Imperial planetary assault force [[Battle of Boz Pity (Galactic Civil War)/Legends|attacked]] the base; Han and Chewbacca helped prepare and pilot the evacuation craft that allowed Renegade Squadron and Ackbar to flee the planet.\n\nSix months after the battle of Yavin, Han was supposed to accompany Leia to a diplomatic meeting with [[Yeeru Chivkyrie|Chivkyrie]] on [[Shelkonwa]], but was reassigned to hunt pirate groups threatening Alliance supply lines, along with Luke. However, he was uncertain of his allegiance to the Rebels and only reluctantly accepted the job. While on their mission, they encountered the [[Hand of Judgment]] and developed a tenuous relationship with them, even after both sides learned of the other's identity. Together, they defeated a group of [[BloodScar]] pirates. Learning that Leia was being hunted on Shelkonwa by the Empire and that the pirates had inside help from the governor's office there, the ex-Imperials and Rebels infiltrated Shelkonwa, with the troopers posing as their escorts while they looked for Leia. Although the rogue stormtroopers left to assist [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], Luke, Han, and Chewie found Leia and, returning to the Hand of Judgment's ship, escaped once the Hand returned. They were dropped off at the ''Falcon'' and made their way back to Alliance headquarters. Leia told him that he could stay in the Alliance for the sake of one person, and while she meant Chewie, Han preferred to think that he was in it for her, and continued to be part of the Alliance.<ref name=\"Allegiance (novel)\">[[Allegiance (novel)|''Allegiance'']]</ref>\n\nFollowing weeks of searching for Vader's [[TIE Advanced x1/Legends|TIE Fighter]], Solo and Organa stopped over at [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]], where he hoped he might make some money on the Sabacc tables and try to get Jabba his bounty. Before long, Solo found himself racing the [[Togorian/Legends|Togorian]] [[Alfreda Goot]] to Tatooine, after the bounty hunter kidnapped Organa. Before long, Solo had inadvertently handed Vader back over the Empire<!-- this whole sentence could use a better phrasing! and more details. -->, encountered a prototype [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']], and rescued the princess of Alderaan, all within the span of a short amount of time.\n\nLater on, Han, accompanied by Chewbacca, Leia, and Deena Shan, traveled to the planet of [[Aguarl 3]]. During an untimely detour on the dangerous planet, Han and his first mate, Chewbacca, were attacked by the creatures native to the planet. Fortunately, Leia and Deena were able to save them from the dangerous native wildlife.\n\n[[File:LumpyChewieItchySolo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Han Solo is greeted by [[Mallatobuck/Legends|Malla]], Lumpy and [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]].]]\n\nNearly a year after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction of the Death Star]], Chewbacca and Han left for the celebration of [[Life Day/Legends|Life Day]] on Kashyyyk. It served as a short break between the periodical fighting. But peace did not last long for the pair. Not long after they departed Tatooine for Kashyyyk, they found themselves once again being chased by the Empire. Fleeing to lightspeed, they went on their way. However, the Empire had apparently traced their route to Kashyyyk, which they rightfully suspected to be a harbor for rebels. Upon learning of this, Darth Vader ordered a blockade and search of the planet. A group of Imperial officers entered Chewbacca's home, terrorizing his family and wrecking the house. They looked for any sign of rebel activity. However, after a while, Chewbacca's son, who then went by the name [[Lumpawaroo/Legends|Lumpawarrump]], devised a plan. He used his [[mini-transmitter]], which he had received as a Life Day present from [[Saun Dann]], to send out a voice message through the Imperial airwaves&mdash;which changed the sound of Lumpy's voice. He gave the command of \"return to base,\" which the officers in the home picked up on their receivers. They complied, with the exception of the stormtrooper known as [[B4711]], who was ordered by a superior to stay behind in order to temporarily watch the house for rebel activity. However, the trooper soon learned of Lumpy's trick, and pursued him through the house, out onto the balcony, where Han and Chewbacca had just arrived. Chewbacca roared as Han managed to kill the trooper. That night, the group, along with the other Wookiees on Kashyyyk, celebrated an uninterrupted Life Day.<ref name=\"The Star Wars Holiday Special\">''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''</ref>\n\n[[1 ABY/Legends|One year after the Battle of Yavin]], Han provided support for [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]] and [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] during the [[Battle of Corellia (1 ABY)|battle of Corellia]] and evacuated the [[Coronet Capitol Tower]].\n\nAs part of the Rebel Alliance, Solo undertook many missions while trying to evade Jabba's organization. However, no matter how Han tried, he still encountered many bounty hunters who wished to carry out Jabba's bounty. On one such occasion, Han and Chewbacca returned to Ord Mantell where he encountered another bounty hunter seeking to collecting Jabba's bounty, the [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Skorr/Legends|Skorr]]. Skorr had planned to use Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa to lure Solo into a trap. Solo and Chewbacca managed to evade the trap, rescuing Skywalker and the Princess in the process. Skorr accidentally killed himself with his blaster during a duel with Solo.\n\nWhen the Alliance lost a large shipment of [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] on its way to a Rebel medical facility, Solo was asked to use his underworld contacts to uncover its whereabouts. When conversation with fellow smugglers provided several leads, Solo arranged a meeting with Alliance [[Major/Legends|Major]] Bhan in a cantina on Corellia. However, instead of Bhan, an [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|ISB]] posing as a smuggler approached Solo and engaged in a conversation. It was soon interrupted by an arrival of Solo's friend [[Col Serra]], who informed him that Bhan was bush-walked on Tatooine, supposedly by the same individual Solo was talking to. The undercover agent tried to deny it, but Solo and Serra confronted him anyway. After a short fight, they subdued him and, leaving him on the floor, departed, oblivious to the fact that the operative managed to place a tracking device on Solo. Later, when the shipment was discovered to be located on the [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] [[Skip 52]] in the [[Smuggler's Run/Legends|Smuggler's Run]], Rebel agents traveled there and managed to defeat ISB personnel trying to secure the ryll. Solo and Chewbacca took the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] to Skip 52 to help return it back to the Alliance, but were tracked via the beacon placed on Solo. A second team of ISB agents arrived to secure the shipment, and this time they were successful. Solo and Chewbacca managed to escape in the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] with a few crates of ryll, though the rest had fallen into the hands of the Empire.<ref>{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|scenario=Dark Side scenario campaign}}</ref>\n{{Talesstart}}\nOn another occasion, Han and Chewbacca came into the possession of some valuable glowing [[Tandgor gem]]s, which he claimed would pay off debts and help pay to modify the ''Millennium Falcon''. They stopped on an unknown planet to get fuel. After landing on the planet, Solo and Chewbacca were confronted by groaning skeletal figures; [[Zombie/Legends|the undead]]. Chewbacca was able to fight them off and made a hasty retreat back to the Falcon only to find the fuel line had been severed by someone. Arming themselves, the two-man crew of the Falcon headed back and came face to face with a local and her baby who explained to the two that the crew of a \"[[Great Interplanetary Ark]]\" perished after their ship crashed in the planet's fog. They were compelled to wander the planet as corpses, terrorizing the locals every night.\n\nUsing the Tandgor Gems to lay down lines, Han formed a makeshift runway that managed to dissolve the fog. A ghostly apparition of the ship that crashed long ago used it to land, easing the spirits of the perished crew. The living dead would no longer terrorize the planets residents. Han and Chewbacca left the planet out of pocket, but were rewarded with enough fuel to last them the rest of their journey.\n{{Talesend}}\n\n====Crisis on Cloud City====\n[[File:Han_vs_Probe_Droid.png|thumb|left|250px|Han firing at an [[Viper probe droid/Legends|Imperial probe droid]] on [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]].]]\n{{Quote|You like me because I'm a scoundrel.|Han Solo to Leia Organa|<ref name=\"Episode 5\" />}}\nAfter run-ins with bounty hunters such as [[Skorr/Legends|Skorr]] and [[Cypher Bos]] on [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]], Solo resolved to leave his friends in the Rebellion and finally settle things with the Hutt. After Luke Skywalker disappeared while on patrol, Han went out to search for Luke on a [[Tauntaun/Legends|tauntaun]], although he ended up stranded alongside Luke in the blizzard. Because of these circumstances, he was forced to use his recently deceased Tauntaun as a makeshift heat source by borrowing Luke's lightsaber to cut its innards open until morning when [[Zev Senesca/Legends|Zev Senesca]] located him in a search operation. Likewise, during patrol, he managed to find a [[Viper probe droid/Legends|Viper probe droid]] and destroyed it, although not before it transmitted images of the Rebel shield generator and thus gave away their location. Before he could finish repairs on the ''Millennium Falcon'' and leave the Rebels' [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base]], however, he was caught up in the Imperial [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|attack on Hoth]]. [[File:Han_tortured_AOSWG2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Han [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] by Darth Vader.]] When Princess Leia and C-3PO were cut off from their evacuation ship, Solo took them on board the ''Millennium Falcon'', which avoided Vader's [[Death Squadron/Legends|Death Squadron]] by hiding in the [[Hoth asteroid field/Legends|Hoth asteroid field]]. When they were nearly trapped in the gullet of a [[Exogorth/Legends|space slug]], Han flew the Falcon back out into the asteroid field where they were almost immediately detected by the Star Destroyer [[Avenger/Legends|''Avenger'']]. Han, ignoring a warning from C3PO, moved his ship into an attack approach, flying directly over Avenger's bridge. Subsequent tracking of the Falcon turned up no trace; Han had outwitted Avenger's command by attaching his ship to the rear of the Star Destroyer's conning tower with the Falcon's landing claws. Han and his passengers later escaped undetected by drifting off amongst ''Avenger''{{'s}} garbage dump before Avenger went into hyperspace. During their escape, Solo and Leia began to show their affection for each other, which would later lead to them falling in love.\n\nSince the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} repairs were still not complete, Solo went to the nearest safe haven&mdash;[[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]], home to Solo's old friend Lando Calrissian's [[Tibanna/Legends|tibanna]] mining facility, [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]]. Unfortunately for Solo, he had been beaten there by Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Under duress, Calrissian made a deal with the Dark Lord to betray the Rebels in exchange for the continued autonomy of Cloud City. Calrissian invited them for \"refreshments,\" and led them into a room where Darth Vader sat, waiting. Han, with one of the fastest draws of his life, pulled his blaster and fired a couple shots at Vader, who easily blocked them and snatched the blaster out of Han's hands using the Force. Then, Boba Fett and stormtroopers surrounded the Rebels, capturing them. Solo was badly tortured on a scan grid by the Imperials who, according to him afterward, never even asked him any questions. While in his cell, Calrissian came and told the agonized Han about the custody of Leia and Chewbacca and Vader's plan to trap Luke Skywalker. Uncaring about the consequences and furious at his friend's betrayal, Han slugged Calrissian before being subdued by the administrator's guard detail.\n[[File:HanCarbonite-BHUSC.png|thumb|left|150px|Han Solo ''\"[[Man in Carbonite]]\"'']]\nShortly afterward, Han was taken by the Imperials to be frozen in carbonite as a test to ensure that Luke Skywalker would survive a similar freezing. There, surrounded by Darth Vader and his personal guard, he spoke his last words before being frozen. In response to Leia saying, \"I love you\" Solo responded, \"I know.\" ({{Audio|ILoveYouIKnow-ESB.ogg|Listen}}) After being frozen, Han Solo went into a state of hibernation.\n\nFett, dubbing Vader's handiwork, ''[[Man in Carbonite]]'',<ref name=\"Shadows of the Empire 1\">[[Shadows of the Empire 1|''Shadows of the Empire'' 1]]</ref> loaded the slab containing Solo aboard the Slave I, and departed for [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]]. After escaping Bespin, Skywalker, Leia, Chewbacca, and a repentant Calrissian set about planning Solo's rescue.\n\n====Rescue====\n{{Quote|Chewie&hellip; Chewie, is that you? Ch.. Chewie.

As a result of careful planning, Solo was brought out of carbon freeze by Leia disguised as [[Boushh/Legends|Boushh]], temporarily suffering from blindness, a symptom of hibernation sickness. However, Jabba was aware of Leia's real identity and imprisoned Han Solo while Leia was to become his new slave replacing his previous favorite Oola. In his cell in Jabba's Palace, Solo was reunited with his partner Chewbacca. During his short period of captivity, a [[B'omarr Order/Legends|B'omarr Monk]] named [[Sai'da]] interviewed Solo, wishing to record the famous smuggler's history. With the arrival of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo was brought once more before Jabba. He tried to barter for his life but to no avail, as he was considered a failure by Jabba. Han reunited with Luke as the two were sentenced to death and carried off to the Sarlacc pit.\n\n[[File:Trust_Me_TCG_2017_Quarter_2_Tournament_Kit.png|thumb|right|250px|Solo rescues Calrissian from the sarlacc]]\nAt the Sarlacc pit, Luke turned the tables and a battle broke out. During the fight Calrissian redeemed himself by risking his life to save his old friend. Solo accidentally set off Boba Fett's jetpack which sent him flying into [[Khetanna/Legends|Jabba's sail barge]] then into the Sarlacc (though the hunter escaped well after the skirmish had ended.) Solo then managed to rescue Lando from one of the Sarlacc tentacles while hanging from one of the damaged [[Bantha-II cargo skiff/Legends|skiffs]], despite hibernation sickness still affecting him. The fighting ended with Leia killing Jabba and Han being reunited with his friends. The heroes quickly escaped Jabba's barge as it exploded due to a chain reaction set off by Luke by firing its cannon into its hull at point-blank range, and then left Tatooine after a fierce sandstorm when Luke revealed he had to go to Dagobah.\n\nSometime after this incident, Han volunteered to [[Skirmish at Ithor|rescue]] [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorians]] from the Empire. Han and Chewbacca found the Ithorians, destroyed several TIE Fighters, and dodged asteroids. They even ran into three more [[Exogorth/Legends|space slugs]], barely missing him as they did during the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]].\n\n====Attack on Endor====\n[[File:HanEndor.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Han Solo on [[Endor/Legends|Endor]].]]\n{{Quote|There's only a few guards.

He led a [[Endor strike team/Legends|commando team]], which included Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Chewbacca, on a mission to Endor to destroy the [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star II's]] shield generator, which would allow a fleet led by [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Ackbar]] and Calrissian--now also a general--to move in and attack the station, hopefully capturing or killing the Emperor in the process.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" />\n\n[[File:Han_solo_6.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Han and Leia sharing a passionate kiss on Endor.]]\n\nOn Endor Leia became separated from the group when she chased after two [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout troopers]] on a [[74-Z speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]]. Worried, Han, Chewbacca, and Luke, accompanied by R2-D2 and C-3PO, searched through Endor's thick forest in order to locate her. However the group fell into a trap that appealed to Chewbacca's stomach and was captured by [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]], natives of Endor. They were eventually freed with the help of Threepio&mdash;who the Ewoks mistook for a deity&mdash;and Luke. Following their initial encounter, Han and the others became part of the Ewok tribe, forming a close bond with them.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" />\n\nAfter their initiation into the tribe, Han led his strike force to the [[Endor shield generator bunker|shield generator bunker]]. Solo didn't know, however, that he was walking into a trap; Palpatine himself knew of their attempt to destroy the generator. Solo and his force were captured, while a [[Battle of Endor/Legends|battle]] raged in space between the Rebel and Imperial fleets.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" /> Fortunately, with the help of the Ewoks and a timely reunion with Renegade Squadron, Han and the other Rebels were able to turn the tables and capture many Imperial troops.<ref name=\"BF:RES\">''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron]]''</ref> After planting several [[7-PrG proton grenade]]s, Han destroyed the shield generator in time, killing Captain [[Sarkli]] on the way out (while also noting that Sarkli had picked the wrong side of the conflict),<ref name=\"RS III\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]''</ref> allowing General Calrissian to begin his attack on the Death Star. The Death Star was finally destroyed, taking the Emperor with it. As the explosion of the Death Star lit the skies, Han said he was sure Luke got off in time, and Leia said \"I can feel it.\" Han, thinking Leia was in love with Luke, offered to step aside when he came back. Leia corrected Han, telling him Luke is her brother, shocking Han, and they shared a kiss as the celebration began. Solo later joined in the evening's banquet.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" />\n\n===Hero of the New Republic (4 ABY&ndash;19 ABY)===\n{{Quote|Hey, Chewie, come on.

The remaining Imperial forces were outnumbered and outgunned by Ssi-Ruuk invaders and, after the intervention of Alliance forces held off the alien invaders, the result was a truce between the Imperials and the Rebels. Han was uncomfortable in the presence of so many Imperials, and his customary lack of tact annoyed some of them as well. While on Bakura, Han tried to deepen his relationship with Leia, but circumstances kept them from spending much time together, and Leia was also distraught by seeing a vision of Anakin Skywalker. After a successful engagement led to the withdrawal of the Ssi-Ruuk, Imperial governor [[Wilek Nereus]] betrayed the Rebels and ordered them targeted. Leia was arrested shortly afterward for sedition but was rescued by Han. In orbit in the ''Falcon'', Han prepared a ramming maneuver to allow the surrounded Alliance forces to escape. Fortunately, Luke was able to convince the Imperial fleet commander to surrender. Solo then aided the short, swift Bakuran overthrow of the government and was present at the surrender of Nereus. Shortly afterward, the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] was founded.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\">''[[The Truce at Bakura]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:HanSolo-NEGTC.png|thumb|left|130px|Han Solo]]\n\nSolo later commanded Rebel forces in the [[Battle for the Eclipse|Battle for the ''Eclipse'']] in the ''Millennium Falcon'' that temporarily teamed with [[Tyber Zann]]'s forces against Imperial forces in order to destroy the semi-built [[Eclipse (Eclipse-class)|''Eclipse'']]. However, he was knowledgeable enough of Zann's character to suspect that Zann had ulterior motives in aiding the Rebel Alliance in the battle, and made clear that the instant he suspects that he'll betray them, he will kill them before wishing Zann and his group good luck. Together, Zann's fleet and the Solo-commanded rebels destroyed three [[Cardan-class space station|''Cardan''-class space stations]], and as soon as a boarding party of Zann's had taken over the ''Eclipse'', Solo realized Zann's ruse and attacked, but he and the rebels were soon driven away. Zann proceeded to destroy what remained of the Imperial fleet there and stole information he desired from the ''Eclipse'' before leaving it.<ref name=\"EaW:FoC\">''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption]]''</ref>\n\n====Encounter with Boba Fett====\nThough he won the Battle of Endor, Solo found himself in need of credits. Refusing to accept money from the House of Alderaan and the Rebel Alliance, Han, along with Princess Leia and R2-D2, went to Tatooine to access Han's bank account. However, his account was frozen due to his encasement in carbonite. Shortly afterward, R2-D2 was captured by [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]]. Unbeknownst to Han, the Jawas also captured Boba Fett, who was suffering from amnesia after escaping the Sarlacc. Han leaped from his moving landspeeder and entered the sandcrawler's cargo hold to find Artoo and Boba Fett; he was surprised the bounty hunter survived the Sarlacc too. Fett had temporarily lost his memory and helped Solo rescue R2 from the sandcrawler and onto the racing landspeeder. Unfortunately for Solo, Fett regained his memory due to Leia's constant repetition of Solo's name. Fett tried to shoot Solo, but missed. Solo and the others fled, leaving Boba Fett and the Jawas to be eaten by the Sarlacc. However, Fett was regurgitated by the Sarlacc, again.\n\n====Nagai-Tof War====\n{{Quote|The more I hear about these Nagai and their allies, and the more I see of their handiwork&mdash;the less I like it.|Han Solo to [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]|<ref name=\"Star Wars (1977) 100\">[[Star Wars (1977) 100|''Star Wars'' (1977) 100]]</ref>}}\nAfter the Alliance of Free Planets was established, Solo, along with Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian were sent on several missions to bring secure attendees for the [[First Conference of Free Peoples]]. After these recruitment missions, the group decided to take a break to visit Chewbacca's family on Kashyyyk. Arriving on the planet, the group felt a sense of uneasiness about [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]]. With Chewbacca leading the way, they made their way to Chewbacca's home. However, they fell into a trap set by Chewbacca's brother-in-law, [[Vargi]], and his mysterious companion, [[Ozrei N'takkilomandrife|Knife]]. As it turned out, Knife's true intention was to set up a slave ring on Kashyyyk, using Chewbacca's family as hostages to keep the Wookiees in line. Fortunately, Han and Lando were able to break free.\n\nWhile Lando contacted the Alliance, Solo tried to keep Chewbacca from being brought onto a slaving ship. He managed to free Chewbacca but was interrupted by Vargi. Vargi dragged Chewbacca aside and proceeded to beat him for his attempt to escape. Han could not bear to see Chewbacca being unmercifully beaten and struck Vargi. Furious, Vargi went on a rampage and struck Solo, rendering him unconscious. Shortly afterward, Lando returned with weapons and armed the Wookiees still loyal to the Alliance. The Wookiees overthrew their rogue counterparts just as Chewbacca was able to overpower Vargi, throwing him to the ground. Han woke up just in time to see Knife escaping from the battlefield. Though Knife's slave ring had been dismantled, the skirmish on Kashyyyk would mark the beginning of the [[Nagai\u2013Tof War]].\n\nThings went from bad to worse as certain members of the Alliance began to grumble about the manner in which the leadership of the Alliance was run, claiming it was too oppressive. The leaders of the discontent parties gathered on Kabray to share their concerns with one another. Most attending the gathering were non-military members of the Alliance, and had contributed little to the Rebellion's fight against the Empire. In order to prove that their leadership was not aloof, Admiral Ackbar dispatched Han and Princess Leia, along with four Zeltrons as an escort, to the meeting on Kabray. Unfortunately, Han and Leia walked right into a trap and were captured by the [[Nagai]]. While Han and Leia tried to formulate a plan involving Leia pretending to faint, the Zeltron set their plan in motion, taking out the guards. Eventually, the Nagai were all rounded up and captured by Solo and the others, averting the Nagai's strategic win on Kabray.\n\nShortly after the skirmish on Kabray, the Nagai forces and their Imperial allies attacked the forest moon of Endor, officially starting the Nagai-Tof War. While Ackbar led forces in space, Han and Luke ventured off to investigate a disturbance in the forest that had been reported by the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[Tippet/Legends|Tippet]]. They found a squad of Nagai and [[Maccabree]] preparing to attack the Alliance base, covered by the diversion taking place in space. While Luke set off to warn the base, Han encountered the traitor Bey.\n\nAlthough Bey bested Solo in hand-to-hand combat, the Nagai [[Commander/Legends|commander]], Knife, intervened and tried to shoot Han. Bey had not wanted to kill Han and so tackled Ozrei knocking the shot off target. This gave Solo a chance to grab his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and shoot Ozrei&mdash;and he did not miss. An anguished Bey revealed Ozrei was his half-brother, and allowed Han to continue on to the listening post. By the time he arrived there, the Maccabree had been driven off, flying away in their flight-suits.\n[[File:BeyHanfight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Han and [[Bey]] brawl on the forest floor.]]\n\nThe war escalated once the Nagai's sworn enemies, the [[Tof]]s, joined the war. The final battle of the war came at the [[Battle of Saijo]] after the Alliance allied with the Nagai and Empire against the Tofs and their leader Prince [[Sereno]]. Once the Alliance learned of Sereno's and [[Lumiya]]'s Saijo, a strike team consisting of Han, Princess Leia, Luke, Dani, Knife, Den Shiva, and one stormtrooper were sent to Saijo to neutralize the threat. Han and others were able to defeat the Tof and Lumiya, causing Prince Sereno to surrender. The Nagai Tof war finally ended.\n\n====Tracking Zsinj====\n{{Quote|Kiss my Wookiee!|Han Solo to [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Zsinj]]|<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" />}}\nThough not always a formal member of its military, and never holding official political office, Han Solo played an important role as part of the New Republic. Solo was instrumental in the [[Liberation of Kashyyyk/Legends|Liberation of Kashyyyk]], eliminating its oppressors such as the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaver]] [[Pekt]] and [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Hindane Darcc/Legends|Hindane Darcc]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]''</ref> Solo went on to take part in the defeat of many warlords.\n\nIn [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Zsinj]]'s attacks on the New Republic had the populace frightened and discontented. Due to his reputation and public image, Solo was given command of a [[Solo Fleet|fleet group]] and charged with hunting down and killing Zsinj. His flagship was the ''[[Mon Remonda]]'', a [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser/Legends|Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]]. Under his command were several other Mon Calamari cruisers, a few Imperial Star Destroyers, smaller frigates, and several starfighter squadrons, including [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]], [[Wraith Squadron]], [[Polearm Squadron]], and [[Nova Squadron]]. Han and Zsinj played a dogged game of each pursuing and trying to trap the other. In one effort, Han employed a fake ''Millennium Falcon'', known as the ''[[Millennium Falsehood]]'', and another time got the aid of an Imperial [[Immobilizer 418 Interdictor-class Heavy Cruiser|Immobilizer 418]] interdictor cruiser under the command of [[Teren Rogriss]], his Imperial anti-Zsinj counterpart. In his final fleet battle against Zsinj in late 7 ABY, Solo and his fleet were led to believe that they had destroyed Zsinj's flagship, the [[Iron Fist (Executor-class)|''Iron Fist'']] [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]]. However, Zsinj had fooled them by detonating a [[Second Death|reconstructed Star Dreadnought]] as cover while the ''Iron Fist'' jumped into hyperspace.<ref name=\"X-Wing: Solo Command\">''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''</ref>\n\n====Disastrous courtship====\n{{Quote|You always see the worst, don't you? I don't know why I put up with you!''\"<br />\"''Because of my charm and great looks?|Leia Organa and Han Solo|<ref name=\"Shadows of the Empire: Evolution\">''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire: Evolution]]''</ref>}}\nFollowing the hunt for Zsinj, Han returned to Coruscant and discovered&mdash;much to his dismay&mdash;that Leia was asked for her hand in marriage by [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Isolder]] of [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]]. At a formal reception the Hapes delegation presented Leia with a number of gifts which included a Hapan [[Gun of Command]] and a special plant. Jealous and depressed, Han went into the undercity of Coruscant and won ownership of the planet [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]] in a game of sabacc. Soon after he kidnapped Leia and took her to the planet to win her heart. However, they soon learned that the planet was home to the Dathomiri \"Force witches\" as well as Warlord Zsinj's hidden base of operations. Han was captured by one of the witch clans who hoped to trade him to Zsinj in exchange for a transport to escape Dathomir. Han was tortured by [[Gethzerion]], the leader of the witches, before being rescued by Luke single-handedly piloting the ''Millennium Falcon'' with the aid of the Force.<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" />\n\n[[File:Han-Leia_Wedding.jpg|thumb|left|The wedding ceremony of Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo.]]\n\nBack at the helm of the ''Falcon'', Solo managed to get past the shields of Zsinj's flagship. Solo called up Zsinj on the comm, telling Zsinj to \"kiss [his] Wookiee\" right before firing two concussion missiles into the bridge of the ship, killing the warlord instantly and essentially turning the tide of the [[Battle of Dathomir (Hunt for Zsinj)|Battle of Dathomir]].<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" />\n\nAfter the Zsinj crisis, he [[Wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa/Legends|married]] Leia, which made him the husband of the New Republic's [[Minister of State]] and eventually [[Chief of State (New Republic)/Legends|Chief of State]]. Later that year Han and Leia were [[Mission to Tatooine (Killik Twilight)|sent]] to Tatooine, with [[false prints]] and retina-concealing contacts disguised as a red-skunned Devaronian and a blue-skinned Twi'lek respectively, to recover the Alderaanian [[Moss painting/Legends|moss painting]] ''[[Killik Twilight]]'' which held an encrypted [[Shadowcast]] key which contained codes once in use by the Alliance. During their trip on Tatooine, the pair met many people who had known Anakin Skywalker when he had been a nine-year old slave and [[Podracer/Legends|Podracer]]. A snag was thrown into the mission when a group of Imperials were also competing for the painting. They included [[Kitster Chanchani Banai|Kitster Banai]], the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[W. Wald|Wald]], and the younger sister of [[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru Whitesun]], the woman who had raised Luke as his \"Aunt Beru\" and had been present during the burial of his grandmother [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|Shmi Skywalker]]. They also discovered Shmi's diary with the help of the [[Darklighter family/Legends|Darklighters]] who now owned Luke's moisture farm. From this diary, Leia discovered that her father had not always been the evil monster she thought he was and learned to forgive him. Enlisting the help of some [[Squib/Legends|Squibs]], Han and Leia went on a long chase to finally retrieve the painting, during which Han became lost in a sandstorm and suffered from dehydration. Leia and the [[Darklighter family/Legends|Darklighter family]] rescued him and they were eventually able to retrieve the Shadowcast key, although the Empire gained possession of the painting.<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\">''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''</ref>\n\nThis adventure on Tatooine gave his wife a new understanding of Anakin Skywalker. Soon, Leia made plans with Han to start a family. Later, it was learned that she was pregnant with [[Solo twins|twins]].<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\" />\n\n[[File:Han_Leia_Tatooine.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Han and Leia on Tatooine]]\n\n====Return of the Empire====\nDuring the [[Thrawn campaign]] in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], Solo was heavily involved in foiling several of [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] schemes. While trying to take care of his wife and unborn children, he was also involved in several diplomatic missions, some to fringe groups to recruit them, and some accompanying Leia on official New Republic delegations. Han helped fend off multiple attacks by the [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]] commandos on Leia, using what could best be described as unorthodox tactics to defeat them. When suspicious bank account activity implicated Admiral Ackbar, Han went to Lando to find a [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] to investigate the accounts. Lando and Han subsequently visited [[Talon Karrde]] on [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]] to recruit a slicer, but events soon changed their mission completely when an Imperial Grand Admiral arrived and Han and Lando discovered that Karrde had been holding Luke Skywalker prisoner. Adapting to the situation, he and Lando evaded the Imperials and helped rescue Luke from the stormtroopers searching for him&mdash;both with Karrde's help. Following their departure from [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]], Han and the rest of the crew aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' became embroiled in the [[Battle of Sluis Van]], where they attempted to disable the [[Plasma-Jet Mole Miner|mole miners]] that Thrawn was using to steal New Republic ships. While Lando was successful in preventing the theft, most of the ships were severely damaged. While Han labored to aid the New Republic against the Empire, he also had to deal with the political machinations of ambitious [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] leader [[Borsk Fey'lya]].<ref name=\"HE\">''[[Heir to the Empire]]''</ref>\n\nHan continued his search for the truth behind Ackbar's accusations and Fey'lya's activities, journeying to [[New Cov/Legends|New Cov]]. While following [[Tav Breil'lya]], Fey'lya's aide, Han was stopped by [[Sena Leikvold Midanyl|Sena]], but before they had much for discussion, they were interrupted by an Imperial raid. Fleeing in the ''Lady Luck'' with Lando&mdash;Leia had been using the ''Falcon''&mdash;Han and Lando were escorted back to [[Peregrine's Nest]], where they met the legendary Corellian Senator [[Garm Bel Iblis/Legends|Garm Bel Iblis]] and his private army. Han was impressed at seeing the former Senator again, even referring to him as ''sir'', a title that rarely slipped from his lips. After Lando realized that Bel Iblis's ships had come from the [[Katana fleet|''Katana'' fleet]], Han and Lando began a race with the Empire to find Bel Iblis's contact who had supplied the ships. Their search led them to the ''[[Coral Vanda]]'', but a detour and ambush instigated by [[Niles Ferrier]] slowed them enough to allow the Empire to reach the contact, [[Hoffner]], first. Thanks to coordinates supplied by Talon Karrde, who also knew of the fleet's location, Han, Lando, Luke, and a small team traveled to the location of the fleet, arriving before the Empire did. As battle erupted, Han helped fend off the Imperial boarders while the New Republic Frigate ''[[Quenfis]]'', its fighters, [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]], and some of Karrde's ships held off the Star Destroyer [[Judicator/Legends|''Judicator'']]. The arrival of Bel Iblis aided greatly in the battle, but the tide was finally turned when Han remotely piloted another Dreadnaught into the second Imperial Star Destroyer that had arrived, destroying it.<ref name=\"DFR\">''[[Dark Force Rising]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:SoloFamilyDEHandbook.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Han Solo with his newborn children]]\n\n====Becoming a father====\nHan was present when his wife gave birth to [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]], and was quite nervous and excited. When [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] infiltrated the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]] not long afterward, Han and Leia defended their children until help could arrive. As a result of the attack, the Noghri, who had been persuaded to help the New Republic, sent bodyguards to protect the twins while Han, Luke, Chewbacca, Artoo, Threepio, and Mara Jade went to destroy the [[Mount Tantiss/Legends|Mount Tantiss]] fortress after springing Mara out of arrest. After landing the ''Falcon'' on [[Wayland/Legends|Wayland]], Han and the others journeyed through the inhospitable forests, fending off predators and other hazards. Reaching the fortress, they were joined by more Noghri, who had been clearing paths for them. Infiltrating the mountain while the local inhabitants launched a diversion, the [[Wayland insertion group]] attempted to destroy the cloning facility, with the help of Leia, Lando, and Talon Karrde, who had arrived to help in the ''Wild Karrde.'' Aiding Mara and Luke, who were challenged by the insane Jedi Master [[Joruus C'baoth]], Han tried to shoot the deranged Jedi, but was hit with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] and had his gun snatched out of his hand.<ref name=\"TLC\" />\n\nSolo also played an important role in the defeat of the resurrected [[Palpatine/Legends|Emperor Palpatine]] in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]] including infiltrating the [[Emperor's Citadel]] on [[Byss/Legends|Byss]].<ref name=\"DE1\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]''</ref> It was also during this time that his wife learned that she was pregnant with a third child: [[Anakin Solo]].<ref name=\"DE2\" /> In [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], during the [[Battle of Onderon (Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Onderon]], he shot the last clone of the Emperor in the back, killing it. However, the Emperor's spirit tried to enter the infant Anakin though he was stopped by the Jedi Knight [[Empatojayos Brand]], who sacrificed his life for Anakin.<ref name=\"EE\">''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing that, he and Chewbacca traveled to Kessel to persuade the planet to join the New Republic. Unfortunately for them, they only encountered hostility from the planet's [[Rybet/Legends|Rybet]] governor [[Moruth Doole]] and were put to work in the spice mines of the planet. During their captivity, they met a young Force-sensitive boy named [[Kyp Durron]] who helped them escape from Kessel. While escaping from Kessel, they avoided Doole's ships by flying into [[Maw Cluster/Legends|The Maw]], an unusual concentration of black holes.<ref name=\"Jedi Search\">''[[Jedi Search]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Last_Clone_Body.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Han kills the last clone body of Palpatine.]]\n\nIn the Maw, they discovered the Imperial research center [[Maw Installation]] which was under the command of Admiral [[Natasi Daala|Daala]], the only female Admiral in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. It was there that they discovered the [[Death Star prototype]] and the [[Sun Crusher]]. They eventually escaped Daala with the help of one of the researchers [[Qwi Xux]] and stole the Sun Crusher. Fleeing from the Maw installation, Han flew the Sun Crusher through one of Admiral Daala's four [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyers]] destroying it. Admiral Daala's three Star Destroyers pursued the Sun Crusher and fought Doole's ragtag navy in a space battle above Kessel. Han would later play a role in the [[Battle of the Maw]] Installation, which resulted in the destruction of the Death Star Prototype and the Sun Crusher.<ref name=\"CotF\">''[[Champions of the Force]]''</ref>\n\n====Jedi Search====\n{{Expand|1}}\n{{Quote|When I can learn to ignore '''you''', I'll be a true Jedi Master.|Luke Skywalker to Han Solo|<ref name=\"Shadows of the Empire: Evolution\" />}}\n[[File:Leia-DarkApprentice.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Han and Leia during Kyp's fall to the dark side.]]\nLater when Luke was disabled by Kyp Durron and the spirit of an ancient Sith Lord named Exar Kun, Han and the family went to visit the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 and were baffled by his condition. During the dinner that followed, Leia, along with the twins and the students felt a great disturbance in the Force when the planet of Carida was destroyed by Kyp Durron. Han, who had befriended Kyp Durron, knew he was the only one with a chance of stopping him before he killed thousands more. Han and Lando took the ''Falcon'' in order find the errant Kyp. Once they found him, Han attempted to reason with Kyp and was making progress when Lando disabled the Sun Crusher with pre-existing command codes. However, Kyp bypassed the codes easily and was preparing to destroy the ''Falcon'' when Exar Kun was defeated by Luke's students. Free of the Dark Lord's influence, Kyp yielded and was taken back to Coruscant for sentencing.<ref name=\"CotF\" />\n\nAs Luke began the process of restoring the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], Han, along with Leia and Chewbacca set out on a mission of their own, vital to the survival of the fragile New Republic. They began searching for the long-lost children of the Jedi. The quest took them to the Jedi planet of [[Belsavis/Legends|Belsavis]], a nearly forgotten frozen world. Having heard tales of a Jedi exodus from the dark crypts below the planet's surface, and also hearing that since the time of the exodus no one entering the crypts has returned alive, Han, Leia, and Chewbacca journeyed to Belsavis to start their search. <!-- Needs some concluding details here from Children of the Jedi --><ref name=\"CotJ\">[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']]</ref>\n\n====Darksaber incident====\nIn [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]] Han accompanied Luke to Tatooine where the Jedi Master had hoped to make contact with Obi-Wan Kenobi. After they arrived under the ruse of Tusken Raiders, Han and Luke visited Jabba's palace. They encountered a former associate of Jabba's, in the form of a disembodied brain connected with a life support system and a [[BT-16 perimeter droid|BT-16]] droid, in the tradition of the mysterious [[B'omarr Order/Legends|B'omarr Monks]]. This former man, pleased to see enemies of Jabba, informed Han and Luke that the Hutts were planning to build another [[Darksaber (superweapon)|superweapon]]. Soon after the discovery, Solo and Skywalker revealed it to the New Republic, however, [[Durga Besadii Tai|Durga the Hutt's]] subordinates stole the plans from the Imperial Palace by creating a distraction through an \"accidental\" discharging of an honor guards' ceremonial blaster rifle. In order to find out the location of the superweapon, the New Republic launched a covert operation to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] that involved Leia, Han, General [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]], Admiral Ackbar and then-general Wedge Antilles. Disguised as a diplomatic summit, Madine was able to infiltrate Nal Hutta, and deposit a small tracking device on Durga's ship, while Han, Leia and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] met with Durga inside one of his bathhouses, who then allowed the New Republic access to one of his data slicers. It was this data slicer who revealed, much to Han's bewilderment and dismay, that the various Imperial [[United Warlord Fleets|Warlord fleets]] were [[Imperial Reunification|unified]] and under the command of one Admiral Daala. After returning from the successful mission on Nal Hutta, Leia felt a stirring of the Force inside her, identical to the distress call Luke sent out to her above Bespin, and from the same sender. Han and Leia then moved in and rescued Luke and Callista near the Hoth asteroid belt in the ''Millennium Falcon''. After this rescue, Han flew Luke back to his Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, only to nearly run headlong into Admiral Daala's Super Star Destroyer ''[[Knight Hammer]]''.

Han, Chewbacca, and Lando went to rescue her, but ended up delayed by the confusion caused by the outbreak of the [[Death Seed]] plague, and also they did not know where she was. Fortunately Leia was able to escape by defeating the Hutt Jedi, [[Beldorion]]. Soon after Han reunited with Leia and participated in the [[Battle of Nam Chorios]], as a commander. The battle ended when Luke Skywalker managed to convince the Chorian crystal mind of the threat that Ashgad posed to the galaxy if his plans succeeded.

Han had been increasingly worried about the change he had seen in Luke, in part due to his suspicions of [[Waru]], the cult's leader. He was also warned by an old acquaintance, Xaverri, to be wary of Waru. Originally unbeknownst to Han, Hethrir kidnapped his children and intended to sacrifice the Force-strong Anakin to Waru, which came from another dimension known as [[Otherspace]].

Does that come with a hat?|Han Solo, after his appointment to [[Commanding officer/Legends|commanding officer]] of the [[New Republic Fifth Fleet|New Republic Fifth Battle Group]] in [[16 ABY/Legends|16 ABY]]|<ref name=\"SOL\">''[[Shield of Lies]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:Han-blackfleet1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Han at the time of the [[Black Fleet Crisis]].]]\nDuring the [[Black Fleet Crisis]] from [[16 ABY/Legends|16]] to [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], while his wife was serving as Chief of State, Han was charged with the day-to-day responsibilities of raising their three young children: officially, Admiral Ackbar insisted that he retained his rank and security clearances as a General, as Leia's personal \"liaison for domestic defense\".<ref name=\"BefSt\">''[[Before the Storm]]''</ref>\n\nBecause of his wife's role as Chief of State, there were many attempts on her life. It was then that the [[Yevetha]] struck. An alliance of Yevethan worlds known as the [[Duskhan League]] intended to cleanse the [[Koornacht Cluster/Legends|Koornacht Cluster]] of all non-Yevethan species. They were armed with the [[Black Fleet]] which consisted of the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Intimidator (Executor-class)|''Intimidator'']] (which had been renamed ''Pride of Yevetha'') and its smaller escort [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]] which they procured during a revolt against their Imperial master eight months after the Battle of Endor.\n\nDuring this time, Han was temporarily given the rank of [[Commodore/Legends|commodore]] and was placed in charged of a massive New Republic fleet sent to patrol the borders of the Cluster. However, his [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] was yanked out of hyperspace by a Yevethan [[Immobilizer 418 Interdictor-class Heavy Cruiser|Immobilizer 418 cruiser]] and he was brought before the Yevethan [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Nil Spaar]] on the Yevethan homeworld of [[N'zoth]]. During his incarceration, Nil Spaar once transmitted a hologram to Leia in which he brutally assaulted Han for twenty minutes, saying only, \"Leave Koornacht now\".\n\nHowever, this only gave the New Republic a reason to invade the Koornacht Cluster and deal with the Yevetha. Several Wookiees including Chewbacca and his son rescued Han Solo from his prison on the ''Pride of Yevetha'' through the use of the ''Millennium Falcon''. The New Republic was aided by the enslaved Imperials who mutinied against their Yevethan masters despite having no love for the New Republic. The Yevetha were finally defeated at the [[Battle of N'zoth]] and were disarmed and placed under close watch.<ref name=\"TyrT\">''[[Tyrant's Test]]''</ref>\n\n====Almanian Uprising====\nLater in 17 ABY, Han met up with [[Jarril]], an old smuggling associate of his, in the [[Crystal Jewel]] Casino on Coruscant. Jarril had came to warn Han about things happening in the Smuggler's Run.<ref name=\"The New Rebellion\">''[[The New Rebellion]]''</ref> Han didn't really take him too seriously, until the Senate Hall was bombed during the course of their conversation. Han rushed off to the ruins of the Senate Hall and found that Leia had been injured in the attack. He felt that the attack had something to do with what Jarril had been warning him about, so traveled to [[Skip 1]] on the [[Smuggler's Run/Legends|Smuggler's Run]], along with Chewbacca, to investigate.\n[[File:Han-Assault_at_Selonia.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Han during the [[Corellian Crisis]].]]\n\nHan met a lot of his old smuggling friends, such as [[Ana Blue]], [[Zeen Afit]] and [[Kid DXo'ln]], who were a bit hostile to him, as they considered him to have gone legit. However, after finding the wreck of Jarril's ship, Lando Calrissian believed that Han was in trouble and headed to the Run to find him, despite the fact that [[Nandreeson]], a crime lord based on the Run, had a placed a bounty on him. Lando was soon captured and when Han learned of this, he rallied together a number of smugglers to help rescue him. However, the smugglers were actually in Nandreeson's pay and turned on Han during the rescue attempt. However, Han shot Nandreeson in the mouth with Chewbacca's bowcaster, killing him and allowing Han, Lando and Chewbacca to escape. They returned to Skip 1, where, shortly after, a number of droids bound for Coruscant, exploded and injured a lot of the smugglers. Han helped to transport some of the injured to Wrea, aboard the Falcon. Ana Blue also revealed to him that [[Kueller]] on [[Almania/Legends|Almania]] was behind everything.\n\nHan traveled to Almania and picked up Mara Jade on the way, despite the fact that he still didn't trust her, because she provided some [[Ysalamiri/Legends|ysalamiri]] to use against Kueller. When they arrived, the [[Battle of Almania]] was in progress between the New Republic and Kueller's forces. Han landed on the planet and went to help Luke and Leia, who were already there, but his ysalamiri were eaten by a [[thernbee]]. Nevertheless, his plan still worked, as the creature moved towards where Luke and Kueller were dueling and the ysalamiri pushed the force out of the area, allowing Luke to defeat Kueller.\n\n====First Corellian Insurrection====\n{{Quote|He's not a nice man, to put it mildly.|Han Solo on his cousin [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]]|<ref name=\"AAC\" />}}\nIn [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]], Han and the family took a vacation to Corellia, where they were hosting a trade summit in order to boost Corellia's economy. However the [[New Republic Intelligence Service]] remained wary of Corellia, maintaining that the situation at Corellia was unstable. En route to Corellia, [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Belindi Kalenda]] attempted to warn Han Solo and Chewbacca not to travel to Corellia&mdash;or at least not take his children, as Corellia was no longer safe. Distrustful, Solo refused to take her advice, seeing the trip as a family holiday. Once there, the Solo family decide to settle in with Governor-General [[Micamberlecto]], and hired a Drall tutor, [[Ebrihim]], as well as his droid, [[Q9-X2]], to watch over their children while they were attending the trade summit. However Han soon discovered that the [[Sacorrian Triad]] and the [[Human League]], headed by his cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo, was causing a [[Corellian Crisis|political uprising]] that only went from bad to worse.<ref name=\"AAC\" />\n\nThrackan declared himself Diktat of the Corellian System and declared the system's secession from the New Republic. He also used Centerpoint's power to jam all system-wide communications, and demanded that all nonhuman races are to leave the system within a month, or he would vaporize a wide variety of New Republic planets. Han realized that Lieutenant Kalenda was right and aided in her escape. However, Han was captured by Human League thugs in the process.\n[[File:CaamasCrisis2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Han during the [[Caamas Document Crisis]]]]\nImprisoned with the Selonian [[Dracmus]], Han was forced to fight the female Selonian for his cousin Thrackan's amusement. However, communicating in Selonian, the two mostly staged the fight. Fortunately, the two were rescued by other Selonians, and, on a primitive [[Selonian cone ship|coneship]], managed to escape to [[Selonia/Legends|Selonia]]. On Selonia, Han met up with Leia and Mara Jade and the three tried to convince the Overden to change their minds to the immense outrage of the Selonians. The Overden immediately released the three because of the grievous nature of Thrackan holding the Solo children hostage just as Luke Skywalker arrived, and the group planned a course of action. Enraged, the Sacorrian Triad waged war, and the [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Corellian Crisis)|Battle of Centerpoint Station]] began. Han participated in the war, and with the help of Luke, Leia, and Lando Calrissian, he was able to end the Insurrection and put Thrackan in jail. Han's children also played an important role in the battle as Anakin was able to use a planetary repulsor to stop the Starbuster beam from destroying [[Bovo Yagen (location)/Legends|Bovo Yagen]].<ref name=\"SaC\">''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], Solo made a nostalgic return to Jubilar, hoping to relive the adventurous times of his smuggling days. While negotiating a deal with [[Incavi Larado|Mayor Incavi Larado Baker]] to transport a shipment of [[Jandarra]] to the planet [[Shalam]], Solo was attacked by Boba Fett, who had been informed of Solo's presence on the planet by Baker, an old informant.<ref name=\"The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett\" /> After a short fight, the two agreed to end their long-standing grudge and go their separate ways.\n\n====Caamas Document Crisis====\nDuring the final days of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] Solo acted as an unsuccessful mediator in the [[Diamal]]a/[[Ishori]] dispute. Solo and Calrissian led a mission to [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] to retrieve a copy of the [[Caamas Document]].<ref name=\"SotP\">''[[Specter of the Past]]''</ref> Soon afterward, he was part of the final New Republic victory over the [[Imperial Remnant]] at the [[Battle of Bothawui (Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Bothawui]].<ref name=\"VotF\">''[[Vision of the Future]]''</ref> Soon after the Caamas Document crisis, Han and the family attended Luke's and Mara's wedding on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Union\">''[[Star Wars: Union]]''</ref>\n\nAll three of his children were trained as [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] at Luke Skywalker's [[Jedi Praxeum]] from [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], and Han and Chewbacca would often visit them with the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Young Jedi Knights\">''[[Star Wars: Young Jedi Knights]]''</ref>\n\n===Yuuzhan Vong War===\n{{Quote|I k-knew from the s-s-start this wasn't my war.|Han Solo|<ref name=\"UF\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:HanSoloAndChewbacca-VPcoverJapan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Han Solo and Chewbacca during the early years of the Yuuzhan Vong War]]\nHan was involved in two of the first battles of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War|Yuuzhan Vong invasion]]. He aided in the evacuation of [[Sernpidal/Legends|Sernpidal]], where the [[Yuuzhan Vong|Vong]] brought a moon down on the planet. However, they were unable to save [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewie]], who had saved [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]] from the impact by sacrificing himself. Anakin, knowing that going back would result in the death of the passengers aboard the ''Falcon'', took off from the planet. He also aided [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] forces in the [[Battle of Dubrillion]].<ref name=\"VP\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]''</ref> After this he returned home to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] with [[C-3PO|3PO,]] as the others continued to help in the war effort. Han went into a period of grief. He closed himself off from friends and family, did little to care for himself, and turned to [[Alcohol/Legends|alcohol]]. His children commented on his increased alcohol consumption on several occasions, and there was obvious disconnect within the family. For a short time he blamed his son for the death of his long time friend. This was very painful for his son, Anakin, who heard his father's words echo in his mind, \"You left him, you left Chewie!\". Eventually, Han reconciled with his son- who feared they would not be as close anymore- after coming to terms with the fact that he understood why his son had made the decision he had. Following the reconciliation Han realized he had never fully blamed his son but had been trying to distract his mind from blaming it on himself, and he felt as though Chewie would be unable to forgive him. Struggling with grief, and paying little attention to his loved ones advice, Han pushed the blame onto the Vong, who were most at fault for Chewbacca's death. This caused him to behave uncharacteristically and made him unconsolably enraged with the Vong.\n\n====Adventures with Droma====\nA few months later, still dealing with grief, he left his family on Coruscant to go help his old friend, [[Roa]]. Roa was taken prisoner by the Yuuzhan Vong on [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]]. Han then teamed up with his new friend, [[Droma]] to help save Roa. Also around this time, Han met and befriended [[Vergere]], who had given him the antidote to cure Mara Skywalker of her disease. <!-- Could use more details from Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial. --><ref name=\"AoCI\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref>\n\nHan and Droma eventually traced the Ryn's family to a ship piloted by members of the [[Peace Brigade]] that dropped off refugees at Vong targets. Han and Droma finally found the ship at [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor]] and rescued Droma's family while Kyp Durron and others rescued refugees, including Roa from a nearby ship. They then all witnessed the destruction of three-fourths of the Hapan fleet and half of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet by [[Centerpoint Station]] fired by his cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo.<ref name=\"AoCII\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''</ref>\n\n====Hero's trial====\n{{Quote|You're a danger to yourself, and everyone around you, but I do love you.|Leia Organa Solo|<ref name=\"UF\" />}}\n[[File:Hanherostrial.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Han Solo after Chewbacca's death.]]\nSolo decided that he could be best used helping the New Republic, rather than moping around in grief. He was assigned to the terraforming project on [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], and worked with Jacen and Jaina to try and maintain a small refugee habitat on the surface. After his habitat was overrun by Yuuzhan Vong insects, he went to a nearby habitat which he was surprised to find was being run by Leia. The situation soon became very bad when Leia was captured and almost killed by Warmaster [[Tsavong Lah]]. Jacen and Jaina soon rescued their mother and the ''Falcon'' blasted into hyperspace from Duro.<ref name=\"BP\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''</ref>\n\nAfter Duro was taken by the Yuuzhan Vong, Han and Leia fled to Corellia for Leia to recover but were chased away by Thrackan, who was now [[Governor/Legends|governor]] of the planet. They then decided to take a short break to try and close the rift in their marriage that was formed by Han's grief over Chewbacca. While on vacation, Han and Leia ran into a previously unknown group of Jedi called the [[Wild Knights]] which was lead by [[Saba Sebatyne]], and helped bring them to Luke's attention, and into the limelight of the war. When they returned to Coruscant, Han and Leia gained temporary custody of their nephew, [[Ben Skywalker]], and the two formed a close bond.<ref name=\"rec\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Recovery]]''</ref>\n\nSoon after, the Yuuzhan Vong created [[voxyn]], Jedi hunting creatures that quickly killed many in the Jedi Order. To Han's dismay, Anakin volunteered to lead a strike team to [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]] to destroy the voxyn cloning project. Han was reluctant to let Anakin lead in fear of losing someone else close to him. Although the mission was successful, Han's worst fears were realized when Anakin was killed fighting the extragalactic invaders during the mission, and Jacen was captured and presumed dead. Han and Leia helped each other deal with the grief of a lost son, and ended up with a stronger relationship.<ref name=\"SbS\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Han-rebelstand.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Han Solo during the Battle of Borleias.]]\n\n====War's end====\nDuring the [[Battle of Borleias (Yuuzhan Vong War; First)|occupation]] of [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]], Han, Leia and Jaina all played key roles in maintaining the New Republic's hold as long as possible. Han and Leia dropped out of hyperspace into the middle of an enemy fleet, along with the Super Star Destroyer ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]''. Thanks to Han's piloting, the ''Falcon'' and its cargo of Myrkr strike team survivors escaped the engagement unscathed. Han would later ferry those survivors to the Maw shelter, although he nearly turned back when Jaina came under attack. Han wanted to go to Coruscant in search of Jacen, but Leia talked him out of it, telling him that she needed him in the new [[Insiders]] organization. After they returned to Borleias from the Maw, Han continued to help Wedge in his defense of the planet.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref> After his son's surprise return from [[Coruscant/Legends#Yuuzhan'tar|Yuuzhan'tar]], Han lead a small fleet of Smuggler's Alliance ships to help with the ambush over [[Ebaq 9]].<ref name=\"DW\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''</ref> After that, Han, Leia, Jaina and [[Tahiri Veila]] went from system to system trying to re-establish communications with the far flung reaches of the New Republic.

While there, they met [[Harrar]], a Yuuzhan Vong [[Priest/Legends|priest]]. Solo also played a major role during the [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar|Recapture of Coruscant]]. Leia and Han, along with the Yuuzhan Vong priest, Harrar, Threepio and Artoo, crashed the ''Millennium Falcon'' into the well of the [[World Brain]]. With the help of Harrar and revolting Yuuzhan Vong heretics, they captured the [[Senate Building/Legends|Well of the World Brain]]. After the destruction of [[Shimrra Jamaane|Shimrra]] and [[Onimi]], Han and the others traveled with [[Nom Anor]] across the labyrinth the mighty war vessel of the Master Shaper. However, the executor turned on them, shooting his venom at Solo. Jacen managed to save him just in time. Before he could kill them off, Leia engaged Nom Anor, slicing off his hand in the process. They managed to escape and arrived at [[conclave on Zonama Sekot]], which marked the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War. After the war ended, he allowed Chewbacca's son Lumpawaroo and nephew [[Lowbacca]] to carry on Chewbacca's life debt.<ref name=\"UF\" />\n\n===The Dark Nest===\n====A cry for help====\n{{Quote|Bugs! Why did it have to be bugs?|Han Solo, on first encounter with the [[Killik/Legends|Killiks]]|<ref name=\"dn1\" />}}\nDuring the five years of reconstruction after the Yuuzhan Vong war, Han and Leia were often doing the Jedi one favor after another to help an order that was stretched too thin. Because of all the help he gave to the Jedi Order they considered him a member, leading him to joke that he wanted a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. They also helped the Ithorians find a new home after the devastation of their planet, [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]], during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]].\n\nHowever, he and Leia finally refused to help the Jedi when they heard that Jaina and several other Jedi Knights had been drawn to the Unknown Regions by a mysterious calling in the Force. Eventually, Han and Leia decided to follow several Jedi including Luke, Mara, and Ben into the Unknown Regions, where they discovered that [[Raynar Thul]] was alive, and had been taken in by a nest of [[Killik/Legends|Killiks]]. During the mission to Myrkr, Thul had been incapacitated by the Nightsister [[Lomi Plo]] and the Dark Jedi [[Welk]]. They took him and escaped on the ''[[Tachyon Flier]]'', which was under fire during Myrkr outbound, where all three were presumed lost. In truth, the ''Tachyon Flier'' had crashed onto the planet [[Yoggoy]], a Killik nest, and made all three Force-users into [[Joiner]]s. Raynar Thul was integrated into the Yoggoy nest while Lomi Plo and Welk were integrated into the [[Gorog]] nest. [[File:Solodarknest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Han Solo during the [[Swarm War]].]] All became leaders of their respective nests, Raynar even created a new lead nest named [[Unu]] and became the [[Prime Unu]], now reborn as UnuThul. They found that many non-Killiks had become part of the nests&mdash;part of the hive mind&mdash;after being around the Killiks for too long. These were called Joiners, and Han was terribly afraid that Jaina would become a \"bug hugger\" like the Joiners. The Yoggoy nests, and each other nest, except for Gorog, gained Raynar's sense of compassion and value for life, whereas the Gorog nest retreated into secrecy, due to the want of Lomi Plo and Welk to hide. The Gorog became the Dark Nest, and secretly controlled the other nests, without their even knowing.\n\nUnuThul greeted the Solos in Yoggoy hangar with a masterful display of his current Force power. In the [[Prime Chamber]], UnuThul used \"we\" to address himself, stating Raynar Thul no longer existed and \"they\" were now UnuThul. Luke insisted that he sensed Raynar's presence in UnuThul, and guessed Raynar might be in hiding. Raynar then guided the Jedi to read the [[Chronicle]] on the wall, explaining the transformation of Raynar Thul to UnuThul, and the rise of the Unu nest. UnuThul explained the Unu nest as \"the nest of the nests\".\n\nStill refusing to surrender the location of [[Qoribu]], UnuThul stated that anyone could leave whenever they wanted, and decided to assign a Yoggoy guide to escort the Jedi back to Lizil. The Jedi soon realized that such a collective mind allowed UnuThul to spy on them almost anytime and anywhere on Yoggoy. They visited the crash site, and Leia received Jacen's [[flow-walking]] message about Qoribu which was in the [[Gyuel system]]. Insects dark blue in color then attempted to assassinate the Jedi Masters at the crash site, which the Jedi barely escaped with [[Nanna]] killing several blue insects in the process. However, the Yoggoy guide that accompanied the Jedi denied ever seeing any blue insects before its death. When they traveled back to the hangar, Han and UnuThul exchanged harsh words on the matter of attempted assassination. As the debate became a stalemate, Luke proposed that it was another party who attempted to assassinate the Jedi, but UnuThul insisted that even if someone else attacked the Jedi, the hive mind would also be aware.\n\n====Swarm War====\nJust prior to the Swarm War, Han and Luke had been taken prisoner by the Killiks in order to gain help for stopping the [[Fizz (acid)|Fizz]]. Fortunately for them, both Solo and Skywalker were resistant to the joining process. They eventually escaped and participated in the offensives against the Killiks. During the crisis, Han and Leia were captured by the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] so they would not stop the Swarm War. They escaped, and eventually stopped the Chiss from unleashing their bio-weapon on the Killiks.\n\nAround this time Han and Leia found out about the birth of Tenel Ka's daughter Allana, unaware that she was their granddaughter through their son Jacen. Tenel Ka's and Jacen's reluctance to talk about Allana surprised them which caused Han to remark that the father must have been ugly if Tenel Ka refused to talk about her.\n\nThe entire crisis was a nightmare for Han, due to his traumatic experience years before with the [[Kamarian]]s of the [[Cult of Varn]]. That experience had given him a deep-seated unease around [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] insects.\n[[File:Han-Swarm_War-Japan_cover.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Han and Leia during the [[Swarm War]].]]\n\n===Second Galactic Civil War (40 ABY&ndash;41 ABY)===\n====Rising tensions====\n{{Quote|On the one side, the fact that his own cousin is Chief of State of Corellia and is playing this slippery, deceptive political game bothers him a lot.

The incident sparked political unrest that threatened to ignite into total rebellion that could shatter the young [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]]. In a desperate attempt to avoid such a fate, the Alliance readied a preemptive display of military might in a bid to bring the rogue worlds to heel. In a display of poor decision-making, Corellia, Solo's home planet, was chosen as target of this exercise.\n\nSince Han Solo was a Corellian, this incident turned him against the Galactic Alliance. Worse, relations with his son Jacen and the Skywalkers were ruined after Jacen chose to stand with his uncle, Luke Skywalker, on the side of the Galactic Alliance. But when the Corellians launched a counterstrike, armed conflict was ignited and civil war broke out among those of the Galactic Alliance. As the Galactic Alliance began making more repressive laws, many began seeing it as a new Galactic Empire. Throughout the Galactic Alliance, families found themselves divided and old friendships were torn apart.\n\nThat year, alongside Wedge Antilles, Han led Corellian forces at the [[Battle of Tralus (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Tralus]]. Han's actions were vital as he flew one of the [[YT-5100 Shriek-class bomber|bombers]] that led to the destruction of the Alliance's base and stronghold on Tralus. His daughter and wife were in the opposing Alliance fleet, although Leia was secretly aiding the Corellians by instructing fighters not to attack Han's and Wedge's ships.\n\nAnd while all this was going on, his son Jacen Solo became what the Jedi feared most: a Sith.\n\n====Allegiance with Corellia====\n{{Quote|I don't know who you are, but you aren't my son anymore.

Fett agreed to help Han, in exchange for aid in finding his long-lost daughter, [[Ailyn Vel]]. Solo posed as a Mandalorian soldier working for Fett, and began strangling Thrackan shortly after encountering him, but Boba Fett's granddaughter [[Mirta Gev]] actually made the killing shot, with Boba and Han adding at least three more. Sadly, Ailyn Vel had been killed by Jacen during an interrogation. Horrified and outraged, Han disowned his son saying his son would never have done such a thing. Afterward, Han questioned Leia upon Jacen's upbringing, wondering if they were at least partly to blame.\n\n[[File:Exilecropped.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Han and Leia during the [[Second Galactic Civil War]].]]\nShortly afterward, Han, Leia, and C-3PO were summoned to the Kiris Asteroids where the secret Corellian fleet was located. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by Wedge Antilles who was recently promoted to the rank of admiral. Han believed that he was summoned to help Antilles defeat the Blockade of Corellia but he was proven wrong once Dur Gejjen interfered. Instead of leading the attack with Wedge, Han and Leia were tasked with being decoys in order to draw Queen Mother Tenel Ka onto Corellia's side. Though disappointed, Han nonetheless did as he was told though he felt suspicious and uneasy. Traveling to Hapes in order to warn Tenel Ka of danger, Han and Leia learned that Gejjen had been using the Solos to disrupt Tenel Ka's security routine and draw her out into the open for an attack. In the process of warning her, Han and Leia unexpectedly walked into an assassination attempt on her life by the assassin [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Nashtah]]. Due to a series of unfortunate events, the two were forced to work with the assassin in order to escape. The three then set their course for Telkur Station. En route to the station, Han and Leia felt uncomfortable around Nashtah, though they insisted on finding the identity of the coup's leader. During their conversation, Nashtah revealed to Han and Leia that she'd seen Leia's father race in the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]]. It was then that Leia revealed the reason for having children, though Han was upset about revealing such information to a stranger.<ref name=\"Tempest\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]''</ref>\n\nThey arrived on Telkur Station, only to encounter Jagged Fel, who was presumed lost after the Battle of Tenupe during the Swarm War. During their conversation, Fel revealed that he was marooned on Tenupe for two years after being shot down by Leia. While on Tenupe, he had discovered that Alema was still alive and seeking to kill Leia and her family in revenge for crippling her during their last duel. He also revealed that his family was going through financial troubles, causing him to become a bounty hunter. After the conversation, the three were drugged while Jagged slipped away. Han and Leia eventually escaped Nashtah, only to gain a new passenger by the name of [[Lalu Morwan]]. After delivering their findings to Tenel Ka, Han disarmed Morwan and locked her up in one of the Falcon's compartments, burning one of his hands from blaster fire in the process. Shortly afterward, Han and Leia came across Jaina, Zekk, Ben and his crew, taking them aboard the Falcon during the [[Battle of Hapes (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Hapes]]. However, Jacen ordered the Star Destroyer ''Anakin Solo'' to open fire upon the ''Millennium Falcon''. Han and Leia escaped the confrontation, but with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} turrets and central core destroyed by the turbolaser blasts. During the battle, Han's nephew, Ben Skywalker, attempted to arrest Han and Leia for crimes against the Galactic Alliance. In an attempt to arrest the two, Ben accidentally slashed Zekk in the abdomen when he was restraining Ben, severely injuring Zekk. After making sure that Jaina, Zekk, Ben and his crewman escaped, Han and Leia escaped into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nAfter escaping into hyperspace, Han and Leia traveled to [[Tendrando Arms]] to repair the ''Millennium Falcon''. There, Han and Leia reunited with Lando Calrissian, who left with them in his personal yacht, the ''[[Love Commander]]'', and left C-3PO with the Falcon. They managed to get through Corellia's security zone, partially due to their deceitful disguises and Leia's use of a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]].<ref name=\"Exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref>\n\n====Break with Corellia====\nMeeting with Denjax Teppler in a Coronet cantina, they discovered that Teppler nor Wedge knew of the conspiracy to kill the Queen Mother and that it was the doing of Dur Gejjen. After their conversation, the group was forced to exit the cantina after several CorSec officers tracked Teppler to the cantina. Leia, Han, and Lando parted ways with Denjax shortly thereafter, being chased back to the Love Commander. Only with the intervention of the Pulsar Skate and the ''[[Errant Venture/Legends|Errant Venture]]'' were Han and the others able to defeat the Corellian fighters attacking them. Onboard, Han and Leia were finally able to reunite with their friends and family. They also encountered the smuggler Uran Lavint, who informed them of Alema's existence on the ship and the conference being held on [[Gilatter VIII]]. Unknown to them, Alema had been looking for Han to kill him and make Leia suffer. He and Leia later went to Gilatter VIII to rescue Jacen from a [[Confederation]] ambush. However, Jacen fled the planet, leaving them behind to deal with Alema and the Confederation.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nUnbeknownst to Han and Leia, Jacen initially decided to make them his sacrifice for his ascension to Sith Lord; however, he later killed Mara Jade Skywalker instead. Han, along with Leia, also went to Hapes to comfort Luke in his grief in the loss of his wife.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice]]''</ref>\n\nThen, Han and his wife slipped into Coruscant, as Leia was scheduled to deliver the eulogy for Mara. However, Jacen sent a squad of GAG troopers to intercept them. Naturally, Han and Leia refused to be arrested peacefully and escaped after a short firefight in the halls of the Temple, ditching their plans to attend the [[Funeral of Mara Jade Skywalker]].<ref name=\"Inferno\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''</ref>\n\nInstead, Han and Leia went to Kashyyyk to persuade the Wookiees not to join the Galactic Alliance. However, they encountered some difficulties in the form of old Wookiee grudges and two GA Intelligence agents, Tarfang and Jae Juun. Thankfully, Luke and the other Jedi arrived after making their final break with Jacen, and Jaina also arrived on the Wookiee homeworld. Angered by the betrayal of the Jedi, Jacen followed Luke in the ''Anakin Solo'' and brought the Fifth Fleet with him. After the Wookiees refused to yield the Jedi and the Solos up to Jacen, Jacen [[Battle of Kashyyyk (Second Galactic Civil War)|bombarded]] the planet's wroshyr forests, causing further outrage to Han, who was prepared to take the ''Millennium Falcon'' up to attack the ''Anakin Solo'' himself. He was talked out of it by Luke, who along with the other Jedi led a StealthX strike on the GA fleet. Luke allowed others to believe that he had been shot down by his niece Jaina while she was trying to hit Jacen's StealthX, and boarded the ship to confront his nephew and rescue his son.\n\nWhile Han and Leia were traveling to Hapes, Leia felt Luke's presence disappear and believed he was dead, but Han refused to believe it, thinking that it would take a change in the laws of physics to kill Luke Skywalker. When they got to Hapes, they convinced [[Queen Mother]] [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]] to stop supporting Jacen Solo.<ref name=\"Inferno\" /> Han and Leia were relieved when they returned to Kashyyyk and found Luke still alive.\n\nLater, Han and Leia sanctioned Confederacy assassination attempts on Jacen while planning their own justice with the Jedi for their son.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\nHan later accompanied Jaina, Zekk, and Jagged on their quest to end Alema Rar. He used the ''Falcon'' to rescue them from the asteroid they found Alema in after she had been killed.\n\n====Betrayal====\nHan was later part of the strike team that boarded the ''Anakin Solo'' to rescue [[Allana Djo Solo|Allana]] from Jacen. After the successful rescue, Han and Leia learned from Allana that Jacen was her father. The discovery that he was a grandfather came as a pleasant surprise to Han.\n\nHan was also present on Endor when Ben showed his family a recording that proved Jacen killed [[Mara Jade Skywalker]]. Han was shocked by the discovery.\n\nFollowing Jaina's training under Boba Fett, she revealed to Han and Leia that she had to be the one to kill Jacen, now known as Darth Caedus. Jaina embarked on a mission, dueling Caedus first on [[Nickel One]], and then encountering him on the ''Anakin Solo''. After a [[Battle of Uroro Station|duel]] and being mortally wounded, Caedus stopped fighting so he could warn Tenel Ka about a [[Nanovirus|threat]] to Allana. Jaina thought this to be a trick and killed him, horrified when she felt Jacen reaching out to Tenel Ka. Afterward she believed that Jacen had been himself at the end, though knowing that there was still too little of him to be saved. Han still believed that Caedus would have killed Jaina. Though the Solos struggled to get through this hard time, they were able to remember Jacen as the kind young man he had once been, not the Sith he had turned into. The war had ended, and though Han had lost much, peace was finally at hand. Additional comfort and joy came from Han's granddaughter, Allana, whom Tenel Ka had given to Han and Leia to raise under the pseudonym Amelia because she knew that they could give the girl a safer life than she could on Hapes.\n\n===Post-Second Galactic Civil War (43 ABY&ndash;)===\n====Origins of the ''Millennium Falcon''====\nHan and his wife were able to come to some terms with losing their other son and they busied themselves by taking care of their granddaughter, given the name \"Amelia\" to hide her identity. While on an outing in the Falcon with Leia and Allana, the young girl found a camouflaged transponder aboard the ''Falcon''. It had been placed there more than half a century before by the [[Republic Group/Legends|Republic Group]], an organization that tried and failed to keep the Republic together and honorable in its waning years. It was meant to find its way to the planet of Toprawa, but a collision with [[Jendirian Valley III|another craft]] had made this impossible. Because Han and Leia had been telling Allana about how Han had acquired the ''Falon'', she thought that they could track down all the people who had owned the ship, finding out what the mysterious component was along the way. Her grandparents agreed.<ref name=\"MF\" />\n\nThey traveled to the planet of [[Lujo]] to visit Lando Calrissian and his family at on of their homes, where they stayed for a few weeks. Han asked Calrissian who he had won the ''Falcon'' from and Calrissian pointed him to [[Cix Trouvee]]. Additionally, one of Calrissian's technicians, [[Tal-lik-Tal]], examined the transponder and found that it was comparable to pre-Imperial designs and still active.<ref name=\"MF\" />\n\n====Lost Tribe of Sith emergence====\n{{Quote|To think I originally chose a military career.''\"<br />\"''You had a military career.

This eventually resulted in the arrest of Luke, though after an agreement between Skywalker and Daala, Luke exiled himself from the Jedi Order and subsequently began a quest to learn what had lead to Jacen's fall to the dark side. The Solos were soon contacted by Lando and were forced to aid him in saving the planet of Kessel which had succumbed to violent earthquakes at the time Centerpoint Station was destroyed. The Solos discovered a strange species of pure energy based beings living within Kessel, who monitored every gravity well in the galaxy, and who had begun to leave en masse, causing the earthquakes that wreaked across Kessel. Ultimately, however, the Solos and their allies proved able to save Kessel from destruction.<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> Later, Han and Leia traveled to Dathomir, as Luke had tracked a [[Lost Tribe of Sith|Sith]] girl there. Solo had several adventures on the world, such as an attack by [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsisters]]. Han and Leia then returned to Coruscant, and Han was newly appointed as a general.<ref name=\"Backlash\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]''</ref> Solo later participated in the [[Plan Delta|coup]] that removed Natasi Daala as Chief of State and placed the Jedi in charge of the government, and then he traveled with Leia and Allana to the planet [[Klatooine/Legends|Klatooine]] in order to end a slave [[Liberation|rebellion]] there.<ref name=\"Conviction\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Smart barve, your dad. No wonder he's so hard to kill.|Boba Fett, to Jaina Solo|<ref name=\"Legacy of the Force: Invincible\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:HanSoloPromo-MOSW.png|thumb|right|200px|Han was known for his fast draw.]]\nHan Solo was known for his cockiness, dry wit, rudeness, piloting skills, and his fast draw. He also had an affinity for Sabacc and other gambling games. He often boasted of his achievements he made in his ship the ''Millennium Falcon'', such as making the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, and being able to outrun Imperial Star Destroyers. Captain Solo was quite the [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]], having made countless modifications to the ''Falcon'' alongside Chewie. He once said he preferred to shoot first as opposed to shooting second, and used to his advantage on at least one occasion the fact that he was ambidextrous. Han Solo was also one of the few people to evade Boba Fett on multiple occasions. During the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], when he began to distrust the New Jedi Order because of his beliefs that Corellia should be able to have independence, Leia often referred to him as \"the most dangerous man in the galaxy\".\n\nHan was not known to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], unlike his wife, children and many of his friends, although due to his experience with the Force via his friends and family, he was Force-attuned. Despite his family and frequent companions including some of the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy, Han was far from helpless in comparison. His ability to think up inventive and often extremely unorthodox solutions to problems on the fly proved to be a constant source of frustration to all enemies he encountered (and often his friends). This, combined with Han's peerless skill at the hands of the ''Millennium Falcon'' as well as the legendary \"Solo Luck\" more than compensated for any lack of Force sensitivity. During his daughter Jaina's wedding, however, Jaina speculated that he may have potentially possessed a mild form of Force-sensitivity.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse]]''</ref>\n\nHe was, however, a man with insecurities as well. He was overprotective of his ship and hated times when the ''Falcon'' was modified or repaired too much, especially by droids, as tight bolts on the craft wouldn't let him feel how hard they were hit by laser fire, resulting in him loosening several of them around the ship. He was also hesitant to let Chewbacca, Lando or anyone else fly it. Han also vowed jokingly to never give the codes for the ''Falcon'' to his son Jacen, at least not in his lifetime.<ref name=\"BefSt\" />\n\nAmong the multiple skills he developed during his early career, Han Solo became familiar with the practice and details of dishwashing.<ref name=\"CotJ\" />\n\nHan Solo was known to dislike droids and discouraged them from travelling in his ship, although he relented in certain circumstances. After he joined the Rebellion, he allowed C-3PO and R2-D2 free access to the ''Falcon,'' as a special case and in attention to Luke Skywalker's and Leia Organa's wishes; Solo nevertheless rarely had a good word to any of the droids.<ref name=\"HE\" />\n\nHe had a particular distaste for \"bugs\", as he revealed during the Swarm War, probably due to the run-in with Kamarian religious fanatics early in his smuggling career. Han also had a loud snore which bothered Leia.<ref name=\"BefSt\" />\n\nIn addition to speaking his native [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], Solo fluently understood many other [[Language/Legends|languages]], including [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]], [[Trader's argot]]<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> [[Rodese/Legends|Rodese]],<ref name=\"A New Hope\" /> [[Illodian Sibilant|Illodian]],<ref name=\"TyrT\" /> and [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" /> He could also imperfectly speak [[Mandaba/Legends|Mandaba]], the Selonian language.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\">''[[Assault at Selonia]]''</ref> Although he spoke Basic with a Corellian accent for much of his life, he had developed more of a [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]] accent by 40 ABY.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n==Romances==\nDuring his life, Han Solo had several romances.\n\n===Bria Tharen===\n[[File:TheParadiseSnare-CoverArt.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Han and Bria leave [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]]]]\nHis first ''serious'' relationship occurred during the time Han was working for Besadii on Ylesia. Known to him only as \"Pilgrim 921\", Bria Tharen immediately attracted Han's attention thanks to her facial features and Corellian accent, even as she was processing glitterstim in the complete dark. Together they fled Ylesian \"paradise\" and made their way to Bria's home on Corellia and the couple eventually traveled to Coruscant, where Han planned to apply to the Imperial Academy. It was there when Bria left Han to confront her addiction to the Exultation after she helped her lover to obtain the money for \"buying the new personality\". This relationship haunted Han for a very long time and forced him to make a decision not to fall in love again.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nThey would eventually meet again during the Rebel raid on Ylesia. Unfortunately, it turned out that Bria was using Han and other smugglers for the Rebel gains. Even after this incident, Han would later feel sorry for her and sadly pass on the message about Bria's death to her family.<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" />\n\n===Xaverri===\nHis \"second\" relationship five years after his breaking up with Bria Tharen was with traveling magician and illusionist named Xaverri. They met after her performance on Nar Shaddaa, started going out and on their fourth date, Xaverri revealed her past to Han, who in turn shared his own background and troubles with the Empire. She also told Solo that this was the first tour where she hadn't spent her spare time plotting against the Empire. Han offered his services as an assistant for her show and a pilot, and she agreed. Shortly after, Xaverri and Han deepened their relationship to an intimate level. Feeling that being around Han and Chewbacca had made her too soft, too vulnerable, and too attached to him, she left him after several months.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" />\n\nThey would later team up during the Battle of Nar Shaddaa<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> and eventually after many years on Crseih Station. Han would later reflect that he might have had a future with her if she hadn't left him.<ref name=\"TCS\" />\n\n===Salla Zend===\nBeing his fellow smuggler, Salla Zend \"replaced\" a position of Han's girlfriend after his unsuccessful romance with Xaverri.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> In time, the initially harsh woman became more attached to Han. Not feeling the same way, he was forced to virtually \"escape\" from her.<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" />\n\nShe never forgot his actions and upon meeting again during the resurrected Emperor crisis reminded him of what he had done.<ref name=\"DE1\" />\n\n===Katya M'Buele===\nAt some point in his smuggling career, Han Solo partnered with Katya M'Buele, with whom he infiltrated the restricted world of Skye. They were the sole survivors of that unfortunate smuggling operation. Solo met M'Buele again two years after the Battle of Yavin, but Katya was killed shortly thereafter by a [[Smoke Demon]] under the control of Majestrix Kharys of Skye.<ref name=\"The Long Hunt\" />\n\n===Leia Organa===\n[[File:Star-wars-trilogy-28.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Han Solo kisses Leia Organa.]]\n{{Quote|Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.|Han Solo|<ref name=\"A New Hope\" />}}\nHan first spotted her when she was just a little princess on a lap of Viceroy Organa, whose prerecorded message welcomed all ships arriving on Alderaan.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> After ten years, when they actually first met, the two got off to a rocky start; however, as they worked together during the Galactic Civil War, Leia and Han developed a relationship that would last throughout the war. Their love fully manifested shortly before Han's capture by Boba Fett. Despite Leia's later occasional suitors like [[Fenn Shysa]] or Prince Isolder, Han never lost his \"femme fatale\" from sight.\n\nIn [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], the two were married and had three children, Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo, in the next two years. Even with the death of their youngest child Anakin and estrangement and death of Jacen in [[41 ABY]], their relationship grew stronger. By the time of [[43 ABY]], having been married for more than thirty-five years, they loved each other even more than they did in 8 ABY.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n===Origins and development===\n{{Quote|You old stardog.

Solo's character had been frozen in carbonite during the climax of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and Ford was a rising star in Hollywood following his starring role as [[Indiana Jones]] in [[1981]]'s [[Wikipedia:Raiders of the Lost Ark|''Raiders of the Lost Ark'']]. Ford himself thought that Solo should die in ''Jedi'', sacrificing himself to save Skywalker and Princess Leia. He reasoned that Solo had no family, future, or responsibilities to the story,<ref name=\"dreams\" /> and that his death would give the story some resonance.<ref name=\"q&a\" /> Kasdan also believed that a major character death early in ''Jedi'' would keep audiences worried, believing that none of the characters were safe. Lucas vetoed the idea, however, and Solo ultimately survived.<ref name=\"dreams\" />\n\nThe script of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' originally called for Solo to respond to Princess Leia's declaration of \"I love you\" with \"I love you too\". Ford disliked the line, feeling that the established character of Solo wasn't being taken advantage of. After many takes, director [[Irvin Kershner]] wasn't satisfied either. He told Ford not to think about it, and to say whatever he thought that Solo would say. When Ford improvised the line \"I know\", Kirshner felt that it was perfect for the character, and it was included in the film's final cut.<ref name=\"dreams\" />\n\nSolo was voiced by [[Perry King]] in the trilogy's three radio dramas,<ref name=\"DB\" /> and by various voice actors in different ''Star Wars'' [[video game]]s: [[Neil Ross]] in [[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (video game)|''Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'']], ''[[Star Wars: Masters of Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Force Commander]]'', [[David Esch]] in ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'', [[Lex Lang]] in ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'', and [[John Armstrong]] in ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'' and [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']].<ref name=\"galaxies\">{{GalaxiesAED}}</ref> [[James Gaulke]] leant his vocal talents for the [[Dark Forces: Jedi Knight (audio drama)|''Dark Forces: Jedi Knight'' audio drama]],<ref name=\"audiodrama\">[[Dark Forces: Jedi Knight (audio drama)|''Dark Forces: Jedi Knight'' audio drama]]</ref> and [[Joe Hacker]] for the audio adaptations of [[Dark Empire (audio drama)|''Dark Empire'']], [[Dark Empire II (audio drama)|''Dark Empire II'']] and [[Empire's End (audio drama)|''Empire's End'']].<ref name=\"deaudio\">[[Dark Empire (audio drama)|''Dark Empire'' audio drama]]</ref><ref name=\"deiiaudio\">[[Dark Empire II (audio drama)|''Dark Empire II'' audio drama]]</ref><ref name=\"eeaudio\">[[Empire's End (audio drama)|''Empire's End'' audio drama]]</ref>\n\n===In ''Star Wars'' media===\n{{Quote|Writing the Han Solo novels was quite good for my writing career.|A.

One such story is \"[[Into the Great Unknown]],\" a short comic which appeared in [[2003]]'s [[Star Wars Tales 19|''Star Wars Tales'' 19]].

Emperor Palpatine presides over the case as Solo argues the events of the ''Star Wars'' Special Edition and Greedo's mother claims the validity of the original version of the film. When she calls in [[Lak Sivrak/Legends|Lak Sivrak]], an alien who was removed from the cantina scene in the Special Edition, Solo questions his testimony by claiming that he wasn't actually present. Palpatine rules against Solo and sentences him to life imprisonment in carbonite.<ref name=\"court\" /> Solo also appears in the video game ''[[LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]''.<ref name=\"lego\">''[[LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]''</ref>\n\nFrom [[2001]] to [[2004]], Dark Horse Comics published [[Star Wars Infinities|alternate takes]] on the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, with each tale altering one pivotal moment in the film and exploring the hypothetical consequences. In ''[[Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope]]'', Luke Skywalker's proton torpedoes detonate prematurely and fail to destroy the Death Star. Yavin 4 is destroyed by the battle station's superlaser, and the ''Millennium Falcon'' and Luke's X-wing flee through the debris field as Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader capture the escaping Rebel fleet.<ref name=\"anhinfin1\">[[Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope 1|''Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope'' 1]]</ref> After rendezvousing in another system, Skywalker and R2-D2 abandon their battered X-wing and board the ''Falcon''. When Solo tells Skywalker that the Rebellion is over, he is attacked by the emotionally heated youngster. Skywalker only stays his lightsaber blade when the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi appears and tells him to go to Dagobah. Solo gives Skywalker a ride on the ''Falcon'', and lands the ship in the planet's swamps without incident. Yoda appears and brings the group to his hut, where Solo alone realizes that the small green being is Yoda himself. He shares his discovery with his impatient companion, who goes on to train in the Jedi arts under Yoda while Solo and Chewbacca remain on the planet and tinker with the ''Falcon''. After two months, the pair of smugglers depart the planet, promising to come back if Skywalker ever needs a lift.<ref name=\"anhinfin2\">[[Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope 2|''Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope'' 2]]</ref>\n\nFive years later, Solo and Chewbacca are at a cantina on Ord Mantell, and see a holovid of Princess Leia, now a servant of Darth Vader, addressing the citizens of the Empire from Coruscant. Infuriated, Solo breaks his chair over his table, and draws the attention of bounty hunters and Imperial stormtroopers. He and Chewie manage to reach the ''Falcon'', and dodge an orbiting Imperial fleet en route to Dagobah. After once again arriving on the swamp world, Solo makes his way into the dark side cave as Skywalker is performing the final test of his Jedi training. He and Chewbacca then join Skywalker, Yoda, and R2-D2 for dinner, and inform Skywalker that Leia is alive. Yoda then reveals that Skywalker is the son of Vader and the sister of Leia, and the entire group prepares to depart for Coruscant.<ref name=\"anhinfin3\">[[Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope 3|''Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope'' 3]]</ref>\n\nAfter arriving at the Imperial throneworld, Solo drops Yoda and R2-D2 off on the ''Death Star'', and leaves with the aid of a mind trick by Yoda. He and Skywalker then land onworld while Chewbacca keeps the ''Falcon'' airborne, and storm the Imperial Palace. As Leia wants them to find her, the only resistance they encounter is four Royal Guards armed with double-bladed lightsabers. Solo and Skywalker fight them off, and Solo strikes the final blow by seizing one of the lightsabers and stabbing a guard in the back. C-3PO then arrives and escorts them to Leia's throne room, where she awaits with Vader and the Emperor. Reprogrammed to serve the Empire, the protocol droid places a blaster to Solo's head and forces him to watch Skywalker duel his sister. Skywalker redeems Leia, and the Emperor begins casting Force lightning against them both before Vader turns on his master. Skywalker incapacitates C-3PO but forces Han to carry the droid, and the group cuts their way through stormtroopers before boarding the ''Falcon'' and fleeing the planet as Yoda crashes the ''Death Star'' into the Emperor's Palace. Many years later, the group attends a ceremony electing Leia as Chancellor of the New Republic.<ref name=\"anhinfin4\">[[Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope 4|''Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope'' 4]]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back]]'', when Solo finds Skywalker in a Hoth snowstorm, Skywalker dies in his arms, having been attacked by an additional Wampa in the cave. Skywalker's dying words tell Solo to go to Dagobah to train as a Jedi. The Empire catches the Rebels unaware during Skywalker's funeral, and Solo and Chewbacca take Princess Leia and the droids on the ''Falcon'' during the melee. Rather than fly into an asteroid field, they attach themselves to a Star Destroyer right away, and float away with the garbage to go to Cloud City and get their hyperdrive repaired. Lando Calrissian receives them, and discovers that Boba Fett followed them and arrived at the same time.<ref name=\"esbinfin1\">[[Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 1|''Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back'' 1]]</ref> Solo and Chewbacca team up with Calrissian's forces to incapacitate Fett, and the bounty hunter is frozen in carbonite. With a repaired hyperdrive, Solo and his crew leave the planet to go to Dagobah.<ref name=\"esbinfin2\" />\n\nOn Dagobah, they come across Yoda, and Solo demands to be trained as a Jedi. When Yoda informs him that Skywalker's message was actually meant for Leia, he reluctantly departs, letting Leia begin her Jedi training.<ref name=\"esbinfin1\" /> Solo and Chewbacca spend the next three months saving up enough credits to pay back Jabba the Hutt, and contact the smuggler [[Vilmarh Grahrk]] to deliver the funds from Mos Eisley. Grahrk betrays them to a team of Gand bounty hunters and takes their ship, and Solo, Chewbacca, and the droids are brought to Jabba's Palace. Solo and Chewbacca are thrown into a pit of [[Nexu/Legends|Nexu]], but are rescued when R2-D2 opens the pit door. Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2 escape while the Nexu overrun the Palace,<ref name=\"esbinfin3\">[[Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 3|''Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back'' 3]]</ref> and return to Dagobah to see if Leia has completed her training. When they find her dueling Darth Vader, Solo and Chewbacca fire their blasters at his face, killing him. Yoda passes away and becomes one with the Force, and during Vader's funeral pyre, the surviving group declares that they have a galaxy to save.<ref name=\"esbinfin4\">[[Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 4|''Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back'' 4]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Blindhan.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A blind Solo mans the ''Falcon''{{'s}} guns during the Battle of Endor.]]\nFinally, ''[[Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi]]'' sees Solo not released from carbonite until well after the events of Jabba's Palace.<ref name=\"rotjinfin3\">[[Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi 3|''Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi'' 3]]</ref> When the Hutt beheads C-3PO during negotiations with Leia in her bounty hunter disguise, Leia is left without a translator, and removes her helmet, causing a scene that ends with her thermal detonator activating and slipping from her fingers. She, Chewbacca, and Calrissian are able to escape as the Palace explodes, but fail to catch Boba Fett, who brings Solo aboard the ''Slave I'' and flees Tatooine. While pursuing him through the palace, Leia accidentally fires on Solo's frozen form. After rendezvousing with Skywalker and R2-D2,<ref name=\"rotjinfin1\">[[Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi 1|''Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi'' 1]]</ref> they begin searching for Fett, eventually locating him in the Outer Rim.

When a message arrives from Skywalker indicating that he has been captured by the Empire, Leia takes the ''Slave I'' to Endor to rescue him, and Solo joins Calrissian and Chewbacca on the ''Falcon'' as the Rebel Fleet follows her and strikes at the Death Star.<ref name=\"rotjinfin3\" /> Calrissian takes the ''Falcon'' to the moon's surface, and when Chewbacca is injured by pursuing TIE fighters, Solo mans the guns, firing blindly as Calrissian aims them at the shield generator. Rebel ground forces have already weakened the generator, and Solo's blasts finish the job. The ''Falcon'' then boards the Death Star to recover Skywalker, Leia, and a redeemed Darth Vader. After the station is destroyed, Vader joins the Rebel Fleet and efforts are begun to track down the Emperor, Han now wearing a helmet that is apparently intended to compensate for his lost eyesight.<ref name=\"rotjinfin4\">[[Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi 4|''Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi'' 4]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Quote-audio.png|30px|(audio)]]\n[[Media:Han.ogg|Hear Han Solo]]\n\nHan Solo and Chewbacca appeared in the ambiguously canon scenario for [[Star Wars Miniatures]], [[The Theft of Vader's Helmet]], in which they [[Infiltration of the Executor|infiltrate the ''Executor'']] to steal Darth Vader's [[Darth Vader's armor/Legends|helmet]] sometimes during Admiral [[Firmus Piett/Legends|Piett's]] captaincy of the ''Executor''.<ref name=\"The Theft of Vader's Helmet\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=swminis/article/vadershelmet|text=The Theft of Vader's Helmet|int=The Theft of Vader's Helmet}}</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of Endor DLC for ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]'', Darth Vader sends the [[Dark Apprentice]] to stop the rebels from destroying the shield generator bunker protecting the second Death Star. As the Dark Apprentice approached the bunker, Han Solo told Chewbacca they must buy time for Princess Leia to set the bombs to destroy the bunker. Chewbacca engaged the Dark Apprentice with a stolen [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST]] while Han took shots at him with a rocket launcher. Despite assistance from the Ewoks, they were unable to defeat him. The Dark Apprentice heavily damaged the walker, then incapacitated Chewbacca and lifted him into the air with one hand. Han attempted to save his friend by firing two shots from his blaster, only for the Dark Apprentice to use Chewbacca as a shield, killing him much to Han's horror. Enraged, Han opened fire with his blaster, but the Dark Apprentice easily deflected the shots with his lightsaber, then lifted him into the air with the Force and impaled him, killing Han. As a result of Han and Chewbacca's failure, the Dark Apprentice was able to destroy the bombs and kill Leia, resulting in the Empire's victory over the Rebel Alliance.\n\nOn [[July 22]] [[2011]], Han made an appearance in ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace]]'' as a young boy who escapes an orphanage and ends up joining Yoda in a quest to recover stolen battle plans from the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].\n\n==Translations==\n*In the Italian version of the [[original trilogy]], Han is called '''Ian Solo''' or (in the subtitles) '''Jan

Born on Corellia, he was orphaned at an early age and taken by the pirate Garris Shrike to serve on his crew. He was treated cruelly, and served Shrike for many years before escaping while in his teens. Solo became a smuggler, and fell in love with Bria Tharen, though she left him due to her duties to the Rebel Alliance. Solo then entered the Imperial Academy at Carida, serving with distinction. He was kicked out, however, when he stopped an Imperial officer from beating a Wookiee named Chewbacca with a neuronic whip for resisting capture. In gratitude, the Wookiee swore a life debt to Solo, protecting him with his life and a bond of friendship formed between the two that was unbreakable. Solo became a smuggler once again, with Chewbacca at his side. Piloting the upgraded and customized Millennium Falcon, which he won in a game of Sabacc against Lando Calrissian, his future ally, he became known as one of the best smugglers in the galaxy.\nOn the run from Imperial officials, Solo became caught up with the Rebel Alliance, courtesy of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia Organa, whom he helped rescue from the Death Star. Solo helped Skywalker destroy the Death Star when it attacked the Rebel base at Yavin 4, where they had taken Organa. Solo became an unofficial member of the Rebel Alliance, and fell in love with Organa. He officially joined the Alliance in 4 ABY and was immediately commissioned as a general. He led the strike team that helped destroy the Second Death Star at the Battle of Endor, in which Emperor Palpatine was killed. A year later, the New Republic was founded.\nSolo married Organa in 8 ABY, and the two had three children: Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin. As the New Republic was threatened by many enemies in its first years of existence, Solo was always on the move, sometimes traveling with Skywalker, who was Organas brother. Along with his wife and faithful Wookiee friend, Solo fought against Warlord Zsinj, Grand Admiral Thrawn, the reborn Emperor Palpatine, Admiral Daala and the Yevetha. In 25 ABY the New Republic was attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong. The war that followed lasted four years and was extremely bloody. Solos closest friend Chewbacca and his son Anakin Solo both died during the war, deaths that haunted the ex-smuggler. The Vong were eventually defeated and the New Republic was reformed into the Galactic Alliance. In 40 ABY, his son Jacen turned to the dark side of the Force, and took control of the Galactic Alliance. Solo and his wife joined the rebel faction opposing Darth Caedus, and the two were prepared to kill him, as they no longer saw him as their son. At the end of the war, Solo was still having tense relations with the GA government.\n\n\u2022 Biography\n\n\u2022 Early life\n\n\u2022 Childhood\n\nAmbush at Corellia\nThere were many rumors and speculation as to what happened to Han Solo in his earlier years. He was the subject of several holofilms, documentaries and at least two supposed \"autobiographies\" whose true authorship was questionable. For example, one contested account said that Solo was raised by Wookiees from age seven to twelve after his parents left him.\n.]]\nIn reality, Han Solo was orphaned at an early age, and his earliest memories were of being found in a Corellian spaceport by Garris Shrike with no clear memory of his life beforehand. Shrike took Solo in as a member of his band of vagabonds, training and using him in his underhanded enterprises. First, Han was sent out as a beggar, using his young appearance to get handouts. When he was older, Han learned how to pickpocket by first practicing on a droid of Shrikes, and then being sent out into the streets. During this time, Solo was befriended by Dewlanna, a Wookiee who was serving as a cook aboard Traders Luck, Shrike's ship.\nDewlanna raised Solo as her own son, teaching him Shyriiwook and taking care of him when he became ill. Han would go on to participate in numerous scams and illegal activities under Shrikes direction, including participating in an asteroid mining scam and swoop racing.The Paradise Snare'\nThough Solo wanted to learn more about his family, especially his parents, Shrike kept all that information from him in order to better keep him under his control. For years, he did not even know his family name. At one point, soon after learning from Dewlanna that he was part of the famous Solo line, he ran away from Shrike on Corellia. There, he tracked down his long lost aunt Tiion Solo and his cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo. The reunion with his family went badly, however&mdash;his aunt was a housebound madwoman while his cousin was a sadistic bully who eventually sold him out to Shrike.\nHan did not learn about his parents, Jonash and Jaina Solo, until he reached adulthood. Solo hid the fact that he was descended from Berethron e Solo, a king of Corellia who introduced democracy to the system.\n\n\u2022 Adventures with Shrike\n\nGarris Shrike\nHan Solo visited many planets on the behest of Shrike. During a mission on Corellia, Han befriended the half-breed Bey, an individual he would later encounter during the Nagai Invasion, shortly after the Battle of Endor. There are also scattered reports that claim Han Solo was present on Kashyyyk during the battle there, near the tail-end of the Clone Wars. Similar reports have been made about a brief run-in with bounty hunters searching for an escaped Jedi on the planet Socorro.Ghost (comic story)\n.]]\nSolos education was spotty, like those of the other children Shrike used as beggars and thieves. Though most of the children received only an elementary education from the ships computer on Trader's Luck, he managed with Dewlanna's help to pick up some knowledge of mathematics, physics, and history by reading in his spare time. Intermittently, he would attend school while going undercover as part of a \"respectable family\" while Shrike was running a complicated con. At one point, Solo briefly attended a school where Garm Bel Iblis gave a speech. Afterward, he asked the Senator two insightful questions, which impressed Bel Iblis. Years later, during the Thrawn campaign (9 ABY), the senator would still recall meeting Solo.\nSolo earned his keep for Shrike doing a variety of unsavory jobs. He once joined a pirate group operated by cutthroats Lemo and Sanda. He made a name for himself racing repulsorlift swoops professionally and on the independent circuit. In these days, Solo made an enemy out of a Corellian swoop jockey named Dengar. During one highly publicized race through the crystal swamps of Agrilat, Solo caused Dengar to crash headfirst into a crystalline plant, severely crippling the other racer. Dengar, who would hold a grudge against Solo for the rest of his life, would later become a bounty hunter contracted to find him.\nIn 12 BBY, Solo was sentenced to fight in the Regional Sector Number Four's All-Human Free-For-All on the penal-colony world of Jubilar for cheating at cards, a felony there. Matched against three other human fighters much larger than himself, Solo somehow managed to defeat the other gladiators in unarmed combat, suffering numerous broken bones. Just prior to the onset of the fight, Solo caught a glimpse of a mysterious figure wearing Mandalorian armor, his first encounter, albeit indirect, with the notorious Boba Fett.\nIn 10 BBY, Solo was ready to leave Trader's Luck in order to start his own career. He made plans to stowaway aboard Ylesian Dream, an automated freighter, and go to Ylesia, where he would apply for a job opening advertised by the Ylesian high priests. When Solo was about to leave, Shrike and a few of his cohorts caught him as he was saying goodbye to Dewlanna. The armed men tried to stop Solo, but Dewlanna sacrificed herself so that Solo could escape. Solo promised to himself that, if ever he had the chance, he would help one of Dewlanna's people to repay his debt to her.\n\n\u2022 Pre-military career\n\nHan Solo and the Lost Legacy'\nSolo stowed away aboard Ylesian Dream and after a difficult flight, he arrived on Ylesia. He applied for the piloting job under the alias Vykk Draygo; he was to pilot the Ylesian Dream&mdash;being a drone ship, it had been falling victim to pirate attacks. A Togorian by the name of Muuurgh was assigned to be Solos bodyguard, and, despite some initial tension due to the nature of the relationship, Solo and Muuurgh became fast friends. Solo also developed a relationship with one of the pilgrims who had come to Ylesia seeking religious sanctuary&mdash;a Human woman by the name of Bria Tharen. Solo remained in the High Priests employ for a time, but after discovering the true nature of the operation&mdash;a complete scam designed to lure Pilgrims into becoming slaves&mdash;he fled the planet with Tharen, Muuurgh, and Mrrov, Muuurghs wife-to-be. Also key in his flight was that Bria, who had also learned the truth about the Ylesian fraud, was to be married to Ganar Tos. In the process, Solo and Tharen stole a small cache of treasures from the High Priest Toroenzas treasure room and indirectly killed Zavval, the Hutt administrator of Ylesia. This would come back to haunt him later in his life as many bounty hunters would be after him due to the bounty placed on his head by Zavval's relatives.\nSolo and Tharen eventually made their way to Coruscant so that Solo could fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot in the Imperial Navy. There, Han received a referral from Tharens father, Renn, to the Imperial Academy, qualifying him for the entrance examinations without a credential from a Sector Naval Academy.The Essential Guide to Warfare Han also had his identity completely changed, including new retinal patterns by Nici the Specialist. They remained together for a short time, but in the end Tharen left Solo without warning because she felt that she was holding him back. She felt that her struggles with the addictive \"Exultation\" of the Ylesian tlanda Til would hinder Han's career.\nSolo took the entrance exams for the Imperial Academy on Coruscant, doing poorly on the cultural portions and advanced mathematics, but excelling in technical knowledge and the piloting tests. During the test, Solo flew through the Arch of Triumph rather than taking the parade route above it, thus earning the fastest time for an assigned flight run. Despite his unorthodox conduct, Solo was accepted into the Academy and assigned to a two-year program of flight instruction on Carida.\nJust after he was accepted into the Academy of Carida, Solo was attacked by Garris Shrike, who was one of the few people who knew that Vyyk Draygo and Han Solo were the same person. Han was certain to have been doomed to Hutt retribution, but another bounty hunter killed Shrike and Han was able to kill that hunter. The next day he shipped out to Carida.\n\n\u2022 Service in the Imperial Starfleet\n\nX-Wing: Rogue Squadron\nSolo was crushed at Bria Tharens departure, but he followed his dreams (and Tharens wishes) and went to study at the Academy of Carida. There he would hone his skills as a pilot. Among his fellow students were future TIE Fighter ace Soontir Fel and Solos friend Mako Spince.The Hutt Gambit At flight school, Solos record was mixed: he earned excellent piloting marks, but his academic record was poor and he earned a number of demerits and conduct reports. His flight instructor, Alexsandr Badure, approved of him, filing a report praising Solos abilities when he managed to land a malfunctioning U-33 orbital loadlifter by executing a number of difficult flight maneuvers, saving the lives of numerous cadets and Academy Dean Horace Wyrmyr. Student Advisor Lucinta Cal-Meg noted Solos innate intelligence and that he worked hard to improve his academic performance. However, many also had deep reservations about Solos judgement, conduct, and suitability for military service, as well as his friends at the Academy. In Solos second year, he was investigated for his role in Mako Spinces prank that destroyed Caridas Mascot Moon with a gram of stolen antimatter, though Cadet Tedris Bjalin's testimony cleared Solo of any involvement.\nSolo graduated at the top of his class with the rank of lieutenant. However, his hard-earned military career was short lived. In 5 BBY, he was dispatched to aid Commander Nyklas in duties including slaving and construction work. In this capacity, Han boarded a derelict slaving craft to find that its cargo of Wookiee children had escaped and that a badly wounded Wookiee was in the pilots seat. Nyklas ordered Han to skin the helpless Chewbacca, but Han refused and Nyklas swore to punish the Corellian. Shortly afterward, Han and Chewbacca were put to work on the construction of a new wing of the Imperial Hall of Heroes on Coruscant by Wookiee slaves. An enraged Chewbacca turned on Nyklas, who drew his blaster on the Wookiee. Solo refused to let Chewbacca die; he stunned his commanding officer and helped Chewbacca escape, with the assistance of the Rebel Alliance. Court-martialed and dishonorably discharged which also resulted in loss of his pension and back-pay. Worst of all, Han was blacklisted as a pilot making it next to impossible for him to find piloting with any legitimate company, as a result Solo returned to smuggling with Chewbacca (who had sworn a life debt to the Corellian) at his side.The endnotes of the Dark Empire' trade paperback claim that Han Solo was evicted from Imperial military service for a crime he did not commit.\nSolo later reflected that even without Chewbacca he probably would have left Imperial service anyway, due to the ridiculous regulations, incompetent officers and widespread anti-alien prejudice, and ever more frequent \u201cdemonstrations\u201d on dissident populations across the galaxy. He later became wanted for treason, with a bounty issued to his head by the Empire. --->\nSolo earned both classes of the Corellian Bloodstripe at some point during his military career, though the reasons for his first-class stripe are unknown. All that is known is that the events through which he earned them took place over several days. Because they were non-Imperial awards, they were the sole decorations that were not stripped from his uniform after his court-martial. Alexsandr Badure did later inform an interviewer that Solos second-class bloodstripes came from an incident dealing with a Wookiee.Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook'\n\n\u2022 Smuggling career\n\nHan Solo at Stars End\ncareer.]]\nInitially, Han was not happy to have the big Wookiee around. He had saved Chewbacca out of remembrance of Dewlanna, but it had cost him his life's dreams. Han spent much time drinking and playing sabacc, until he was accused of cheating by an irritated Barabel named Shallamar. He probably would have been seriously injured if Chewbacca had not stepped in. After that, Han and Chewbacca grew much closer beginning a loyal friendship and partnership that would endure for decades.\nSolos friend Mako Spince, who had been expelled from the Academy two years before graduation, helped Solo and Chewbacca get started as smugglers. Using Nar Shaddaa as their home base, the three of them enjoyed considerable success. Solo and Chewbacca also frequently worked for the Hutt Lords Jiliac and Jabba. They piloted many of their ships, including both Hutts personal yachts. Solo also befriended Lando Calrissian, a gambler who saved him from the notorious bounty hunter Boba Fett, and Jarik \"Solo\", a street urchin who claimed to be a long-lost relative. Han knew that Jariks claim was a lie, but he took the youth under his wing anyway. He also became romantically involved with the magician Xaverri and later fellow smuggler Salla Zend. During his time with Xaverri, Han became her stage assistant, and performed across the galaxies in her shows. He also served in the other part of her work&mdash;schemes designed to hurt the Empire and Imperial officials. At one point, Han even taught Lando how to fly in a ship that would be the center of much of Hans life-the Millennium Falcon. Han had been entranced by the ship from the moment he first saw it and he wanted it more than anything else. During that test run, his dangerous flying scared Calrissian. After that, he decided that Calrissian did not deserve a ship of that quality and contemplated having the Hutts buy it for him or even stealing it for himself.Millennium Falcon\nHan also bought his own ship, the Bria, from Lando, and restored it to spaceworthy condition with the help of Shug Ninx. Having the Bria only made him want the Millennium Falcon even more. When the Empire sent a fleet to raze the Smugglers Moon, Han and his friends rallied a force of smugglers and pirates to victory in the Battle of Nar Shaddaa. Shortly after the battle, as Han was paying the Imperial admiral that the Hutts had agreed to bribe in exchange for his battle plans, the Bria' was destroyed by Imperial fighters. Han and Chewbacca worked again with Mako, until he was crippled during a smuggling run in the Ottega system. Solo and Chewbacca continued their career on their own.\nShort on cash, Han pawned his last stolen treasure from Toroenzas cache and entered the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament. Against all odds he reached the tournament finals and beat his friend Lando, winning the Millennium Falcon with his earnings. For a time afterward Han Solo and Chewbacca worked in the Corporate Sector, the Tion Hegemony, and other remote but potentially lucrative sectors of the galaxy. Part of Solos motivation for these travels was a desire to get away from Salla Zend and her wedding plans, as he was not ready for such a commitment.Rebel Dawn Solo would later boast that he had been \"from one side of the galaxy to the other.\"\nHan and Chewbacca then met up with another of his former classmates from the academy, Jahan Cross, a Imperial Intelligence agent posing as a Imperial Diplo-serv Envoy on Etti IV. There they fought against some old \"friends\" of Han that lost a game of Sabacc to him. They were able to fight them off till the local security came and stopped the fight. Han and Chewbacca were then employed and given diplomatic immunity by Cross. Han then asked Cross what it would cost, with Cross telling him it will be at some point.Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 1 When Cross was framed for the murder of Dahlis Stark, Solo hid Stark in the secret compartments of the Falcon. Solo denied to Sergeant Myrsk that he had not seen Cross since the fight. Han was then punched by Myrsk, and then Chewbacca attacked him but Han was able to calm him down. Myrsk was then forced to apologize to Han or Chewbacca would hurt him. After Myrsk and his corporal left, Solo then told Cross to leave. Cross then asked Han for a blaster, a change of clothes, and to be taken to unfinished spa called Eclipse. Han at first refused, but Cross promised to pay him.Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 3 After Cross discovered suspicious activity on Eclipse, he hired Solo to fly him and Ellie Stark to the satellite. Upon reaching Reltooine, the Falcon was attacked by modified Vulture-class starfighter. Solo dropped off Stark and Cross, and flew off being chased by the starfighters. Solo managed to destroy the pursuing starfighters, and returned to pick up Cross and Stark from the falling space station. Solo transported Cross and Stark back to Etti IV and told Chewbacca how he was going spend the credits he had earned on a new gambling system to cheat at SabaccAgent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse' 5\nWhile in the Corporate Sector, the Falcon was damaged after Solo and Chewbacca attempted smuggling weapons to insurgents on Duroon. However, they did collect payment from the insurgents and went to pay off Ploovo Two-For-One, but in a rather creative manner. Given the prickly relationship and even outright disgust they had for each other, Han bought a foul, irritable, putrid dinko, attached the payment to it, and unleashed on the unfortunate employer. Although Corporate Sector Security arrived at the establishment where they were, Han and Chewbacca escaped their grasp relatively unscathed. Payment completed, they went off to find the outlaw tech \"Doc\" Vandangantes hideout, only to discover he had been taken to the Corporate Sector Authority prison at Stars End. Docs daughter Jessa offered upgrades and repairs to his ship, and a Corporate Sector waiver, in exchange for Han helping rescue Doc and other prisoners. Before he could take off, the outlaw techs were attacked by IRD-A Fighters. Piloting a Z-95 Headhunter, Han led the other techs and Jessa in defense of the base. Despite heavy losses, they were successful. To complete their rescue mission for Jessa, Solo and Chewbacca were given two droids, Bollux and Blue Max, and went to the agriworld Orron III to meet up with a group led by Rekkon planning the prison rescue. Though Solo was initially only interested in getting the repairs for his ship, his motives became personal when Chewbacca was captured. After dealing with a traitor in the group, Solo and the others arrived at Stars End. In order to gain entry, Han, Atuarre, Pakka, Bollux and Blue Max posed as a troupe of entertainers. The rescue proved successful; freeing Chewbacca, Doc, and the other prisoners and destroying the Stars End in the process. After the Falcon was repaired, Solo and Chewbacca left the Corporate Sector for a time, taking Bollux and Blue Max with them.\non a swoop bike.]]\nAfter a disastrous incident on Kamar, where Solo and Chewbacca accidentally began a religion (the Cult of Varn) before having to flee with their lives, they returned to the Corporate Sector. There, they were contracted to transport cargo from Lur. When they discovered the cargo was a group of Lurrian slaves, Solo freed the slaves and killed the slaver Zlarb. Since they had not been paid for their cargo run, Solo and Chewbacca decided to track down Zlarbs partner on Bonadan and get the promised ten thousand credits as revenge. While on Bonadan, Han was jumped and nearly overcome by a mysterious figure and Chewbacca encountered a skip tracer, Spray, trying to possess their ship for debts and regulation compliance. However, Han and Chewbacca became mixed up with a CSA Auditor, Hart-and-Parn Gorra-Fiolla, who was investigating the slavers also. Han went to meet an associate of hers, Magg, but he betrayed them. Forced to flee on a swoop bike, they made it off planet after a harrowing encounter and planned to meet up with Chewbacca on Ammuud. Chewbacca was also forced to make a somewhat hurried escape. While Han and Fiolla were on the transport that was taking them to meet Chewbacca, they were attacked by pirates, who were looking for them. They escaped in one of the pirates craft and landed at the nearby estates of the Mor Glayyd. Han and Chewbacca were eventually reunited after Han saved the Mor Glayyd from a duel which would have gotten him killed. The Glayyd estate provided Han with a way to get back to the Falcon and Chewbacca. As Han was leaving the planet, he was pursued by the pirates/slavers. However, at that point a CSA Victory-class Star Destroyer intervened and tractor beamed both ships. Though they helped her break up the gang, they barely escaped being arrested by another CSA executive, Odumin, who had really been the tracer Spray, and earned the enmity of a hired gun named Gallandro. They did, however, manage to steal the money Solo felt the CSA owed them.Han Solo's Revenge\nGiving up on the Corporate Sector, the Falcon crew attempted clothes legging in the Cron Drift and a currency exchange scam in the Lesser Plooriod Cluster before finding themselves short on cash and stuck in the Tion Hegemony. After several misadventures, they joined with Solos old friend Badure, a young woman named Hasti, and a Ruurian historian named S. V. Skynx on a hunt for Xim the Despots long-lost treasure ship, Queen of Ranroon. On Dellalt, they finally discovered the treasure vaults. After run-ins with the \"Survivors\" (the descendants of Xims soldiers) and their ancient war-robots, Solo finally discovered the vaults. Though Gallandro followed him to the vaults and challenged the smuggler to a duel, the automatic defense systems killed the gunfighter. Solo and his associates then recovered the treasure&mdash;unfortunately for them, after all those years it had become outdated war mat\u00e9riel. The two droids stayed with Skynx when Solo and Chewbacca left the Tion Hegemony.\nShortly after this, Han and Chewie were arrested by the Empire, the Millennium Falcon was impounded, and the two smugglers were put in solitary confinement on the Imperial prison barge Purge. When the crew of the Purge fell victim to a horrific bioweapon created by the Empire, Han and Chewie were let out of their cells by Zahara Cody, the ships doctor, in a bid for freedom from the virus. Han and Chewbacca managed to help Cody and a few others escape from the virus, then regained the Falcon and resumed their smuggling career.Death Troopers'\nStar Tours: The Adventures Continue\nAt some point between 2 BBY and 0 BBY, Han Solo ended up getting into a run-in with several Stormtroopers on the Star Tours space station. He then exchanged fire with them before escaping onboard the Millennium Falcon, also aiding a StarSpeeder 1000 carrying a Rebel agent in escaping as well. Solo's actions also resulted in a Star Destroyer suffering severe damage.\nIn 1 BBY, Solo was caught by Aleena gangster Sollima on the Outer Rim world of Simbarc with a debt he could not return. In exchange for the debt the gangster asked Solo to perform a dangerous mission for him. Sollimas accounting droid was being held by the Galactic Empire, who planned to use the information inside the droids data core to gain control over Sollimas casino world, the Hollow Moon. Since the Aleena was keeping Chewbacca as a hostage, Solo had no choice but to agree. Solos old friend, Billal Batross, with whom they grew up together on Traders Luck, joined him on the mission, as Batross also owed Sollima money he could not return.Star Wars Adventures: Han Solo and the Hollow Moon of Khorya\nhunted by Kharys on the restricted world of Skye.]]\nTogether, Solo and Batross infiltrated the Imperial garrison on Moog Mot VI and retrieved the droid, but Batross destroyed the droid with a blaster shot. He revealed that he was stealing money from Sollima accounts, and the droid discovered this, so Batross covered his tracks by selling the droid to the Empire. Shortly afterward, both partners were captured by Imperial forces and interrogated. They were informed that if they double-crossed Sollima, Captain Taavin would release them. Having no other choice but to agree, the accomplices returned the remains of the droid to the crime lord. Since Sollima needed the droid back intact, the Aleena ordered his bodyguards to shoot the scoundrels, but Batross managed to detonate a bomb hidden inside the droids head. In the ensuing chaos, Solo used the security key provided by Taavin to override the Hollow Moons defense system, allowing the Imperial Fleet safe passage in. Together, Batross, Solo and Chewbacca left the Hollow Moon in the Millennium Falcon. After their successful escape, Batross believed that he would become the third member of the team formed by Solo and Chewbacca, but they were tired of Batross getting them into trouble, and left him on Arbra amongst the Hoojibs.\nDuring this period, Solo and Chewbacca worked for Jabba the Hutt on occasion. They also had several run-ins with the Rebel Alliance. Senators Mon Mothma and Leia Organa became aware of Solo when he began to lead efforts to free Wookiee slaves from Kashyyyk, as a favor to Chewbacca, who had begun to lose friends and family members to the slaving effort. Solo reluctantly allowed the Alliance to help him in this effort, despite his disdain for political causes, and the Alliance soon became one of his frequent employers.\nAfter being saved from an Imperial fleet over Corellia, Han and Chewie helped plant an EMP charge on a shipment that was delivered to an Imperial facility over Corulag and helped steal Mon Calamari cruiser schematics on Carida. This last mission almost got them killed, and afterward Han swore off involvement with the Alliance and swore to keep his distance from the Galactic Civil War, until he was thrust into the center of galactic politics again after events on Tatooine.Star Wars: Empire at War\nAt some point in his smuggling career, he partnered with Katya MBuele as part of a Corellian rim-runners crew. They were the only survivors among the crew when a smuggling operation on Skye was discovered by the planets Imperial-assigned Majestrix, Kharys. Until they met again in 2 ABY, Solo stayed away from Skye, fearing Kharys would come after him.Star Wars Annual' (1977) 1\ntalks to Solo.]]\nSolos heaviest involvement with the fledgling Rebel Alliance occurred when he and other smugglers, including Lando Calrissian and Jarik Solo aided Bria Tharens Red Hand Squadron in raiding the Ylesian colonies and putting them out of business&mdash;a plan endorsed, aided, and supported by Jabba, a business rival of Ylesia. In the subsequent battle, the Alliance forces were victorious, but several smugglers, including Jarik Solo, were killed. Han and his smuggler friends were double-crossed by Tharen who seized all the spice and treasures that were to be the smugglers' reward for the Alliance.\nSoon afterward, he met with Tharen again during a Hutt-sponsored treasure hunt for the Yavin Vassilika. Once again, Tharen took the prize for the Rebellion, while Solo and his smuggling associates were left with nothing. Solo and Tharen left on poor terms on both occasions, since Solo refused to give up his independent ways and join Tharen in the Alliance. However, most of his fellow smugglers assumed that he had been working with Tharen from the beginning. Even one of his closest friends, Lando Calrissian, said that he never wanted to see him again.\n\n\u2022 Early Galactic Civil War\n\n\u2022 Working for Jabba\n\nHan Solo and Leia Organa\nHan continued to work for Jabba the Hutt as a smuggler, but once, while smuggling glitterstim, Han was boarded by an Imperial patrol and had to dump his load of spice&ndash;spice he couldnt recover. Still, as small consolation, Han and Chewbacca made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs after an attempt to recover the dumped spice turned nasty. As a warning, Jabba hired Greedo, a novice bounty hunter, to let Solo know that he was serious about getting paid. However, the Hutt lord was not renowned for patience, and none of Solos smuggler friends would help him. Solo was also dealt another personal blow at this time, when Boba Fett broke the news of Bria Tharen's death, at the Battle of Toprawa, to Solo.\nIn an attempt to find the funds to pay off Jabba, Han and Chewbacca were hired to transport an imprisoned crime lord, Tyber Zann off the prison world of Kessel. Though the deal did not transpire exactly as planned, much to Solo's annoyance, the duo transported Zann and his associate Urai Fen as agreed, though only after an increased fee.\n]]\nSince Han Solo still had not paid Jabba the Hutt, the crime lord sent Greedo to collect the money from Solo, dead or alive. When Greedo found Solo in the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine the next day, it became clear that he intended to kill Solo rather than give him a chance to pay Jabba. Han shot Greedo under the table, then paid the bartender for the mess, as he put it. Later, Solo found Jabba and a band of his thugs, including Boba Fett, in Docking Bay 94, where the Millennium Falcon' was docked. Solo managed to convince Jabba to give him more time, promising to repay him what he owed plus fifteen percent after being paid for a routine charter flight he and Chewbacca had recently arranged in the cantina, with an old man, a young farmboy and two droids, named R2-D2 and C-3PO.\n\n\u2022 Mercenary turned Rebel\n\nHan Solo to Luke Skywalker, regarding Obi-Wan Kenobis orders to stay with R2-D2 and C-3PO\nThe passengers, of course, were Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, who meant to escort the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 from Tatooine to Alderaan on behalf of the Rebel Alliance. Solo was skeptical of the old mans supposed past as a Jedi Knight and openly voiced his lack of belief in the Force, at some point while looking for a small training device for the young Skywalker, Kenobi sat down and decided to tell Solo a story on his youth about how he and his master once fought against Jedi Assassin Aurra Sing, which Solo again found hard to believe, as although he though the Jedi were a myth he also understood they wouldnt be easy to kill were they real.Once Bitten\nWhen they arrived in the Alderaan system, the crew and passengers of the Millennium Falcon found that the planet had been destroyed by the Death Star. After they were dragged on board by the Death Stars tractor beams, Skywalker convinced Solo and Chewbacca to help him rescue Princess Leia Organa by promising \"more wealth than you can imagine.\" Han helped Luke infiltrate the massive station in stolen stormtrooper armor and after several misadventures, they managed to rescue the Princess and escape, at the cost of Obi-Wans life, taken by his former apprentice, Darth Vader during their duel aboard the Death Star.\nAfterward, Solo took Leia, Skywalker, and the droids to Yavin 4 to collect his reward. Though he was initially willing to abandon the Rebels and make off with his fee, an attack of conscience, (brought on partly by Chewbaccas arguments) led him to join the Battle of Yavin at the last moment. The Millennium Falcon joined in just in time for Solo to destroy Black 3, which caused Black 2 to collide with and disable Darth Vaders TIE advanced. This allowed Skywalker to destroy the Death Star, scoring a major victory for the Alliance and recognition for Solo. As a result of this battle, as well as his earlier involvement in rescuing Organa, Solo and Chewbacca had a bounty placed on their heads: Specifically, 300,000 credits alive, due to their crimes of the liberation of a known criminal, direct involvement in armed revolt against the Empire, high treason, espionage, conspiracy, and the destruction of Imperial property.Millennium Falcon Owner's Workshop Manual\n\n\u2022 Hero of the Alliance\n\nDark Nest I: The Joiner King\n.]]\nSolo and Skywalker were both awarded medals of honor for their efforts in a grand ceremony. The day after the Battle of Yavin, he shot down an Imperial cruiser that was searching for the Death Star, much to the chagrin of his superiors. The chests of treasure the Rebels had given him were stolen from him almost immediately after leaving Yavin by the space pirate Crimson Jack (who, ironically, had ties to the Hutt crime lord), leaving Solo still unable to pay off Jabba. With the help of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, Solo managed to defeat the pirate.Star Wars (1977) 15 Following the debacle, Solo gave the recovered money back to the Alliance.\nBroke and fearing Jabbas retribution, Solo and Chewbacca discovered an ancient cache of treasure hidden in one of Yavin 4s temples. He took the treasure to an Ithorian named Sprool on Dennogra, who in turn delivered the money to Jabba. It was, however, too little and too late. Jabba kept the money and refused to call off the bounty. Han Solo was still a hunted man with a price on his head. He, however, used money earned from selling more of the treasure to purchase new T-65 X-Wings for the Rebellion.\nAfter the destruction of Alderaan Han still wanted to leave the Rebellion but for now he traveled with Chewbacca, Luke, Leia and the droids to Muunilinst. On the planet Leia was supposed to meet Mak Luunim who had the codes for some secret accounts of the Rebellion. When they flew with the Millennium Falcon a TIE fighter attacked them and an unknown pilot came to their aid. Afterwards the pilot crashed on a moon and Han and the others searched for him although they were still on their mission. On the moon they were attacked by a reek as soon as they found the pilot who said that his name had been Tobin Elad. On seeing the reek Han had shot with his blaster so they were surrounded in a cave and only Luke could disburden them. Then the group traveled to Muunilinst where they discovered that Mak Luunim was dead and Nal Kenuun had the codes of the Rebellion. Therefore Luke had to win a podrace to get the codes back. While he and Leia made a plan, Han and Tobin Elad were involved into an affray with some other racers. Later Luke won the race but Kenuun now wanted to get the head money of Han and Tobin. Leia then threatened to hurt the krayt dragon Urgiluu if Kenuun would not let her companions go. For this reason Kenuun exchanged the safety of the krayt dragon for the liberty of the group.Rebel Force: Target\nAt some point, Han Solo also arrived on Phelarion to rescue Leia (who had crash landed after a scouting mission gone awry), as well as two servants Sparv and Bikum Calus, the latter two being former acquaintances of Solo and planned to steal the megonite moss for a profit.\"Princess Leia, Imperial Servant\"\nLater, Han and Chewbacca were hired by Ramiz, a moisture farmer on Aduba-3, to protect his village from a band of local thugs known as the Cloud-Riders led by Serji-X Arrogantus. To help with this task, Han and Chewbacca hired six misfit spacers, including Don-Wan Kihotay, a Human who believed himself to be a Jedi Knight, Jaxxon, a Lepi with a mean disposition, and Jimm Doshun and his droid FE-9Q. Han, Chewbacca and the Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3 arrived at Ramizs village, Onacra, only to find it under attack by high-hounds. They managed to drive away the beasts, saving the life of a young girl named Merri to the great relief of her father Oncho, the village spokesman. But their relief was short-lived once Serji-X Arrogantus and his gang attacked. Han and the Star-Hoppers did their best to defend the village but it was to no avail as FE-9Q was killed and Merris grandfather, the Old One, dismissed the hired spacers help. Instead of relying on Han and his team, the shaman summoned a large, mythical reptilian monster called the Behemoth from the World Below to handle the invading Cloud-Riders. Many members of the Star-Hoppers died trying to destroy the creature. Using Kihotays lightsaber, Han managed to kill the deadly beast once and for all.\nHan Solo and Chewbacca left Aduba-3 soon after, in the Millennium Falcon, only to be captured once again by Crimson Jack and his gang of pirates. Princess Leia Organa had also been captured by the pirate while on her way to the Drexel system to find out what happened to Luke, and Jack intended to hold the Princess for ransom. But Han and Leia secretly devised a plan to trick the pirates into taking them to the Drexel system by claiming that the Rebels have stockpiled a treasure there. Accepting Solos claim, Jack went to Drexel where the met up with Luke and encountered Quarg, the Governor of Drexel, and the Dragon Lords. Han managed to escape on the Falcon, only to crash it near Quargs ship. Teaming up with the Dragon Lords, Han and Luke managed to save Leia, the droids, and Chewbacca. Han then faced off against Jack in space where he shot the pirate, killing him.\nAfter a misadventure on the massive gambling complex known as the Wheel, Solo hid out for repairs on Orleon and was soon besieged by an emissary of Jabba the Hutt. Within a week, Solo had rescued the emissary from stone mites and, by some miracle, had the bounty taken off his head. He returned to Tatooine, and started to heal his relationship with the Hutt. He made Kessel Runs for the crime lord, even beating BoSheks most recent record-breaking time. Sadly, this was not to last. The remains of Crimson Jacks Star Destroyer were discovered by the Hutts agents, and within days the bounty was back on Solos head. An even higher reward was registered for anyone who would capture him alive so Jabba could kill Solo himself.\n.]]\nWhile evading Jabba's organization, Solo and Chewbacca continued to work with the Rebel Alliance for the next three years. Solo became a good friend of Luke Skywalker, and developed a love-hate relationship with Princess Leia, cementing friendships after close encounters with bounty hunters.\nAround this time, Han sent Col Serra to create a new unit. It would remain secret for many years.\nDays before the Evacuation of Yavin, during negotiations with the Aquaris Freeholders, Han was \"accused\" of being an Imperial spy by Leia Organa. In truth, the accusation was just a ploy to draw out the real spy, Aquaris Freeholders deputy commander Kraaken, in their midst.\"Traitors Gambit\" In addition, shortly after the discovery of the development of the Super Star Destroyer Executor by Luke Skywalker during a reconnaissance mission at Fondor, Leia had him recover a power gem. Although he personally doubted the gems existence, he took the job when he realized that the alternative was allowing Leia to send Luke to find the gem when he returned from his mission, as Luke was \"not familiar with the Underworld.\" He initially tried to find intel on the gem at Junkfort Station, but his attempts nearly got himself killed when he deduced that some of the \"criminals\" who wanted to \"help\" Solo were really going to lure him to Jabba the Hutt for the monetary reward. He did nonetheless learn from one of the other attendees to locate the pirate Raskar for the sole known power gem remaining in existence. After locating Raskar and orchestrating a fight between Chewbacca and the reigning victor of the tournament outside of the ring so he could get close and find out how much power is left in the power gem, he acquired the power gem. He also swore that hell keep the true status of the shield properties of the power gem a secret after he learned about its decrease in power, as he and the Rebel Alliance only intended to use the gem once anyway, although he secretly intended to loot Raskar of all his ill-gained items as his punishment for the scam.\"The Power Gem\" After he returned to Yavin base with the power gem, however, he learned from Leia that Luke didnt make it back to Yavin due to an ambush.\"Iceworld\"\nAfter the evacuation of Yavin IV, the Rebellion was left without a base. Han and Chewbacca aided Hans new elite fighting force, Renegade Squadron led by Col Serra, in obtaining a holocron made by Bail Prestor Organa before Alderaans destruction. The holocron, encased in phrik, survived the planet's demise and contained a list of potential bases for the Alliance. During the battle to obtain it, Han was contacted by Boba Fett, who demanded the Holocron. The bounty hunter was fought off by the squadron, however, and the holocron was successfully obtained.\n.]]\nFollowing the damage sustained in the Alderaan system, Han, Chewbacca, and Renegade Squadron landed on Ord Mantell to make repairs. However, before the repairs were finished, the droid bounty hunter IG-88 discovered them and alerted the Imperials. During a battle with them, a power converter and an energy cell were found in the junkyards. Han repaired his ship, and he, Chewbacca, and Renegade Squadron took off from the planet, narrowly avoiding a Star Destroyer squadron. Shortly after, they learned that Gial Ackbar had been captured by the Empire while on a recon mission to find a new base. Han and Chewbacca helped rescue Ackbar.\nThe squadron learned from Ackbar that his crew had been captured by Boba Fett and sold as slaves on Tatooine. Han and Renegade Squadron landed on the planet and encountered Imperial resistance. During the skirmish there, they learned from a Rodian contact in a cantina that the slaves were being held in a shipyard; Han, using a fusioncutter, broke into the room the slaves were being held in and, along with Renegade Squadron, fought their way to the Millennium Falcon and escaped the planet. They headed back to Boz Pity, the new base of the Alliance. However, a tracker beacon had been placed in an R2 unit and they were tracked by Boba Fett, who then told the Imperials the location of the Rebels' new base on Boz Pity. An Imperial planetary assault force attacked the base; Han and Chewbacca helped prepare and pilot the evacuation craft that allowed Renegade Squadron and Ackbar to flee the planet.\nSix months after the battle of Yavin, Han was supposed to accompany Leia to a diplomatic meeting with Chivkyrie on Shelkonwa, but was reassigned to hunt pirate groups threatening Alliance supply lines, along with Luke. However, he was uncertain of his allegiance to the Rebels and only reluctantly accepted the job. While on their mission, they encountered the Hand of Judgment and developed a tenuous relationship with them, even after both sides learned of the others identity. Together, they defeated a group of BloodScar pirates. Learning that Leia was being hunted on Shelkonwa by the Empire and that the pirates had inside help from the governors office there, the ex-Imperials and Rebels infiltrated Shelkonwa, with the troopers posing as their escorts while they looked for Leia. Although the rogue stormtroopers left to assist Mara Jade, Luke, Han, and Chewie found Leia and, returning to the Hand of Judgments ship, escaped once the Hand returned. They were dropped off at the Falcon and made their way back to Alliance headquarters. Leia told him that he could stay in the Alliance for the sake of one person, and while she meant Chewie, Han preferred to think that he was in it for her, and continued to be part of the Alliance.Allegiance'\nFollowing weeks of searching for Vaders TIE Fighter, Solo and Organa stopped over at Ord Mantell, where he hoped he might make some money on the Sabacc tables and try to get Jabba his bounty. Before long, Solo found himself racing the Togorian Alfreda Goot to Tatooine, after the bounty hunter kidnapped Organa. Before long, Solo had inadvertently handed Vader back over the Empire, encountered a prototype Executor', and rescued the princess of Alderaan, all within the span of a short amount of time.\nLater on, Han, accompanied by Chewbacca, Leia, and Deena Shan, traveled to the planet of Aguarl 3. During an untimely detour on the dangerous planet, Han and his first mate, Chewbacca, were attacked by the creatures native to the planet. Fortunately, Leia and Deena were able to save them from the dangerous native wildlife.\n, Lumpy and Attichitcuk.]]\nNearly a year after the destruction of the Death Star, Chewbacca and Han left for the celebration of Life Day on Kashyyyk. It served as a short break between the periodical fighting. But peace did not last long for the pair. Not long after they departed Tatooine for Kashyyyk, they found themselves once again being chased by the Empire. Fleeing to lightspeed, they went on their way. However, the Empire had apparently traced their route to Kashyyyk, which they rightfully suspected to be a harbor for rebels. Upon learning of this, Darth Vader ordered a blockade and search of the planet. A group of Imperial officers entered Chewbaccas home, terrorizing his family and wrecking the house. They looked for any sign of rebel activity. However, after a while, Chewbaccas son, who then went by the name Lumpawarrump, devised a plan. He used his mini-transmitter, which he had received as a Life Day present from Saun Dann, to send out a voice message through the Imperial airwaves&mdash;which changed the sound of Lumpys voice. He gave the command of \"return to base,\" which the officers in the home picked up on their receivers. They complied, with the exception of the stormtrooper known as B4711, who was ordered by a superior to stay behind in order to temporarily watch the house for rebel activity. However, the trooper soon learned of Lumpys trick, and pursued him through the house, out onto the balcony, where Han and Chewbacca had just arrived. Chewbacca roared as Han managed to kill the trooper. That night, the group, along with the other Wookiees on Kashyyyk, celebrated an uninterrupted Life Day.The Star Wars Holiday Special\nOne year after the Battle of Yavin, Han provided support for Crix Madine and Rogue Squadron during the battle of Corellia and evacuated the Coronet Capitol Tower.\nAs part of the Rebel Alliance, Solo undertook many missions while trying to evade Jabbas organization. However, no matter how Han tried, he still encountered many bounty hunters who wished to carry out Jabbas bounty. On one such occasion, Han and Chewbacca returned to Ord Mantell where he encountered another bounty hunter seeking to collecting Jabba's bounty, the cyborg Skorr. Skorr had planned to use Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa to lure Solo into a trap. Solo and Chewbacca managed to evade the trap, rescuing Skywalker and the Princess in the process. Skorr accidentally killed himself with his blaster during a duel with Solo.\nWhen the Alliance lost a large shipment of ryll on its way to a Rebel medical facility, Solo was asked to use his underworld contacts to uncover its whereabouts. When conversation with fellow smugglers provided several leads, Solo arranged a meeting with Alliance Major Bhan in a cantina on Corellia. However, instead of Bhan, an ISB posing as a smuggler approached Solo and engaged in a conversation. It was soon interrupted by an arrival of Solos friend Col Serra, who informed him that Bhan was bush-walked on Tatooine, supposedly by the same individual Solo was talking to. The undercover agent tried to deny it, but Solo and Serra confronted him anyway. After a short fight, they subdued him and, leaving him on the floor, departed, oblivious to the fact that the operative managed to place a tracking device on Solo. Later, when the shipment was discovered to be located on the asteroid Skip 52 in the Smugglers Run, Rebel agents traveled there and managed to defeat ISB personnel trying to secure the ryll. Solo and Chewbacca took the Millennium Falcon to Skip 52 to help return it back to the Alliance, but were tracked via the beacon placed on Solo. A second team of ISB agents arrived to secure the shipment, and this time they were successful. Solo and Chewbacca managed to escape in the Millennium Falcon' with a few crates of ryll, though the rest had fallen into the hands of the Empire.\nOn another occasion, Han and Chewbacca came into the possession of some valuable glowing Tandgor gems, which he claimed would pay off debts and help pay to modify the Millennium Falcon. They stopped on an unknown planet to get fuel. After landing on the planet, Solo and Chewbacca were confronted by groaning skeletal figures; the undead. Chewbacca was able to fight them off and made a hasty retreat back to the Falcon only to find the fuel line had been severed by someone. Arming themselves, the two-man crew of the Falcon headed back and came face to face with a local and her baby who explained to the two that the crew of a \"Great Interplanetary Ark\" perished after their ship crashed in the planet's fog. They were compelled to wander the planet as corpses, terrorizing the locals every night.\nUsing the Tandgor Gems to lay down lines, Han formed a makeshift runway that managed to dissolve the fog. A ghostly apparition of the ship that crashed long ago used it to land, easing the spirits of the perished crew. The living dead would no longer terrorize the planets residents. Han and Chewbacca left the planet out of pocket, but were rewarded with enough fuel to last them the rest of their journey.\n\n\u2022 Crisis on Cloud City\n\non Hoth.]]\nHan Solo to Leia Organa\nAfter run-ins with bounty hunters such as Skorr and Cypher Bos on Ord Mantell, Solo resolved to leave his friends in the Rebellion and finally settle things with the Hutt. After Luke Skywalker disappeared while on patrol, Han went out to search for Luke on a tauntaun, although he ended up stranded alongside Luke in the blizzard. Because of these circumstances, he was forced to use his recently deceased Tauntaun as a makeshift heat source by borrowing Lukes lightsaber to cut its innards open until morning when Zev Senesca located him in a search operation. Likewise, during patrol, he managed to find a Viper probe droid and destroyed it, although not before it transmitted images of the Rebel shield generator and thus gave away their location. Before he could finish repairs on the Millennium Falcon and leave the Rebels Echo Base, however, he was caught up in the Imperial attack on Hoth. by Darth Vader.]] When Princess Leia and C-3PO were cut off from their evacuation ship, Solo took them on board the Millennium Falcon, which avoided Vaders Death Squadron by hiding in the Hoth asteroid field. When they were nearly trapped in the gullet of a space slug, Han flew the Falcon back out into the asteroid field where they were almost immediately detected by the Star Destroyer Avenger. Han, ignoring a warning from C3PO, moved his ship into an attack approach, flying directly over Avengers bridge. Subsequent tracking of the Falcon turned up no trace; Han had outwitted Avengers command by attaching his ship to the rear of the Star Destroyers conning tower with the Falcons landing claws. Han and his passengers later escaped undetected by drifting off amongst Avenger garbage dump before Avenger went into hyperspace. During their escape, Solo and Leia began to show their affection for each other, which would later lead to them falling in love.\nSince the Millennium Falcon repairs were still not complete, Solo went to the nearest safe haven&mdash;Bespin, home to Solos old friend Lando Calrissians tibanna mining facility, Cloud City. Unfortunately for Solo, he had been beaten there by Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Under duress, Calrissian made a deal with the Dark Lord to betray the Rebels in exchange for the continued autonomy of Cloud City. Calrissian invited them for \"refreshments,\" and led them into a room where Darth Vader sat, waiting. Han, with one of the fastest draws of his life, pulled his blaster and fired a couple shots at Vader, who easily blocked them and snatched the blaster out of Hans hands using the Force. Then, Boba Fett and stormtroopers surrounded the Rebels, capturing them. Solo was badly tortured on a scan grid by the Imperials who, according to him afterward, never even asked him any questions. While in his cell, Calrissian came and told the agonized Han about the custody of Leia and Chewbacca and Vaders plan to trap Luke Skywalker. Uncaring about the consequences and furious at his friends betrayal, Han slugged Calrissian before being subdued by the administrator's guard detail.\n\"]]\nShortly afterward, Han was taken by the Imperials to be frozen in carbonite as a test to ensure that Luke Skywalker would survive a similar freezing. There, surrounded by Darth Vader and his personal guard, he spoke his last words before being frozen. In response to Leia saying, \"I love you\" Solo responded, \"I know.\" (Listen) After being frozen, Han Solo went into a state of hibernation.\nFett, dubbing Vaders handiwork, Man in Carbonite,Shadows of the Empire 1 loaded the slab containing Solo aboard the Slave I, and departed for Jabbas Palace. After escaping Bespin, Skywalker, Leia, Chewbacca, and a repentant Calrissian set about planning Solos rescue.\n\n\u2022 Rescue\n\nHan to Chewbacca in their cell in Jabba's Palace\nIn 4 ABY, the group managed to locate Solo and set up a rescue operation. As a result of careful planning, Solo was brought out of carbon freeze by Leia disguised as Boushh, temporarily suffering from blindness, a symptom of hibernation sickness. However, Jabba was aware of Leias real identity and imprisoned Han Solo while Leia was to become his new slave replacing his previous favorite Oola. In his cell in Jabbas Palace, Solo was reunited with his partner Chewbacca. During his short period of captivity, a Bomarr Monk named Saida interviewed Solo, wishing to record the famous smugglers history. With the arrival of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo was brought once more before Jabba. He tried to barter for his life but to no avail, as he was considered a failure by Jabba. Han reunited with Luke as the two were sentenced to death and carried off to the Sarlacc pit.\nAt the Sarlacc pit, Luke turned the tables and a battle broke out. During the fight Calrissian redeemed himself by risking his life to save his old friend. Solo accidentally set off Boba Fetts jetpack which sent him flying into Jabbas sail barge then into the Sarlacc (though the hunter escaped well after the skirmish had ended.) Solo then managed to rescue Lando from one of the Sarlacc tentacles while hanging from one of the damaged skiffs, despite hibernation sickness still affecting him. The fighting ended with Leia killing Jabba and Han being reunited with his friends. The heroes quickly escaped Jabba's barge as it exploded due to a chain reaction set off by Luke by firing its cannon into its hull at point-blank range, and then left Tatooine after a fierce sandstorm when Luke revealed he had to go to Dagobah.\nSometime after this incident, Han volunteered to rescue Ithorians from the Empire. Han and Chewbacca found the Ithorians, destroyed several TIE Fighters, and dodged asteroids. They even ran into three more space slugs, barely missing him as they did during the Battle of Hoth.\n\n\u2022 Attack on Endor\n\n.]]\nEndor]]\nWith the death mark no longer on his head, Solo felt free to devote his time to the Rebellion.\nAfter recovering from hibernation sickness, he formally joined the Alliance and was commissioned as a general. He led a commando team, which included Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Chewbacca, on a mission to Endor to destroy the Death Star II's shield generator, which would allow a fleet led by Admiral Ackbar and Calrissian--now also a general--to move in and attack the station, hopefully capturing or killing the Emperor in the process.\nOn Endor Leia became separated from the group when she chased after two scout troopers on a speeder bike. Worried, Han, Chewbacca, and Luke, accompanied by R2-D2 and C-3PO, searched through Endors thick forest in order to locate her. However the group fell into a trap that appealed to Chewbaccas stomach and was captured by Ewoks, natives of Endor. They were eventually freed with the help of Threepio&mdash;who the Ewoks mistook for a deity&mdash;and Luke. Following their initial encounter, Han and the others became part of the Ewok tribe, forming a close bond with them.\nAfter their initiation into the tribe, Han led his strike force to the shield generator bunker. Solo didnt know, however, that he was walking into a trap; Palpatine himself knew of their attempt to destroy the generator. Solo and his force were captured, while a battle raged in space between the Rebel and Imperial fleets. Fortunately, with the help of the Ewoks and a timely reunion with Renegade Squadron, Han and the other Rebels were able to turn the tables and capture many Imperial troops.Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron After planting several 7-PrG proton grenades, Han destroyed the shield generator in time, killing Captain Sarkli on the way out (while also noting that Sarkli had picked the wrong side of the conflict),Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike allowing General Calrissian to begin his attack on the Death Star. The Death Star was finally destroyed, taking the Emperor with it. As the explosion of the Death Star lit the skies, Han said he was sure Luke got off in time, and Leia said \"I can feel it.\" Han, thinking Leia was in love with Luke, offered to step aside when he came back. Leia corrected Han, telling him Luke is her brother, shocking Han, and they shared a kiss as the celebration began. Solo later joined in the evenings banquet.\n\n\u2022 Hero of the New Republic (4 ABY&ndash;19 ABY)\n\nStar Wars (1977) 85]]\n\n\u2022 Truce at Bakura and aftermath\n\nShortly after the Battle of Endor, Solo accompanied Princess Leia and Luke as part of a task force to Bakura, which was under invasion by the Ssi-ruuk. The remaining Imperial forces were outnumbered and outgunned by Ssi-Ruuk invaders and, after the intervention of Alliance forces held off the alien invaders, the result was a truce between the Imperials and the Rebels. Han was uncomfortable in the presence of so many Imperials, and his customary lack of tact annoyed some of them as well. While on Bakura, Han tried to deepen his relationship with Leia, but circumstances kept them from spending much time together, and Leia was also distraught by seeing a vision of Anakin Skywalker. After a successful engagement led to the withdrawal of the Ssi-Ruuk, Imperial governor Wilek Nereus betrayed the Rebels and ordered them targeted. Leia was arrested shortly afterward for sedition but was rescued by Han. In orbit in the Falcon, Han prepared a ramming maneuver to allow the surrounded Alliance forces to escape. Fortunately, Luke was able to convince the Imperial fleet commander to surrender. Solo then aided the short, swift Bakuran overthrow of the government and was present at the surrender of Nereus. Shortly afterward, the Alliance of Free Planets was founded.The Truce at Bakura\nSolo later commanded Rebel forces in the Battle for the Eclipse in the Millennium Falcon that temporarily teamed with Tyber Zanns forces against Imperial forces in order to destroy the semi-built Eclipse. However, he was knowledgeable enough of Zanns character to suspect that Zann had ulterior motives in aiding the Rebel Alliance in the battle, and made clear that the instant he suspects that hell betray them, he will kill them before wishing Zann and his group good luck. Together, Zanns fleet and the Solo-commanded rebels destroyed three Cardan-class space stations, and as soon as a boarding party of Zanns had taken over the Eclipse, Solo realized Zanns ruse and attacked, but he and the rebels were soon driven away. Zann proceeded to destroy what remained of the Imperial fleet there and stole information he desired from the Eclipse before leaving it.Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption\n\n\u2022 Encounter with Boba Fett\n\nThough he won the Battle of Endor, Solo found himself in need of credits. Refusing to accept money from the House of Alderaan and the Rebel Alliance, Han, along with Princess Leia and R2-D2, went to Tatooine to access Hans bank account. However, his account was frozen due to his encasement in carbonite. Shortly afterward, R2-D2 was captured by Jawas. Unbeknownst to Han, the Jawas also captured Boba Fett, who was suffering from amnesia after escaping the Sarlacc. Han leaped from his moving landspeeder and entered the sandcrawlers cargo hold to find Artoo and Boba Fett; he was surprised the bounty hunter survived the Sarlacc too. Fett had temporarily lost his memory and helped Solo rescue R2 from the sandcrawler and onto the racing landspeeder. Unfortunately for Solo, Fett regained his memory due to Leias constant repetition of Solos name. Fett tried to shoot Solo, but missed. Solo and the others fled, leaving Boba Fett and the Jawas to be eaten by the Sarlacc. However, Fett was regurgitated by the Sarlacc, again.\n\n\u2022 Nagai-Tof War\n\nStar Wars (1977) 100]]\nAfter the Alliance of Free Planets was established, Solo, along with Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian were sent on several missions to bring secure attendees for the First Conference of Free Peoples. After these recruitment missions, the group decided to take a break to visit Chewbaccas family on Kashyyyk. Arriving on the planet, the group felt a sense of uneasiness about Rwookrrorro. With Chewbacca leading the way, they made their way to Chewbaccas home. However, they fell into a trap set by Chewbaccas brother-in-law, Vargi, and his mysterious companion, Knife. As it turned out, Knifes true intention was to set up a slave ring on Kashyyyk, using Chewbaccas family as hostages to keep the Wookiees in line. Fortunately, Han and Lando were able to break free.\nWhile Lando contacted the Alliance, Solo tried to keep Chewbacca from being brought onto a slaving ship. He managed to free Chewbacca but was interrupted by Vargi. Vargi dragged Chewbacca aside and proceeded to beat him for his attempt to escape. Han could not bear to see Chewbacca being unmercifully beaten and struck Vargi. Furious, Vargi went on a rampage and struck Solo, rendering him unconscious. Shortly afterward, Lando returned with weapons and armed the Wookiees still loyal to the Alliance. The Wookiees overthrew their rogue counterparts just as Chewbacca was able to overpower Vargi, throwing him to the ground. Han woke up just in time to see Knife escaping from the battlefield. Though Knife's slave ring had been dismantled, the skirmish on Kashyyyk would mark the beginning of the Nagai\u2013Tof War.\nThings went from bad to worse as certain members of the Alliance began to grumble about the manner in which the leadership of the Alliance was run, claiming it was too oppressive. The leaders of the discontent parties gathered on Kabray to share their concerns with one another. Most attending the gathering were non-military members of the Alliance, and had contributed little to the Rebellions fight against the Empire. In order to prove that their leadership was not aloof, Admiral Ackbar dispatched Han and Princess Leia, along with four Zeltrons as an escort, to the meeting on Kabray. Unfortunately, Han and Leia walked right into a trap and were captured by the Nagai. While Han and Leia tried to formulate a plan involving Leia pretending to faint, the Zeltron set their plan in motion, taking out the guards. Eventually, the Nagai were all rounded up and captured by Solo and the others, averting the Nagais strategic win on Kabray.\nShortly after the skirmish on Kabray, the Nagai forces and their Imperial allies attacked the forest moon of Endor, officially starting the Nagai-Tof War. While Ackbar led forces in space, Han and Luke ventured off to investigate a disturbance in the forest that had been reported by the Ewok Tippet. They found a squad of Nagai and Maccabree preparing to attack the Alliance base, covered by the diversion taking place in space. While Luke set off to warn the base, Han encountered the traitor Bey.\nAlthough Bey bested Solo in hand-to-hand combat, the Nagai commander, Knife, intervened and tried to shoot Han. Bey had not wanted to kill Han and so tackled Ozrei knocking the shot off target. This gave Solo a chance to grab his blaster and shoot Ozrei&mdash;and he did not miss. An anguished Bey revealed Ozrei was his half-brother, and allowed Han to continue on to the listening post. By the time he arrived there, the Maccabree had been driven off, flying away in their flight-suits.\nbrawl on the forest floor.]]\nThe war escalated once the Nagais sworn enemies, the Tofs, joined the war. The final battle of the war came at the Battle of Saijo after the Alliance allied with the Nagai and Empire against the Tofs and their leader Prince Sereno. Once the Alliance learned of Serenos and Lumiya's Saijo, a strike team consisting of Han, Princess Leia, Luke, Dani, Knife, Den Shiva, and one stormtrooper were sent to Saijo to neutralize the threat. Han and others were able to defeat the Tof and Lumiya, causing Prince Sereno to surrender. The Nagai Tof war finally ended.\n\n\u2022 Tracking Zsinj\n\nWarlord]] Zsinj\nThough not always a formal member of its military, and never holding official political office, Han Solo played an important role as part of the New Republic. Solo was instrumental in the Liberation of Kashyyyk, eliminating its oppressors such as the Trandoshan slaver Pekt and Moff Hindane Darcc.Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Solo went on to take part in the defeat of many warlords.\nIn 7 ABY, Warlord Zsinjs attacks on the New Republic had the populace frightened and discontented. Due to his reputation and public image, Solo was given command of a fleet group and charged with hunting down and killing Zsinj. His flagship was the Mon Remonda, a Mon Calamari Star Cruiser. Under his command were several other Mon Calamari cruisers, a few Imperial Star Destroyers, smaller frigates, and several starfighter squadrons, including Rogue Squadron, Wraith Squadron, Polearm Squadron, and Nova Squadron. Han and Zsinj played a dogged game of each pursuing and trying to trap the other. In one effort, Han employed a fake Millennium Falcon, known as the Millennium Falsehood, and another time got the aid of an Imperial Immobilizer 418 interdictor cruiser under the command of Teren Rogriss, his Imperial anti-Zsinj counterpart. In his final fleet battle against Zsinj in late 7 ABY, Solo and his fleet were led to believe that they had destroyed Zsinjs flagship, the Iron Fist Executor-class Star Dreadnought. However, Zsinj had fooled them by detonating a reconstructed Star Dreadnought as cover while the Iron Fist jumped into hyperspace.X-Wing: Solo Command\n\n\u2022 Disastrous courtship\n\nStar Wars: Shadows of the Empire: Evolution\nFollowing the hunt for Zsinj, Han returned to Coruscant and discovered&mdash;much to his dismay&mdash;that Leia was asked for her hand in marriage by Prince Isolder of Hapes. At a formal reception the Hapes delegation presented Leia with a number of gifts which included a Hapan Gun of Command and a special plant. Jealous and depressed, Han went into the undercity of Coruscant and won ownership of the planet Dathomir in a game of sabacc. Soon after he kidnapped Leia and took her to the planet to win her heart. However, they soon learned that the planet was home to the Dathomiri \"Force witches\" as well as Warlord Zsinjs hidden base of operations. Han was captured by one of the witch clans who hoped to trade him to Zsinj in exchange for a transport to escape Dathomir. Han was tortured by Gethzerion, the leader of the witches, before being rescued by Luke single-handedly piloting the Millennium Falcon' with the aid of the Force.\nBack at the helm of the Falcon, Solo managed to get past the shields of Zsinj's flagship. Solo called up Zsinj on the comm, telling Zsinj to \"kiss [his] Wookiee\" right before firing two concussion missiles into the bridge of the ship, killing the warlord instantly and essentially turning the tide of the Battle of Dathomir.\nAfter the Zsinj crisis, he married Leia, which made him the husband of the New Republics Minister of State and eventually Chief of State. Later that year Han and Leia were sent to Tatooine, with false prints and retina-concealing contacts disguised as a red-skunned Devaronian and a blue-skinned Twilek respectively, to recover the Alderaanian moss painting Killik Twilight which held an encrypted Shadowcast key which contained codes once in use by the Alliance. During their trip on Tatooine, the pair met many people who had known Anakin Skywalker when he had been a nine-year old slave and Podracer. A snag was thrown into the mission when a group of Imperials were also competing for the painting. They included Kitster Banai, the Rodian Wald, and the younger sister of Beru Whitesun, the woman who had raised Luke as his \"Aunt Beru\" and had been present during the burial of his grandmother Shmi Skywalker. They also discovered Shmis diary with the help of the Darklighters who now owned Lukes moisture farm. From this diary, Leia discovered that her father had not always been the evil monster she thought he was and learned to forgive him. Enlisting the help of some Squibs, Han and Leia went on a long chase to finally retrieve the painting, during which Han became lost in a sandstorm and suffered from dehydration. Leia and the Darklighter family rescued him and they were eventually able to retrieve the Shadowcast key, although the Empire gained possession of the painting.Tatooine Ghost\nThis adventure on Tatooine gave his wife a new understanding of Anakin Skywalker. Soon, Leia made plans with Han to start a family. Later, it was learned that she was pregnant with twins.\n\n\u2022 Return of the Empire\n\nDuring the Thrawn campaign in 9 ABY, Solo was heavily involved in foiling several of Grand Admiral Thrawns schemes. While trying to take care of his wife and unborn children, he was also involved in several diplomatic missions, some to fringe groups to recruit them, and some accompanying Leia on official New Republic delegations. Han helped fend off multiple attacks by the Noghri commandos on Leia, using what could best be described as unorthodox tactics to defeat them. When suspicious bank account activity implicated Admiral Ackbar, Han went to Lando to find a slicer to investigate the accounts. Lando and Han subsequently visited Talon Karrde on Myrkr to recruit a slicer, but events soon changed their mission completely when an Imperial Grand Admiral arrived and Han and Lando discovered that Karrde had been holding Luke Skywalker prisoner. Adapting to the situation, he and Lando evaded the Imperials and helped rescue Luke from the stormtroopers searching for him&mdash;both with Karrdes help. Following their departure from Myrkr, Han and the rest of the crew aboard the Millennium Falcon became embroiled in the Battle of Sluis Van, where they attempted to disable the mole miners that Thrawn was using to steal New Republic ships. While Lando was successful in preventing the theft, most of the ships were severely damaged. While Han labored to aid the New Republic against the Empire, he also had to deal with the political machinations of ambitious Bothan leader Borsk Feylya.Heir to the Empire'\nHan continued his search for the truth behind Ackbars accusations and Feylyas activities, journeying to New Cov. While following Tav Breillya, Feylyas aide, Han was stopped by Sena, but before they had much for discussion, they were interrupted by an Imperial raid. Fleeing in the Lady Luck with Lando&mdash;Leia had been using the Falcon&mdash;Han and Lando were escorted back to Peregrines Nest, where they met the legendary Corellian Senator Garm Bel Iblis and his private army. Han was impressed at seeing the former Senator again, even referring to him as sir, a title that rarely slipped from his lips. After Lando realized that Bel Ibliss ships had come from the Katana fleet, Han and Lando began a race with the Empire to find Bel Ibliss contact who had supplied the ships. Their search led them to the Coral Vanda, but a detour and ambush instigated by Niles Ferrier slowed them enough to allow the Empire to reach the contact, Hoffner, first. Thanks to coordinates supplied by Talon Karrde, who also knew of the fleets location, Han, Lando, Luke, and a small team traveled to the location of the fleet, arriving before the Empire did. As battle erupted, Han helped fend off the Imperial boarders while the New Republic Frigate Quenfis, its fighters, Rogue Squadron, and some of Karrdes ships held off the Star Destroyer Judicator. The arrival of Bel Iblis aided greatly in the battle, but the tide was finally turned when Han remotely piloted another Dreadnaught into the second Imperial Star Destroyer that had arrived, destroying it.Dark Force Rising'\n\n\u2022 Becoming a father\n\nHan was present when his wife gave birth to Jacen and Jaina, and was quite nervous and excited. When Imperial Intelligence infiltrated the Imperial Palace not long afterward, Han and Leia defended their children until help could arrive. As a result of the attack, the Noghri, who had been persuaded to help the New Republic, sent bodyguards to protect the twins while Han, Luke, Chewbacca, Artoo, Threepio, and Mara Jade went to destroy the Mount Tantiss fortress after springing Mara out of arrest. After landing the Falcon on Wayland, Han and the others journeyed through the inhospitable forests, fending off predators and other hazards. Reaching the fortress, they were joined by more Noghri, who had been clearing paths for them. Infiltrating the mountain while the local inhabitants launched a diversion, the Wayland insertion group attempted to destroy the cloning facility, with the help of Leia, Lando, and Talon Karrde, who had arrived to help in the Wild Karrde. Aiding Mara and Luke, who were challenged by the insane Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth, Han tried to shoot the deranged Jedi, but was hit with Force lightning and had his gun snatched out of his hand.\nSolo also played an important role in the defeat of the resurrected Emperor Palpatine in 10 ABY including infiltrating the Emperors Citadel on Byss.Star Wars: Dark Empire It was also during this time that his wife learned that she was pregnant with a third child: Anakin Solo. In 11 ABY, during the Battle of Onderon, he shot the last clone of the Emperor in the back, killing it. However, the Emperors spirit tried to enter the infant Anakin though he was stopped by the Jedi Knight Empatojayos Brand, who sacrificed his life for Anakin.Star Wars: Empire's End\nFollowing that, he and Chewbacca traveled to Kessel to persuade the planet to join the New Republic. Unfortunately for them, they only encountered hostility from the planets Rybet governor Moruth Doole and were put to work in the spice mines of the planet. During their captivity, they met a young Force-sensitive boy named Kyp Durron who helped them escape from Kessel. While escaping from Kessel, they avoided Dooles ships by flying into The Maw, an unusual concentration of black holes.Jedi Search\nIn the Maw, they discovered the Imperial research center Maw Installation which was under the command of Admiral Daala, the only female Admiral in the Imperial Navy. It was there that they discovered the Death Star prototype and the Sun Crusher. They eventually escaped Daala with the help of one of the researchers Qwi Xux and stole the Sun Crusher. Fleeing from the Maw installation, Han flew the Sun Crusher through one of Admiral Daalas four Imperial-class Star Destroyers destroying it. Admiral Daalas three Star Destroyers pursued the Sun Crusher and fought Dooles ragtag navy in a space battle above Kessel. Han would later play a role in the Battle of the Maw Installation, which resulted in the destruction of the Death Star Prototype and the Sun Crusher.Champions of the Force'\n\n\u2022 Jedi Search\n\n1\nLuke Skywalker to Han Solo\nLater when Luke was disabled by Kyp Durron and the spirit of an ancient Sith Lord named Exar Kun, Han and the family went to visit the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 and were baffled by his condition. During the dinner that followed, Leia, along with the twins and the students felt a great disturbance in the Force when the planet of Carida was destroyed by Kyp Durron. Han, who had befriended Kyp Durron, knew he was the only one with a chance of stopping him before he killed thousands more. Han and Lando took the Falcon in order find the errant Kyp. Once they found him, Han attempted to reason with Kyp and was making progress when Lando disabled the Sun Crusher with pre-existing command codes. However, Kyp bypassed the codes easily and was preparing to destroy the Falcon when Exar Kun was defeated by Lukes students. Free of the Dark Lords influence, Kyp yielded and was taken back to Coruscant for sentencing.\nAs Luke began the process of restoring the Jedi Order, Han, along with Leia and Chewbacca set out on a mission of their own, vital to the survival of the fragile New Republic. They began searching for the long-lost children of the Jedi. The quest took them to the Jedi planet of Belsavis, a nearly forgotten frozen world. Having heard tales of a Jedi exodus from the dark crypts below the planets surface, and also hearing that since the time of the exodus no one entering the crypts has returned alive, Han, Leia, and Chewbacca journeyed to Belsavis to start their search. Children of the Jedi'\n\n\u2022 Darksaber incident\n\nIn 12 ABY Han accompanied Luke to Tatooine where the Jedi Master had hoped to make contact with Obi-Wan Kenobi. After they arrived under the ruse of Tusken Raiders, Han and Luke visited Jabbas palace. They encountered a former associate of Jabbas, in the form of a disembodied brain connected with a life support system and a BT-16 droid, in the tradition of the mysterious Bomarr Monks. This former man, pleased to see enemies of Jabba, informed Han and Luke that the Hutts were planning to build another superweapon. Soon after the discovery, Solo and Skywalker revealed it to the New Republic, however, Durga the Hutts subordinates stole the plans from the Imperial Palace by creating a distraction through an \"accidental\" discharging of an honor guards ceremonial blaster rifle. In order to find out the location of the superweapon, the New Republic launched a covert operation to Nal Hutta that involved Leia, Han, General Crix Madine, Admiral Ackbar and then-general Wedge Antilles. Disguised as a diplomatic summit, Madine was able to infiltrate Nal Hutta, and deposit a small tracking device on Durgas ship, while Han, Leia and C-3PO met with Durga inside one of his bathhouses, who then allowed the New Republic access to one of his data slicers. It was this data slicer who revealed, much to Hans bewilderment and dismay, that the various Imperial Warlord fleets were unified and under the command of one Admiral Daala. After returning from the successful mission on Nal Hutta, Leia felt a stirring of the Force inside her, identical to the distress call Luke sent out to her above Bespin, and from the same sender. Han and Leia then moved in and rescued Luke and Callista near the Hoth asteroid belt in the Millennium Falcon. After this rescue, Han flew Luke back to his Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, only to nearly run headlong into Admiral Daalas Super Star Destroyer Knight Hammer. On the surface of the moon, Han and Chewbacca provided air support for the Jedi trainees, with Leia and Kyp Durron manning the quad laser cannons.Darksaber'\n\n\u2022 Planet of twilight\n\n.]]\nIn 13 ABY, Leia was taken captive by Seti Ashgad and Dzym, who took her to Nam Chorios. Han, Chewbacca, and Lando went to rescue her, but ended up delayed by the confusion caused by the outbreak of the Death Seed plague, and also they did not know where she was. Fortunately Leia was able to escape by defeating the Hutt Jedi, Beldorion. Soon after Han reunited with Leia and participated in the Battle of Nam Chorios, as a commander. The battle ended when Luke Skywalker managed to convince the Chorian crystal mind of the threat that Ashgad posed to the galaxy if his plans succeeded. As a result Seti was killed though Getelles still survived.Planet of Twilight\n\n\u2022 Waru\n\nIn 14 ABY, when his three children were kidnapped by the Imperial Procurator of Justice Hethrir, Han and Luke were on Crseih Station investigating rumors of a healing cult. Han had been increasingly worried about the change he had seen in Luke, in part due to his suspicions of Waru, the cults leader. He was also warned by an old acquaintance, Xaverri, to be wary of Waru. Originally unbeknownst to Han, Hethrir kidnapped his children and intended to sacrifice the Force-strong Anakin to Waru, which came from another dimension known as Otherspace. However, Hethrir was foiled by Han, Leia, Luke and his former mate Rillao.The Crystal Star'\n\n\u2022 Black Fleet Crisis\n\nShield of Lies\n.]]\nDuring the Black Fleet Crisis from 16 to 17 ABY, while his wife was serving as Chief of State, Han was charged with the day-to-day responsibilities of raising their three young children: officially, Admiral Ackbar insisted that he retained his rank and security clearances as a General, as Leias personal \"liaison for domestic defense\".Before the Storm'\nBecause of his wifes role as Chief of State, there were many attempts on her life. It was then that the Yevetha struck. An alliance of Yevethan worlds known as the Duskhan League intended to cleanse the Koornacht Cluster of all non-Yevethan species. They were armed with the Black Fleet which consisted of the Super Star Destroyer Intimidator (which had been renamed Pride of Yevetha') and its smaller escort Star Destroyers which they procured during a revolt against their Imperial master eight months after the Battle of Endor.\nDuring this time, Han was temporarily given the rank of commodore and was placed in charged of a massive New Republic fleet sent to patrol the borders of the Cluster. However, his shuttle was yanked out of hyperspace by a Yevethan Immobilizer 418 cruiser and he was brought before the Yevethan Viceroy Nil Spaar on the Yevethan homeworld of N'zoth. During his incarceration, Nil Spaar once transmitted a hologram to Leia in which he brutally assaulted Han for twenty minutes, saying only, \"Leave Koornacht now\".\nHowever, this only gave the New Republic a reason to invade the Koornacht Cluster and deal with the Yevetha. Several Wookiees including Chewbacca and his son rescued Han Solo from his prison on the Pride of Yevetha through the use of the Millennium Falcon. The New Republic was aided by the enslaved Imperials who mutinied against their Yevethan masters despite having no love for the New Republic. The Yevetha were finally defeated at the Battle of Nzoth and were disarmed and placed under close watch.Tyrants Test\n\n\u2022 Almanian Uprising\n\nLater in 17 ABY, Han met up with Jarril, an old smuggling associate of his, in the Crystal Jewel Casino on Coruscant. Jarril had came to warn Han about things happening in the Smugglers Run.The New Rebellion Han didnt really take him too seriously, until the Senate Hall was bombed during the course of their conversation. Han rushed off to the ruins of the Senate Hall and found that Leia had been injured in the attack. He felt that the attack had something to do with what Jarril had been warning him about, so traveled to Skip 1 on the Smugglers Run, along with Chewbacca, to investigate.\n.]]\nHan met a lot of his old smuggling friends, such as Ana Blue, Zeen Afit and Kid DXoln, who were a bit hostile to him, as they considered him to have gone legit. However, after finding the wreck of Jarrils ship, Lando Calrissian believed that Han was in trouble and headed to the Run to find him, despite the fact that Nandreeson, a crime lord based on the Run, had a placed a bounty on him. Lando was soon captured and when Han learned of this, he rallied together a number of smugglers to help rescue him. However, the smugglers were actually in Nandreesons pay and turned on Han during the rescue attempt. However, Han shot Nandreeson in the mouth with Chewbaccas bowcaster, killing him and allowing Han, Lando and Chewbacca to escape. They returned to Skip 1, where, shortly after, a number of droids bound for Coruscant, exploded and injured a lot of the smugglers. Han helped to transport some of the injured to Wrea, aboard the Falcon. Ana Blue also revealed to him that Kueller on Almania was behind everything.\nHan traveled to Almania and picked up Mara Jade on the way, despite the fact that he still didnt trust her, because she provided some ysalamiri to use against Kueller. When they arrived, the Battle of Almania was in progress between the New Republic and Kuellers forces. Han landed on the planet and went to help Luke and Leia, who were already there, but his ysalamiri were eaten by a thernbee. Nevertheless, his plan still worked, as the creature moved towards where Luke and Kueller were dueling and the ysalamiri pushed the force out of the area, allowing Luke to defeat Kueller.\n\n\u2022 First Corellian Insurrection\n\nHan Solo on his cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo\nIn 18 ABY, Han and the family took a vacation to Corellia, where they were hosting a trade summit in order to boost Corellia's economy. However the New Republic Intelligence Service remained wary of Corellia, maintaining that the situation at Corellia was unstable. En route to Corellia, Lieutenant Belindi Kalenda attempted to warn Han Solo and Chewbacca not to travel to Corellia&mdash;or at least not take his children, as Corellia was no longer safe. Distrustful, Solo refused to take her advice, seeing the trip as a family holiday. Once there, the Solo family decide to settle in with Governor-General Micamberlecto, and hired a Drall tutor, Ebrihim, as well as his droid, Q9-X2, to watch over their children while they were attending the trade summit. However Han soon discovered that the Sacorrian Triad and the Human League, headed by his cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo, was causing a political uprising that only went from bad to worse.\nThrackan declared himself Diktat of the Corellian System and declared the systems secession from the New Republic. He also used Centerpoints power to jam all system-wide communications, and demanded that all nonhuman races are to leave the system within a month, or he would vaporize a wide variety of New Republic planets. Han realized that Lieutenant Kalenda was right and aided in her escape. However, Han was captured by Human League thugs in the process.\n]]\nImprisoned with the Selonian Dracmus, Han was forced to fight the female Selonian for his cousin Thrackans amusement. However, communicating in Selonian, the two mostly staged the fight. Fortunately, the two were rescued by other Selonians, and, on a primitive coneship, managed to escape to Selonia. On Selonia, Han met up with Leia and Mara Jade and the three tried to convince the Overden to change their minds to the immense outrage of the Selonians. The Overden immediately released the three because of the grievous nature of Thrackan holding the Solo children hostage just as Luke Skywalker arrived, and the group planned a course of action. Enraged, the Sacorrian Triad waged war, and the Battle of Centerpoint Station began. Han participated in the war, and with the help of Luke, Leia, and Lando Calrissian, he was able to end the Insurrection and put Thrackan in jail. Hans children also played an important role in the battle as Anakin was able to use a planetary repulsor to stop the Starbuster beam from destroying Bovo Yagen.Showdown at Centerpoint\nIn 19 ABY, Solo made a nostalgic return to Jubilar, hoping to relive the adventurous times of his smuggling days. While negotiating a deal with Mayor Incavi Larado Baker to transport a shipment of Jandarra to the planet Shalam, Solo was attacked by Boba Fett, who had been informed of Solo's presence on the planet by Baker, an old informant. After a short fight, the two agreed to end their long-standing grudge and go their separate ways.\n\n\u2022 Caamas Document Crisis\n\nDuring the final days of the Galactic Civil War Solo acted as an unsuccessful mediator in the Diamala/Ishori dispute. Solo and Calrissian led a mission to Bastion to retrieve a copy of the Caamas Document.Specter of the Past Soon afterward, he was part of the final New Republic victory over the Imperial Remnant at the Battle of Bothawui.Vision of the Future Soon after the Caamas Document crisis, Han and the family attended Lukes and Maras wedding on Coruscant.Star Wars: Union\nAll three of his children were trained as Jedi at Luke Skywalkers Jedi Praxeum from 22 ABY, and Han and Chewbacca would often visit them with the Millennium Falcon.Star Wars: Young Jedi Knights'\n\n\u2022 Yuuzhan Vong War\n\nThe New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force'\nHan was involved in two of the first battles of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. He aided in the evacuation of Sernpidal, where the Vong brought a moon down on the planet. However, they were unable to save Chewie, who had saved Anakin from the impact by sacrificing himself. Anakin, knowing that going back would result in the death of the passengers aboard the Falcon, took off from the planet. He also aided New Republic forces in the Battle of Dubrillion.The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime After this he returned home to Coruscant with 3PO, as the others continued to help in the war effort. Han went into a period of grief. He closed himself off from friends and family, did little to care for himself, and turned to alcohol. His children commented on his increased alcohol consumption on several occasions, and there was obvious disconnect within the family. For a short time he blamed his son for the death of his long time friend. This was very painful for his son, Anakin, who heard his fathers words echo in his mind, \"You left him, you left Chewie!\". Eventually, Han reconciled with his son- who feared they would not be as close anymore- after coming to terms with the fact that he understood why his son had made the decision he had. Following the reconciliation Han realized he had never fully blamed his son but had been trying to distract his mind from blaming it on himself, and he felt as though Chewie would be unable to forgive him. Struggling with grief, and paying little attention to his loved ones advice, Han pushed the blame onto the Vong, who were most at fault for Chewbaccas death. This caused him to behave uncharacteristically and made him unconsolably enraged with the Vong.\n\n\u2022 Adventures with Droma\n\nA few months later, still dealing with grief, he left his family on Coruscant to go help his old friend, Roa. Roa was taken prisoner by the Yuuzhan Vong on Ord Mantell. Han then teamed up with his new friend, Droma to help save Roa. Also around this time, Han met and befriended Vergere, who had given him the antidote to cure Mara Skywalker of her disease. The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Heros Trial\nHan and Droma eventually traced the Ryns family to a ship piloted by members of the Peace Brigade that dropped off refugees at Vong targets. Han and Droma finally found the ship at Fondor and rescued Dromas family while Kyp Durron and others rescued refugees, including Roa from a nearby ship. They then all witnessed the destruction of three-fourths of the Hapan fleet and half of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet by Centerpoint Station fired by his cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo.The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse\n\n\u2022 Hero's trial\n\nLeia Organa Solo\nSolo decided that he could be best used helping the New Republic, rather than moping around in grief. He was assigned to the terraforming project on Duro, and worked with Jacen and Jaina to try and maintain a small refugee habitat on the surface. After his habitat was overrun by Yuuzhan Vong insects, he went to a nearby habitat which he was surprised to find was being run by Leia. The situation soon became very bad when Leia was captured and almost killed by Warmaster Tsavong Lah. Jacen and Jaina soon rescued their mother and the Falcon blasted into hyperspace from Duro.The New Jedi Order: Balance Point\nAfter Duro was taken by the Yuuzhan Vong, Han and Leia fled to Corellia for Leia to recover but were chased away by Thrackan, who was now governor of the planet. They then decided to take a short break to try and close the rift in their marriage that was formed by Hans grief over Chewbacca. While on vacation, Han and Leia ran into a previously unknown group of Jedi called the Wild Knights which was lead by Saba Sebatyne, and helped bring them to Lukes attention, and into the limelight of the war. When they returned to Coruscant, Han and Leia gained temporary custody of their nephew, Ben Skywalker, and the two formed a close bond.The New Jedi Order: Recovery\nSoon after, the Yuuzhan Vong created voxyn, Jedi hunting creatures that quickly killed many in the Jedi Order. To Hans dismay, Anakin volunteered to lead a strike team to Myrkr to destroy the voxyn cloning project. Han was reluctant to let Anakin lead in fear of losing someone else close to him. Although the mission was successful, Hans worst fears were realized when Anakin was killed fighting the extragalactic invaders during the mission, and Jacen was captured and presumed dead. Han and Leia helped each other deal with the grief of a lost son, and ended up with a stronger relationship.The New Jedi Order: Star by Star\n\n\u2022 War's end\n\nDuring the occupation of Borleias, Han, Leia and Jaina all played key roles in maintaining the New Republics hold as long as possible. Han and Leia dropped out of hyperspace into the middle of an enemy fleet, along with the Super Star Destroyer Lusankya. Thanks to Hans piloting, the Falcon and its cargo of Myrkr strike team survivors escaped the engagement unscathed. Han would later ferry those survivors to the Maw shelter, although he nearly turned back when Jaina came under attack. Han wanted to go to Coruscant in search of Jacen, but Leia talked him out of it, telling him that she needed him in the new Insiders organization. After they returned to Borleias from the Maw, Han continued to help Wedge in his defense of the planet.The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream After his sons surprise return from Yuuzhantar, Han lead a small fleet of Smugglers Alliance ships to help with the ambush over Ebaq 9.The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way After that, Han, Leia, Jaina and Tahiri Veila went from system to system trying to re-establish communications with the far flung reaches of the New Republic. During this time they saw the destruction of the Yevetha, the Ssi-ruuvi Imperiums newest attempt to take Bakura, and the Yuuzhan Vongs attempt to take out hyperspace channels with the Unknown RegionsThe New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee During a ambush gone wrong over Bilbringi Han and Leia helped save Wedge Antilles from certain death, when they rescued Jaina aboard a hijacked Golan II Defense Platform.The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy During the final days of the war, Han helped extract prisoners taken by the Yuuzhan Vong during the battle of Bilbringi.\nduring the last year of the Yuuzhan Vong War.]]\nWhen Zonama Sekot made its existence known near Coruscant in 29 ABY, Han and Leia traveled there to be reunited with the rest of their family. While there, they met Harrar, a Yuuzhan Vong priest. Solo also played a major role during the Recapture of Coruscant. Leia and Han, along with the Yuuzhan Vong priest, Harrar, Threepio and Artoo, crashed the Millennium Falcon into the well of the World Brain. With the help of Harrar and revolting Yuuzhan Vong heretics, they captured the Well of the World Brain. After the destruction of Shimrra and Onimi, Han and the others traveled with Nom Anor across the labyrinth the mighty war vessel of the Master Shaper. However, the executor turned on them, shooting his venom at Solo. Jacen managed to save him just in time. Before he could kill them off, Leia engaged Nom Anor, slicing off his hand in the process. They managed to escape and arrived at conclave on Zonama Sekot, which marked the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War. After the war ended, he allowed Chewbaccas son Lumpawaroo and nephew Lowbacca to carry on Chewbacca's life debt.\n\n\u2022 The Dark Nest\n\n\u2022 A cry for help\n\nKilliks]]\nDuring the five years of reconstruction after the Yuuzhan Vong war, Han and Leia were often doing the Jedi one favor after another to help an order that was stretched too thin. Because of all the help he gave to the Jedi Order they considered him a member, leading him to joke that he wanted a lightsaber. They also helped the Ithorians find a new home after the devastation of their planet, Ithor, during the Yuuzhan Vong War.\nHowever, he and Leia finally refused to help the Jedi when they heard that Jaina and several other Jedi Knights had been drawn to the Unknown Regions by a mysterious calling in the Force. Eventually, Han and Leia decided to follow several Jedi including Luke, Mara, and Ben into the Unknown Regions, where they discovered that Raynar Thul was alive, and had been taken in by a nest of Killiks. During the mission to Myrkr, Thul had been incapacitated by the Nightsister Lomi Plo and the Dark Jedi Welk. They took him and escaped on the Tachyon Flier, which was under fire during Myrkr outbound, where all three were presumed lost. In truth, the Tachyon Flier had crashed onto the planet Yoggoy, a Killik nest, and made all three Force-users into Joiners. Raynar Thul was integrated into the Yoggoy nest while Lomi Plo and Welk were integrated into the Gorog nest. .]] All became leaders of their respective nests, Raynar even created a new lead nest named Unu and became the Prime Unu, now reborn as UnuThul. They found that many non-Killiks had become part of the nests&mdash;part of the hive mind&mdash;after being around the Killiks for too long. These were called Joiners, and Han was terribly afraid that Jaina would become a \"bug hugger\" like the Joiners. The Yoggoy nests, and each other nest, except for Gorog, gained Raynar's sense of compassion and value for life, whereas the Gorog nest retreated into secrecy, due to the want of Lomi Plo and Welk to hide. The Gorog became the Dark Nest, and secretly controlled the other nests, without their even knowing.\nUnuThul greeted the Solos in Yoggoy hangar with a masterful display of his current Force power. In the Prime Chamber, UnuThul used \"we\" to address himself, stating Raynar Thul no longer existed and \"they\" were now UnuThul. Luke insisted that he sensed Raynar's presence in UnuThul, and guessed Raynar might be in hiding. Raynar then guided the Jedi to read the Chronicle on the wall, explaining the transformation of Raynar Thul to UnuThul, and the rise of the Unu nest. UnuThul explained the Unu nest as \"the nest of the nests\".\nStill refusing to surrender the location of Qoribu, UnuThul stated that anyone could leave whenever they wanted, and decided to assign a Yoggoy guide to escort the Jedi back to Lizil. The Jedi soon realized that such a collective mind allowed UnuThul to spy on them almost anytime and anywhere on Yoggoy. They visited the crash site, and Leia received Jacen's flow-walking message about Qoribu which was in the Gyuel system. Insects dark blue in color then attempted to assassinate the Jedi Masters at the crash site, which the Jedi barely escaped with Nanna killing several blue insects in the process. However, the Yoggoy guide that accompanied the Jedi denied ever seeing any blue insects before its death. When they traveled back to the hangar, Han and UnuThul exchanged harsh words on the matter of attempted assassination. As the debate became a stalemate, Luke proposed that it was another party who attempted to assassinate the Jedi, but UnuThul insisted that even if someone else attacked the Jedi, the hive mind would also be aware.\n\n\u2022 Swarm War\n\nJust prior to the Swarm War, Han and Luke had been taken prisoner by the Killiks in order to gain help for stopping the Fizz. Fortunately for them, both Solo and Skywalker were resistant to the joining process. They eventually escaped and participated in the offensives against the Killiks. During the crisis, Han and Leia were captured by the Chiss so they would not stop the Swarm War. They escaped, and eventually stopped the Chiss from unleashing their bio-weapon on the Killiks.\nAround this time Han and Leia found out about the birth of Tenel Kas daughter Allana, unaware that she was their granddaughter through their son Jacen. Tenel Kas and Jacen's reluctance to talk about Allana surprised them which caused Han to remark that the father must have been ugly if Tenel Ka refused to talk about her.\nThe entire crisis was a nightmare for Han, due to his traumatic experience years before with the Kamarians of the Cult of Varn. That experience had given him a deep-seated unease around sentient insects.\n.]]\n\n\u2022 Second Galactic Civil War (40 ABY&ndash;41 ABY)\n\n\u2022 Rising tensions\n\nLegacy of the Force: Betrayal\nIn 40 ABY, a Jedi mission to Adumar by his son Jacen and his nephew Ben Skywalker to uncover an illegal missile factory on the planet ended in a violent ambush, from which the Jedi narrowly escaped with their lives. The incident sparked political unrest that threatened to ignite into total rebellion that could shatter the young Galactic Alliance. In a desperate attempt to avoid such a fate, the Alliance readied a preemptive display of military might in a bid to bring the rogue worlds to heel. In a display of poor decision-making, Corellia, Solo's home planet, was chosen as target of this exercise.\nSince Han Solo was a Corellian, this incident turned him against the Galactic Alliance. Worse, relations with his son Jacen and the Skywalkers were ruined after Jacen chose to stand with his uncle, Luke Skywalker, on the side of the Galactic Alliance. But when the Corellians launched a counterstrike, armed conflict was ignited and civil war broke out among those of the Galactic Alliance. As the Galactic Alliance began making more repressive laws, many began seeing it as a new Galactic Empire. Throughout the Galactic Alliance, families found themselves divided and old friendships were torn apart.\nThat year, alongside Wedge Antilles, Han led Corellian forces at the Battle of Tralus. Hans actions were vital as he flew one of the bombers that led to the destruction of the Alliances base and stronghold on Tralus. His daughter and wife were in the opposing Alliance fleet, although Leia was secretly aiding the Corellians by instructing fighters not to attack Hans and Wedges ships.\nAnd while all this was going on, his son Jacen Solo became what the Jedi feared most: a Sith.\n\n\u2022 Allegiance with Corellia\n\nLegacy of the Force: Bloodlines\nLater, Han Solo and his old enemy, Boba Fett, were drawn together as they both learned some harsh truths about their own kin. Thrackan Sal-Solo put a bounty on Han and his family. Han finally decided to kill Thrackan, to forever end the threat. Fett agreed to help Han, in exchange for aid in finding his long-lost daughter, Ailyn Vel. Solo posed as a Mandalorian soldier working for Fett, and began strangling Thrackan shortly after encountering him, but Boba Fetts granddaughter Mirta Gev actually made the killing shot, with Boba and Han adding at least three more. Sadly, Ailyn Vel had been killed by Jacen during an interrogation. Horrified and outraged, Han disowned his son saying his son would never have done such a thing. Afterward, Han questioned Leia upon Jacens upbringing, wondering if they were at least partly to blame.\n.]]\nShortly afterward, Han, Leia, and C-3PO were summoned to the Kiris Asteroids where the secret Corellian fleet was located. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by Wedge Antilles who was recently promoted to the rank of admiral. Han believed that he was summoned to help Antilles defeat the Blockade of Corellia but he was proven wrong once Dur Gejjen interfered. Instead of leading the attack with Wedge, Han and Leia were tasked with being decoys in order to draw Queen Mother Tenel Ka onto Corellias side. Though disappointed, Han nonetheless did as he was told though he felt suspicious and uneasy. Traveling to Hapes in order to warn Tenel Ka of danger, Han and Leia learned that Gejjen had been using the Solos to disrupt Tenel Kas security routine and draw her out into the open for an attack. In the process of warning her, Han and Leia unexpectedly walked into an assassination attempt on her life by the assassin Nashtah. Due to a series of unfortunate events, the two were forced to work with the assassin in order to escape. The three then set their course for Telkur Station. En route to the station, Han and Leia felt uncomfortable around Nashtah, though they insisted on finding the identity of the coups leader. During their conversation, Nashtah revealed to Han and Leia that shed seen Leias father race in the Boonta Eve Classic. It was then that Leia revealed the reason for having children, though Han was upset about revealing such information to a stranger.Legacy of the Force: Tempest'\nThey arrived on Telkur Station, only to encounter Jagged Fel, who was presumed lost after the Battle of Tenupe during the Swarm War. During their conversation, Fel revealed that he was marooned on Tenupe for two years after being shot down by Leia. While on Tenupe, he had discovered that Alema was still alive and seeking to kill Leia and her family in revenge for crippling her during their last duel. He also revealed that his family was going through financial troubles, causing him to become a bounty hunter. After the conversation, the three were drugged while Jagged slipped away. Han and Leia eventually escaped Nashtah, only to gain a new passenger by the name of Lalu Morwan. After delivering their findings to Tenel Ka, Han disarmed Morwan and locked her up in one of the Falcons compartments, burning one of his hands from blaster fire in the process. Shortly afterward, Han and Leia came across Jaina, Zekk, Ben and his crew, taking them aboard the Falcon during the Battle of Hapes. However, Jacen ordered the Star Destroyer Anakin Solo to open fire upon the Millennium Falcon. Han and Leia escaped the confrontation, but with the Falcon turrets and central core destroyed by the turbolaser blasts. During the battle, Han's nephew, Ben Skywalker, attempted to arrest Han and Leia for crimes against the Galactic Alliance. In an attempt to arrest the two, Ben accidentally slashed Zekk in the abdomen when he was restraining Ben, severely injuring Zekk. After making sure that Jaina, Zekk, Ben and his crewman escaped, Han and Leia escaped into hyperspace.\nAfter escaping into hyperspace, Han and Leia traveled to Tendrando Arms to repair the Millennium Falcon. There, Han and Leia reunited with Lando Calrissian, who left with them in his personal yacht, the Love Commander, and left C-3PO with the Falcon. They managed to get through Corellias security zone, partially due to their deceitful disguises and Leias use of a Jedi mind trick.Legacy of the Force: Exile\n\n\u2022 Break with Corellia\n\nMeeting with Denjax Teppler in a Coronet cantina, they discovered that Teppler nor Wedge knew of the conspiracy to kill the Queen Mother and that it was the doing of Dur Gejjen. After their conversation, the group was forced to exit the cantina after several CorSec officers tracked Teppler to the cantina. Leia, Han, and Lando parted ways with Denjax shortly thereafter, being chased back to the Love Commander. Only with the intervention of the Pulsar Skate and the Errant Venture were Han and the others able to defeat the Corellian fighters attacking them. Onboard, Han and Leia were finally able to reunite with their friends and family. They also encountered the smuggler Uran Lavint, who informed them of Alema's existence on the ship and the conference being held on Gilatter VIII. Unknown to them, Alema had been looking for Han to kill him and make Leia suffer. He and Leia later went to Gilatter VIII to rescue Jacen from a Confederation ambush. However, Jacen fled the planet, leaving them behind to deal with Alema and the Confederation.\nUnbeknownst to Han and Leia, Jacen initially decided to make them his sacrifice for his ascension to Sith Lord; however, he later killed Mara Jade Skywalker instead. Han, along with Leia, also went to Hapes to comfort Luke in his grief in the loss of his wife.Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice\nThen, Han and his wife slipped into Coruscant, as Leia was scheduled to deliver the eulogy for Mara. However, Jacen sent a squad of GAG troopers to intercept them. Naturally, Han and Leia refused to be arrested peacefully and escaped after a short firefight in the halls of the Temple, ditching their plans to attend the Funeral of Mara Jade Skywalker.Legacy of the Force: Inferno\nInstead, Han and Leia went to Kashyyyk to persuade the Wookiees not to join the Galactic Alliance. However, they encountered some difficulties in the form of old Wookiee grudges and two GA Intelligence agents, Tarfang and Jae Juun. Thankfully, Luke and the other Jedi arrived after making their final break with Jacen, and Jaina also arrived on the Wookiee homeworld. Angered by the betrayal of the Jedi, Jacen followed Luke in the Anakin Solo and brought the Fifth Fleet with him. After the Wookiees refused to yield the Jedi and the Solos up to Jacen, Jacen bombarded the planets wroshyr forests, causing further outrage to Han, who was prepared to take the Millennium Falcon up to attack the Anakin Solo himself. He was talked out of it by Luke, who along with the other Jedi led a StealthX strike on the GA fleet. Luke allowed others to believe that he had been shot down by his niece Jaina while she was trying to hit Jacens StealthX, and boarded the ship to confront his nephew and rescue his son.\nWhile Han and Leia were traveling to Hapes, Leia felt Luke's presence disappear and believed he was dead, but Han refused to believe it, thinking that it would take a change in the laws of physics to kill Luke Skywalker. When they got to Hapes, they convinced Queen Mother Tenel Ka to stop supporting Jacen Solo. Han and Leia were relieved when they returned to Kashyyyk and found Luke still alive.\nLater, Han and Leia sanctioned Confederacy assassination attempts on Jacen while planning their own justice with the Jedi for their son.\nHan later accompanied Jaina, Zekk, and Jagged on their quest to end Alema Rar. He used the Falcon to rescue them from the asteroid they found Alema in after she had been killed.\n\n\u2022 Betrayal\n\nHan was later part of the strike team that boarded the Anakin Solo to rescue Allana from Jacen. After the successful rescue, Han and Leia learned from Allana that Jacen was her father. The discovery that he was a grandfather came as a pleasant surprise to Han.\nHan was also present on Endor when Ben showed his family a recording that proved Jacen killed Mara Jade Skywalker. Han was shocked by the discovery.\nFollowing Jainas training under Boba Fett, she revealed to Han and Leia that she had to be the one to kill Jacen, now known as Darth Caedus. Jaina embarked on a mission, dueling Caedus first on Nickel One, and then encountering him on the Anakin Solo. After a duel and being mortally wounded, Caedus stopped fighting so he could warn Tenel Ka about a threat to Allana. Jaina thought this to be a trick and killed him, horrified when she felt Jacen reaching out to Tenel Ka. Afterward she believed that Jacen had been himself at the end, though knowing that there was still too little of him to be saved. Han still believed that Caedus would have killed Jaina. Though the Solos struggled to get through this hard time, they were able to remember Jacen as the kind young man he had once been, not the Sith he had turned into. The war had ended, and though Han had lost much, peace was finally at hand. Additional comfort and joy came from Hans granddaughter, Allana, whom Tenel Ka had given to Han and Leia to raise under the pseudonym Amelia because she knew that they could give the girl a safer life than she could on Hapes.\n\n\u2022 Post-Second Galactic Civil War (43 ABY&ndash;)\n\n\u2022 Origins of the Millennium Falcon\n\nHan and his wife were able to come to some terms with losing their other son and they busied themselves by taking care of their granddaughter, given the name \"Amelia\" to hide her identity. While on an outing in the Falcon with Leia and Allana, the young girl found a camouflaged transponder aboard the Falcon. It had been placed there more than half a century before by the Republic Group, an organization that tried and failed to keep the Republic together and honorable in its waning years. It was meant to find its way to the planet of Toprawa, but a collision with another craft had made this impossible. Because Han and Leia had been telling Allana about how Han had acquired the Falon, she thought that they could track down all the people who had owned the ship, finding out what the mysterious component was along the way. Her grandparents agreed.\nThey traveled to the planet of Lujo to visit Lando Calrissian and his family at on of their homes, where they stayed for a few weeks. Han asked Calrissian who he had won the Falcon from and Calrissian pointed him to Cix Trouvee. Additionally, one of Calrissian's technicians, Tal-lik-Tal, examined the transponder and found that it was comparable to pre-Imperial designs and still active.\n\n\u2022 Lost Tribe of Sith emergence\n\nFate of the Jedi: Outcast'\nAfter Natasi Daala was elected the new Galactic Alliance Chief of State, tensions began to rise between the government and the Jedi Order. This eventually resulted in the arrest of Luke, though after an agreement between Skywalker and Daala, Luke exiled himself from the Jedi Order and subsequently began a quest to learn what had lead to Jacens fall to the dark side. The Solos were soon contacted by Lando and were forced to aid him in saving the planet of Kessel which had succumbed to violent earthquakes at the time Centerpoint Station was destroyed. The Solos discovered a strange species of pure energy based beings living within Kessel, who monitored every gravity well in the galaxy, and who had begun to leave en masse, causing the earthquakes that wreaked across Kessel. Ultimately, however, the Solos and their allies proved able to save Kessel from destruction. Later, Han and Leia traveled to Dathomir, as Luke had tracked a Sith girl there. Solo had several adventures on the world, such as an attack by Nightsisters. Han and Leia then returned to Coruscant, and Han was newly appointed as a general.Fate of the Jedi: Backlash Solo later participated in the coup that removed Natasi Daala as Chief of State and placed the Jedi in charge of the government, and then he traveled with Leia and Allana to the planet Klatooine in order to end a slave rebellion there.Fate of the Jedi: Conviction'\n\n\u2022 Personality and traits\n\nLegacy of the Force: Invincible'\nHan Solo was known for his cockiness, dry wit, rudeness, piloting skills, and his fast draw. He also had an affinity for Sabacc and other gambling games. He often boasted of his achievements he made in his ship the Millennium Falcon, such as making the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, and being able to outrun Imperial Star Destroyers. Captain Solo was quite the mechanic, having made countless modifications to the Falcon alongside Chewie. He once said he preferred to shoot first as opposed to shooting second, and used to his advantage on at least one occasion the fact that he was ambidextrous. Han Solo was also one of the few people to evade Boba Fett on multiple occasions. During the Second Galactic Civil War, when he began to distrust the New Jedi Order because of his beliefs that Corellia should be able to have independence, Leia often referred to him as \"the most dangerous man in the galaxy\".\nHan was not known to be Force-sensitive, unlike his wife, children and many of his friends, although due to his experience with the Force via his friends and family, he was Force-attuned. Despite his family and frequent companions including some of the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy, Han was far from helpless in comparison. His ability to think up inventive and often extremely unorthodox solutions to problems on the fly proved to be a constant source of frustration to all enemies he encountered (and often his friends). This, combined with Hans peerless skill at the hands of the Millennium Falcon as well as the legendary \"Solo Luck\" more than compensated for any lack of Force sensitivity. During his daughter Jainas wedding, however, Jaina speculated that he may have potentially possessed a mild form of Force-sensitivity.Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse\nHe was, however, a man with insecurities as well. He was overprotective of his ship and hated times when the Falcon was modified or repaired too much, especially by droids, as tight bolts on the craft wouldnt let him feel how hard they were hit by laser fire, resulting in him loosening several of them around the ship. He was also hesitant to let Chewbacca, Lando or anyone else fly it. Han also vowed jokingly to never give the codes for the Falcon' to his son Jacen, at least not in his lifetime.\nAmong the multiple skills he developed during his early career, Han Solo became familiar with the practice and details of dishwashing.\nHan Solo was known to dislike droids and discouraged them from travelling in his ship, although he relented in certain circumstances. After he joined the Rebellion, he allowed C-3PO and R2-D2 free access to the Falcon, as a special case and in attention to Luke Skywalkers and Leia Organas wishes; Solo nevertheless rarely had a good word to any of the droids.\nHe had a particular distaste for \"bugs\", as he revealed during the Swarm War, probably due to the run-in with Kamarian religious fanatics early in his smuggling career. Han also had a loud snore which bothered Leia.\nIn addition to speaking his native Basic, Solo fluently understood many other languages, including Shyriiwook, Traders argot Rodese, Illodian, and Huttese. He could also imperfectly speak Mandaba, the Selonian language.Assault at Selonia' Although he spoke Basic with a Corellian accent for much of his life, he had developed more of a Coruscanti accent by 40 ABY.\n\n\u2022 Romances\n\nDuring his life, Han Solo had several romances.\n\n\u2022 Bria Tharen\n\n]]\nHis first serious relationship occurred during the time Han was working for Besadii on Ylesia. Known to him only as \"Pilgrim 921\", Bria Tharen immediately attracted Hans attention thanks to her facial features and Corellian accent, even as she was processing glitterstim in the complete dark. Together they fled Ylesian \"paradise\" and made their way to Brias home on Corellia and the couple eventually traveled to Coruscant, where Han planned to apply to the Imperial Academy. It was there when Bria left Han to confront her addiction to the Exultation after she helped her lover to obtain the money for \"buying the new personality\". This relationship haunted Han for a very long time and forced him to make a decision not to fall in love again.\nThey would eventually meet again during the Rebel raid on Ylesia. Unfortunately, it turned out that Bria was using Han and other smugglers for the Rebel gains. Even after this incident, Han would later feel sorry for her and sadly pass on the message about Bria's death to her family.\n\n\u2022 Xaverri\n\nHis \"second\" relationship five years after his breaking up with Bria Tharen was with traveling magician and illusionist named Xaverri. They met after her performance on Nar Shaddaa, started going out and on their fourth date, Xaverri revealed her past to Han, who in turn shared his own background and troubles with the Empire. She also told Solo that this was the first tour where she hadn't spent her spare time plotting against the Empire. Han offered his services as an assistant for her show and a pilot, and she agreed. Shortly after, Xaverri and Han deepened their relationship to an intimate level. Feeling that being around Han and Chewbacca had made her too soft, too vulnerable, and too attached to him, she left him after several months.\nThey would later team up during the Battle of Nar Shaddaa and eventually after many years on Crseih Station. Han would later reflect that he might have had a future with her if she hadn't left him.\n\n\u2022 Salla Zend\n\nBeing his fellow smuggler, Salla Zend \"replaced\" a position of Han's girlfriend after his unsuccessful romance with Xaverri. In time, the initially harsh woman became more attached to Han. Not feeling the same way, he was forced to virtually \"escape\" from her.\nShe never forgot his actions and upon meeting again during the resurrected Emperor crisis reminded him of what he had done.\n\n\u2022 Katya M'Buele\n\nAt some point in his smuggling career, Han Solo partnered with Katya MBuele, with whom he infiltrated the restricted world of Skye. They were the sole survivors of that unfortunate smuggling operation. Solo met MBuele again two years after the Battle of Yavin, but Katya was killed shortly thereafter by a Smoke Demon under the control of Majestrix Kharys of Skye.\n\n\u2022 Leia Organa\n\nHan Solo\nHan first spotted her when she was just a little princess on a lap of Viceroy Organa, whose prerecorded message welcomed all ships arriving on Alderaan. After ten years, when they actually first met, the two got off to a rocky start; however, as they worked together during the Galactic Civil War, Leia and Han developed a relationship that would last throughout the war. Their love fully manifested shortly before Hans capture by Boba Fett. Despite Leias later occasional suitors like Fenn Shysa or Prince Isolder, Han never lost his \"femme fatale\" from sight.\nIn 8 ABY, the two were married and had three children, Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo, in the next two years. Even with the death of their youngest child Anakin and estrangement and death of Jacen in 41 ABY, their relationship grew stronger. By the time of 43 ABY, having been married for more than thirty-five years, they loved each other even more than they did in 8 ABY.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\n\u2022 Origins and development\n\nHan Solos opening line in the rough draft of The Star Wars'\nHan Solo was created by George Lucas during the development of Lucass 1977 film Star Wars, and is present in Lucass 132-page The Star Wars: Rough Draft, completed in May 1974. In the draft, Solo is a Ureallian, and is described as a \"huge green-skinned monster with no nose and large gills\". He is a member of the Jedi Bendu and an old friend of General Skywalker. As Lucas refined his story, Solo evolved into a burly, bearded, flamboyantly-dressed pirate. Although Lucas had originally intended for Solo to be a nefarious alien character, he settled on the idea of a Human so that he could develop more of a relationship between the films three primary characters. Chewbacca thus filled the role of the alien sidekick.The Characters of Star Wars - Star Wars Trilogy (DVD) By August 1975, when Lucas had written his third draft, Solo was described as: \"A tough James Dean style starpilot about twenty-five years old. A cowboy in a starship -- simple, sentimental and cocksure of himself.\" This incarnation of Solos character went on to appear in the finished film.\nWhile developing Solos character, Lucas defined him in relation to the films hero, Luke Skywalker. Selflessness was an important theme throughout the film, and Skywalker was a selfless young idealist. Lucas thought of Solo as the sidekick with contrary morals to the hero, and wrote him as a selfish character. Harrison Ford, who portrayed Solo in all three films of Star Wars original trilogy, has described Solo as the smartass to Skywalkers callow youth, with each character having had a clear section of turf to explore.Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy\n\n\u2022 Portrayal\n\nCarrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, the latter improvising a Han Solo-esque line into The Empire Strikes Back\nWhen casting the role of Solo, Lucas sought actors who had individual screen presence as well as chemistry with Skywalker. He wanted Solo to be older than Skywalker and to possess a cynical edge. Lucas desired new and unknown actors to play Star Wars major roles, and originally forbade Harrison Ford from auditioning, having worked with him on the 1973 film American Graffiti. Ford was working as a carpenter on the set of the auditions, and was brought in by Lucas to feed lines to the actors who were auditioning, including Kurt Russell, Nick Nolte, Christopher Walken, and Perry King. While feeding lines, Ford impressed Lucas by giving the character a mix of mercenary swagger and world weariness, and convinced the director to let him play the part.\nFord went on to portray Solo in both of Star Wars sequels, 1980s The Empire Strikes Back and 1983s Return of the Jedi, as well as 1978s The Star Wars Holiday Special. He was hesitant to sign the contracts for the sequels, however, feeling that Solos character should be killed off. When Lucas was discussing the script of Return of the Jedi with director Richard Marquand and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, the three were unsure if Ford would return for the film. Solos character had been frozen in carbonite during the climax of The Empire Strikes Back, and Ford was a rising star in Hollywood following his starring role as Indiana Jones in 1981s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Ford himself thought that Solo should die in Jedi, sacrificing himself to save Skywalker and Princess Leia. He reasoned that Solo had no family, future, or responsibilities to the story, and that his death would give the story some resonance. Kasdan also believed that a major character death early in Jedi' would keep audiences worried, believing that none of the characters were safe. Lucas vetoed the idea, however, and Solo ultimately survived.\nThe script of The Empire Strikes Back originally called for Solo to respond to Princess Leias declaration of \"I love you\" with \"I love you too\". Ford disliked the line, feeling that the established character of Solo wasnt being taken advantage of. After many takes, director Irvin Kershner wasnt satisfied either. He told Ford not to think about it, and to say whatever he thought that Solo would say. When Ford improvised the line \"I know\", Kirshner felt that it was perfect for the character, and it was included in the films final cut.\nSolo was voiced by Perry King in the trilogys three radio dramas, and by various voice actors in different Star Wars video games: Neil Ross in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Masters of Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si and Star Wars: Force Commander, David Esch in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, Lex Lang in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike and Star Wars: Battlefront II, and John Armstrong in Star Wars: Empire at War and Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. James Gaulke leant his vocal talents for the Dark Forces: Jedi Knight audio drama,Dark Forces: Jedi Knight audio drama and Joe Hacker for the audio adaptations of Dark Empire, Dark Empire II and Empire's End.Dark Empire audio dramaDark Empire II audio dramaEmpires End audio drama\n\n\u2022 In Star Wars media\n\nA. C. Crispin\nIn addition to all three installments of the original trilogy, Solo has appeared in a wide variety of Star Wars novels, comic books, video games, and other media. In the late 1970s, he was the focus of some of the earliest Expanded Universe material. After Marvel Comics adapted the first Star Wars film into a six-issue series, they began producing original stories in 1978; the first story arc focused on Solo and Chewbacca teaming up with a group of starhoppers on Aduba-3.Star Wars (1977) 7Star Wars (1977) 10 Author Brian Daley wrote The Han Solo Adventures in 1979 and 1980, novels which told tales of Solos life as a smuggler before he joined the Rebellion.Star Wars: The Han Solo Adventures'\nSolo played a starring role throughout Marvels 107-issue run,Star Wars (1977) as well as in the concurrent newspaper comic strips published by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate.\"Planet of Kadril\"\"The Bounty Hunter of Ord Mantell\"\"The Final Trap\" Throughout the 1990s, he was a primary character in many of the novels and comics published by Bantam Spectra and Dark Horse Comics set after the events of Return of the Jedi. These stories saw him marry Princess Leia, sire three children, battle an extra-dimensional blob, become a Commodore in the New Republic military, and play a large role in bringing the Galactic Civil War to a close. However, when The New Jedi Order book series was being crafted in 1998 and 1999, its planning team felt that many of Bantams authors hadnt quite known what do with Solo. Solo was one of the stars of the nineteen-book series, first slipping into alcoholism and depression after the death of Chewbacca,The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught but gradually overcoming his grief and helping the galaxy repel the extragalactic invaders known as the Yuuzhan Vong. He has continued to be a major character in subsequent stories taking place up to 43.5 years after the events of the original Star Wars' film.\nAuthor A. C. Crispin wrote a trilogy of novels in 1998 about Han Solos youth. The trilogy built off of Daleys earlier books as well as several other works, consolidating many existing elements of the characters past while telling a story of its own.The Han Solo Trilogy hardcover Many of these elements, particularly ones originating in Daleys works, would show up in author James Lucenos Agents of Chaos Duology, two novels written in 2000 as part of The New Jedi Order. The duology focused heavily on Solo, owing to Lucenos desire to pay homage to Daley, who was a good friend of his and who had passed away in 1996. Luceno hoped for the duologys first installment, Hero's Trial, to be a \"Han Solo, this is your life\" novel. Luceno also wrote The New Jedi Order final chapter, The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force', and considered killing Solo in the book. Once again, however, Solo lived to see another day.\nSolos character has echoed Indiana Jones in several works. In Dark Nest I: The Joiner King, his line \"Bugs! Why did it have to be bugs?\" is a probable nod to Joness nearly identical line regarding snakes in Raiders of the Lost Ark.Raiders of the Lost Ark The Paradise Snare sees Solo adopt the alias \"Jenos Idanian\", an anagram of \"Indiana Jones\".\nSeveral unused concepts and shots of Solo exist within Star Wars film lore. The scene that sees Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the viewer first meet Solo and Chewbacca in the original film was at one point set to feature Solo sitting with and kissing a woman named Jenny.Jenny A young Han Solo was slated to appear on Kashyyyk in 2005s Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, living among the planets Wookiees as well as assisting Yoda. No actor was cast and the character was cut from the final draft.The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the SithThe Art of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith However, the concept was somewhat recycled in the non-canon LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace (where the character is voiced by Katie Leigh) and Jaybo Hood in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Mystery of a Thousand Moons.\"\n\n\u2022 Actor and author comments\n\nHarrison Ford\n]]\nHarrison Ford has referred to Solo as an inherently relatable character to audiences, owing to his separation from the overarching mythological themes of the saga. However, he saw Solo as a chess piece that could be moved around and even killed, as the character wasnt as important to Star Wars as its Force-using characters. Ford has called Solo a thin character, and one that wasnt interesting enough to be developed throughout several sequels, unlike Indiana Jones. As such, Ford thought that if Solo died in Return of the Jedi, it would introduce a needed complication for the character and give the story resonance.\nIn the words of George Lucas, Solo is \"a loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good.\"Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays James Luceno has identified Solo as one of his favorite characters to write, owing to the humanness of the character. Luceno feels that Solo has often been type-cast in novels, unable to grow and evolve in the same way as his Force-using family, and found the process of writing him as older, isolated, and grief-stricken during Agents of Chaos challenging. Author Troy Denning has similarly identified Solo as one of his favorite characters, due to his wit and his ability to always have a comeback.\n\n\u2022 Impact on popular culture\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy]]\nFollowing his appearances in the original trilogy, scores of Han Solo merchandise were produced, including a variety of action figures, as well as busts and soap. A Han Solo-themed mini fridge was proposed, but never made it past the pitch stage.\nIn 2005, Solo placed #14 on the list of greatest film heroes composed by the American Film Institute. The criteria involved in the listss selection included cultural impact, legacy and inspiration to contemporary artists and audiences, and heroism defined as prevailing in extreme circumstances coupled with a sense of morality, courage and purpose. Empire magazine deemed Solo the fourth greatest movie character of all time, citing him as full of charm and laconic cool that was brought by Harrison Ford. The magazine Entertainment Weekly ranked him at #7 on their list of the all-time coolest heroes in pop culture, and the website Fandomania.com placed him at #15 on their 2009 list of the 100 greatest fictional characters.\nThe developers of the 2008 video game Prince of Persia cited both Solo and Indiana Jones as having inspired their nameless protagonist.Steinman, Gary. \"Prince of Persia: Anatomy of a Prince\". PlayStation: The Official Magazine (December 2008). Actor Chris Pine also named both characters as sources he drew upon when preparing to play James T. Kirk in the 2009 film Star Trek, mentioning their humor and \"accidental hero\" traits.\nSolos likeness has been used in a variety of media, including the American television shows Mind of Mencia and Robot Chicken. In the cartoon Family Guy Star Wars-themed episodes Blue Harvest and Something, Something, Something, Dark Side, the character Peter Griffin plays the role of Solo. Mel Brookss 1987 Star Wars spoof Spaceballs' features a character named Captain Lonestar, who parodies both Solo and Skywalker.\n\n\u2022 Han shot first\n\nHan shot first\nHan Solo\nWhen George Lucas made a slight edit to one of Solos scenes for the 1997 Special Edition of the original Star Wars film, the change and its consequent fan response developed into somewhat of a pop culture meme. The original version of the film depicted Solo shooting the bounty hunter Greedo before Greedo could fire a shot of his own, but the Special Edition added in a laser blast from Greedo that preceded Solos shot but harmlessly hit the wall.The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition Many fans disapproved of the change, and an online petition that called for Lucas to re-release the original cut of the scene was signed by thousands. T-shirts were produced reading \"Han Shot First,\" and Lucas was even spotted wearing one on the set of the 2008 film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\nThe concept of Solo shooting first has been parodied in the dialogue of various Star Wars novels and video games,Star Wars: Battlefront II although Solo states that he enjoys shooting first, rather than second, in the 1979 novel Han Solo at Stars' End, written eighteen years prior to the release of the Star Wars Special Editions. The non-canon comic story \"The Emperors Court\" sees Solo argue with Greedos mother in court over who shot first.The Emperors Court Arguments over the subject appear in the films Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks II,Jay and Silent Bob Strike BackClerks II and a scene from the 2005 movie Serenity was inspired by the debate.Serenity DVD Audio Commentary When the original versions of the Star Wars trilogy were released on DVD in 2006, a promotional article on StarWars.com stated that fans could \"yes, see Han Solo shoot first.\"\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\nStar Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back' 2]]\nSolo has appeared in several Star Wars stories that fall outside of continuity. Each story operates independently of all others, existing in its own non-canon universe. One such story is \"Into the Great Unknown,\" a short comic which appeared in 2003s Star Wars Tales 19. Han Solo and Chewbacca flee from an Imperial fleet by executing a blind jump into hyperspace, and end up crashing the Millennium Falcon into the Pacific Northwest of the planet Earth. After leaving their downed ship to investigate their surroundings, Solo is killed by Native Americans. 126 years later, Indiana Jones and his partner Short Round investigate Solos corpse and the remains of the Falcon, and Jones dubs the scene \"eerily familiar\".Into the Great Unknown Author Haden Blackman has cited the story as one of the most fun Star Wars tales that he's attempted.\nAnother Tales comic which features Solo is \"Ghost,\" published in Star Wars Tales 11 in 2002. During the Dark Times, Solo is attempting to find a lost treasure and encounters the former Jedi Quinlan Vos. He later discovers that the treasure is Voss lightsaber. Star Wars Tales 14 features The Emperors Court, where Greedo's mother sues Solo for the murder of her son. Emperor Palpatine presides over the case as Solo argues the events of the Star Wars Special Edition and Greedo's mother claims the validity of the original version of the film. When she calls in Lak Sivrak, an alien who was removed from the cantina scene in the Special Edition, Solo questions his testimony by claiming that he wasn't actually present. Palpatine rules against Solo and sentences him to life imprisonment in carbonite. Solo also appears in the video game LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy.LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\nFrom 2001 to 2004, Dark Horse Comics published alternate takes on the original Star Wars trilogy, with each tale altering one pivotal moment in the film and exploring the hypothetical consequences. In Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope, Luke Skywalkers proton torpedoes detonate prematurely and fail to destroy the Death Star. Yavin 4 is destroyed by the battle stations superlaser, and the Millennium Falcon and Lukes X-wing flee through the debris field as Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader capture the escaping Rebel fleet.Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope 1 After rendezvousing in another system, Skywalker and R2-D2 abandon their battered X-wing and board the Falcon. When Solo tells Skywalker that the Rebellion is over, he is attacked by the emotionally heated youngster. Skywalker only stays his lightsaber blade when the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi appears and tells him to go to Dagobah. Solo gives Skywalker a ride on the Falcon, and lands the ship in the planets swamps without incident. Yoda appears and brings the group to his hut, where Solo alone realizes that the small green being is Yoda himself. He shares his discovery with his impatient companion, who goes on to train in the Jedi arts under Yoda while Solo and Chewbacca remain on the planet and tinker with the Falcon. After two months, the pair of smugglers depart the planet, promising to come back if Skywalker ever needs a lift.Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope 2\nFive years later, Solo and Chewbacca are at a cantina on Ord Mantell, and see a holovid of Princess Leia, now a servant of Darth Vader, addressing the citizens of the Empire from Coruscant. Infuriated, Solo breaks his chair over his table, and draws the attention of bounty hunters and Imperial stormtroopers. He and Chewie manage to reach the Falcon, and dodge an orbiting Imperial fleet en route to Dagobah. After once again arriving on the swamp world, Solo makes his way into the dark side cave as Skywalker is performing the final test of his Jedi training. He and Chewbacca then join Skywalker, Yoda, and R2-D2 for dinner, and inform Skywalker that Leia is alive. Yoda then reveals that Skywalker is the son of Vader and the sister of Leia, and the entire group prepares to depart for Coruscant.Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope 3\nAfter arriving at the Imperial throneworld, Solo drops Yoda and R2-D2 off on the Death Star, and leaves with the aid of a mind trick by Yoda. He and Skywalker then land onworld while Chewbacca keeps the Falcon airborne, and storm the Imperial Palace. As Leia wants them to find her, the only resistance they encounter is four Royal Guards armed with double-bladed lightsabers. Solo and Skywalker fight them off, and Solo strikes the final blow by seizing one of the lightsabers and stabbing a guard in the back. C-3PO then arrives and escorts them to Leias throne room, where she awaits with Vader and the Emperor. Reprogrammed to serve the Empire, the protocol droid places a blaster to Solos head and forces him to watch Skywalker duel his sister. Skywalker redeems Leia, and the Emperor begins casting Force lightning against them both before Vader turns on his master. Skywalker incapacitates C-3PO but forces Han to carry the droid, and the group cuts their way through stormtroopers before boarding the Falcon and fleeing the planet as Yoda crashes the Death Star into the Emperors Palace. Many years later, the group attends a ceremony electing Leia as Chancellor of the New Republic.Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope' 4\nIn Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back, when Solo finds Skywalker in a Hoth snowstorm, Skywalker dies in his arms, having been attacked by an additional Wampa in the cave. Skywalkers dying words tell Solo to go to Dagobah to train as a Jedi. The Empire catches the Rebels unaware during Skywalkers funeral, and Solo and Chewbacca take Princess Leia and the droids on the Falcon during the melee. Rather than fly into an asteroid field, they attach themselves to a Star Destroyer right away, and float away with the garbage to go to Cloud City and get their hyperdrive repaired. Lando Calrissian receives them, and discovers that Boba Fett followed them and arrived at the same time.Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 1 Solo and Chewbacca team up with Calrissian's forces to incapacitate Fett, and the bounty hunter is frozen in carbonite. With a repaired hyperdrive, Solo and his crew leave the planet to go to Dagobah.\nOn Dagobah, they come across Yoda, and Solo demands to be trained as a Jedi. When Yoda informs him that Skywalkers message was actually meant for Leia, he reluctantly departs, letting Leia begin her Jedi training. Solo and Chewbacca spend the next three months saving up enough credits to pay back Jabba the Hutt, and contact the smuggler Vilmarh Grahrk to deliver the funds from Mos Eisley. Grahrk betrays them to a team of Gand bounty hunters and takes their ship, and Solo, Chewbacca, and the droids are brought to Jabbas Palace. Solo and Chewbacca are thrown into a pit of Nexu, but are rescued when R2-D2 opens the pit door. Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2 escape while the Nexu overrun the Palace,Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 3 and return to Dagobah to see if Leia has completed her training. When they find her dueling Darth Vader, Solo and Chewbacca fire their blasters at his face, killing him. Yoda passes away and becomes one with the Force, and during Vaders funeral pyre, the surviving group declares that they have a galaxy to save.Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back' 4\nFinally, Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi sees Solo not released from carbonite until well after the events of Jabbas Palace.Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi 3 When the Hutt beheads C-3PO during negotiations with Leia in her bounty hunter disguise, Leia is left without a translator, and removes her helmet, causing a scene that ends with her thermal detonator activating and slipping from her fingers. She, Chewbacca, and Calrissian are able to escape as the Palace explodes, but fail to catch Boba Fett, who brings Solo aboard the Slave I and flees Tatooine. While pursuing him through the palace, Leia accidentally fires on Solos frozen form. After rendezvousing with Skywalker and R2-D2,Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi 1 they begin searching for Fett, eventually locating him in the Outer Rim. They recover Solo and steal the Slave I,Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi 2 and a medical team unfreezes Solo at the Rebel fleet near Sullust.\nThe blaster shot received from Leia causes Solo to be permanently blinded after being released from the carbonite. When a message arrives from Skywalker indicating that he has been captured by the Empire, Leia takes the Slave I to Endor to rescue him, and Solo joins Calrissian and Chewbacca on the Falcon as the Rebel Fleet follows her and strikes at the Death Star. Calrissian takes the Falcon to the moons surface, and when Chewbacca is injured by pursuing TIE fighters, Solo mans the guns, firing blindly as Calrissian aims them at the shield generator. Rebel ground forces have already weakened the generator, and Solos blasts finish the job. The Falcon then boards the Death Star to recover Skywalker, Leia, and a redeemed Darth Vader. After the station is destroyed, Vader joins the Rebel Fleet and efforts are begun to track down the Emperor, Han now wearing a helmet that is apparently intended to compensate for his lost eyesight.Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi 4\nHear Han Solo\nHan Solo and Chewbacca appeared in the ambiguously canon scenario for Star Wars Miniatures, The Theft of Vaders Helmet, in which they infiltrate the Executor to steal Darth Vaders helmet sometimes during Admiral Pietts captaincy of the Executor.\nIn the Battle of Endor DLC for Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, Darth Vader sends the Dark Apprentice to stop the rebels from destroying the shield generator bunker protecting the second Death Star. As the Dark Apprentice approached the bunker, Han Solo told Chewbacca they must buy time for Princess Leia to set the bombs to destroy the bunker. Chewbacca engaged the Dark Apprentice with a stolen AT-ST while Han took shots at him with a rocket launcher. Despite assistance from the Ewoks, they were unable to defeat him. The Dark Apprentice heavily damaged the walker, then incapacitated Chewbacca and lifted him into the air with one hand. Han attempted to save his friend by firing two shots from his blaster, only for the Dark Apprentice to use Chewbacca as a shield, killing him much to Hans horror. Enraged, Han opened fire with his blaster, but the Dark Apprentice easily deflected the shots with his lightsaber, then lifted him into the air with the Force and impaled him, killing Han. As a result of Han and Chewbaccas failure, the Dark Apprentice was able to destroy the bombs and kill Leia, resulting in the Empire's victory over the Rebel Alliance.\nOn July 22 2011, Han made an appearance in LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace as a young boy who escapes an orphanage and ends up joining Yoda in a quest to recover stolen battle plans from the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\n\u2022 Translations\n\n\u2022 In the Italian version of the original trilogy, Han is called Ian Solo or (in the subtitles) Jan Solo.\n\n\u2022 In the French version of the original trilogy, Han is called Yan Solo.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\nLEGO Star Wars: Microfighters video game]]\n\u2022 Bantha Shakes\n\n\u2022 Escape from the Jedi Temple\n\n\u2022 Race for the Holocrons\n\n\u2022 Raid on Coruscant\n\n\u2022 Clash of the Skywalkers\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Detours canceled\n\n\u2022 The Epic Continues Canceled\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Lords of Nal Hutta\n\n\u2022 Fly Casual\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Strongholds of Resistance\n\n\u2022 Keeping the Peace\n\n\u2022\n\nDooles Defense Fleet]]\nDooles Defense Fleet]]\n11 ABY]]&mdash;\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Han Solo\n\n\u2022 Han Solo",

A typical Yuuzhan Vong resembled a [[Human/Legends|Human]] in form, though they were taller and heavier than the average Human and had less hair on their heads. The Yuuzhan Vong were religious zealots, who viewed mechanical technology as [[Anti-droid sentiment/Legends|blasphemy]]. Their technological innovations were genetically engineered and purely organic. Additionally, the Yuuzhan Vong deeply respected pain to the point of sadomasochism and strove to improve their physical capabilities through [[organ grafting]]. Such grafting was a status symbol within Yuuzhan Vong society.\n\nPerhaps most notably, the Yuuzhan Vong were unable to be sensed through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. This confounded the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] who first encountered the Yuuzhan Vong. However, they were susceptible to some Force based attacks.\n\n==Biology and appearance==\n{{Quote|The Yuuzhan Vong was tall, muscular, and humanlike, but his face and body were horribly scarred and disfigured. He had no hair, and his nose was practically missing. He was horrible to behold.|Garqi refugee|<ref name=\"EGtAS\">[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]</ref>}}\n[[File:YuuzhanVongWarrior-NJOS.png|thumb|left|180px|A Yuuzhan Vong warrior]]\nThe Yuuzhan Vong were a [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] [[Species/Legends|species]]&mdash;initially leading some to believe that they were a [[Human/Legends|Human]] offshoot race&mdash;but there were differences between Humans and Yuuzhan Vong. For example, Yuuzhan Vong typically lacked [[Kidney/Legends|kidneys]].<ref name=\"Ylesia\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Ylesia]]''</ref> The Yuuzhan Vong were also much taller and had heavier builds than the average Human, though this could be a result of selective breeding.<ref name=\"VP\" /> Yuuzhan Vong also had an average lifespan of 76 standard years,<ref name=\"LECG\" /> but their maximum lifespan was two to three times that of an average Human's.<ref name=\"UF\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref> Genetically, they shared many elements that made them similar to Humans, which was considered unusual as they were an extragalactic species, but one notable difference was one element of their genetic structure that was present in all their biotechnology.<ref name=\"DW\" />\n\nYuuzhan Vong had sloping, almost ridge-like foreheads. Several Yuuzhan Vong had been seen with pointed ears, while just as many had been seen without them. These could have been ritual mutilations, or a genetic variation; there is no conclusive evidence as to what the species' norm was. Yuuzhan Vong also had short, stub-like noses, making their faces appear skull-like.<ref name=\"VP\" /> The Yuuzhan Vong usually had black hair, though in lesser amounts on both the head and body than Humans, but often wore it much longer than them (in many cases, they were also completely bald). Small blue sacks could be found under the eyes of the Yuuzhan Vong, and they were often considered a mark of beauty.<ref name=\"DW\" /> These eyesacks expanded and contracted to reflect a Yuuzhan Vong's mood, as the species did not use the facial expressions preferred by Humans.<ref name=\"SbS\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''</ref> Through the blue sacks under their eyes, they were capable of telling if an individual was in delight or were suffering from rage.<ref name=\"FHIII:R\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion]]''</ref> The most common skin tone among the Yuuzhan Vong was gray, with the second most common being yellow. Another major characteristic was their jet black blood.<ref name=\"SbS\" />\n\n[[File:YuuzhanVongdatabank.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Yuuzhan Vong's face]]\nThe Yuuzhan Vong nervous system was very conductive, as if it was made specifically for feeling pain.<ref name=\"BP\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''</ref> This nervous system was noted as containing aspects that were not found in Humans and likewise, there were elements within a Human nervous system that were not found in a Yuuzhan Vong. It was also noted that their tissue was very different from a Human's, which made the use of the Yuuzhan Vong Qah cells difficult on them as the Human brain eventually rejected the cells.<ref name=\"FP\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Vong-rpg.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A Yuuzhan Vong warrior]]\nPerhaps the most notable and most disturbing (to Jedi and other dwellers of the galaxy) trait of the Yuuzhan Vong was that they were outside of the Force as the Jedi knew it. They had no Force presence that could be sensed, and were unaffected by most Force powers that were targeted directly at them. This meant that any attempt to sense their motivation, truthfulness or determine their next course of action were futile, although it did mean that one was capable of detecting them by reaching out in the Force and determining if the person had no presence within it.<ref name=\"EoVI:C\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]''</ref> Even a normally powerful telekinetic blast that was capable of launching an ordinary opponent off their feet at high speeds simply caused a Yuuzhan Vong either to stumble, or lose balance temporarily.<ref name=\"EoVII:R\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''</ref> While it was mostly impossible to affect the Yuuzhan Vong directly through the use of the Force, it was possible to use indirect means to accomplish such a task, such as manipulating an object through telekinesis and throwing it at a Yuuzhan Vong, which would injure them, or by controlling the air in an attempt to increase the pressure, thus allowing a Jedi to, in effect, crush the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"EoVI:C\" /> The only known Force techniques that seemed somehow exempt from this limitation were variations on [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]/[[Electric Judgment|Emerald lightning]], the dark side technique [[Force net]], [[Dark transfer|Dark Transfer]], and to an extent [[Shatterpoint/Legends|Shatterpoint]].<ref name=\"TUF\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref><ref name=\"SbS\" /><ref name=\"L15\">[[Legacy (2006) 15|''Legacy'' (2006) 15]]</ref><ref name=\"L19\">[[Legacy (2006) 19|''Legacy'' (2006) 19]]</ref>\n\nA small number of Jedi developed another ability, the [[Vongsense]]. In some ways, this ability worked similarly to the Force, especially the detection and telepathic aspects of the Force, but only relating to the Yuuzhan Vong and their biots.<ref name=\"T\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Traitor]]''</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:LEGYVMF.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A female and male Yuuzhan Vong]]\nYuuzhan Vong culture was centered around sacrifice and their gods, although warriors in particular were centered on the philosophy of pain. They tended to glorify pain; not as a motive for action, but rather as a state of living. This was because they believed that, just like their gods had sacrificed their bodies to create the galaxy, the Yuuzhan Vong themselves were to sacrifice parts of their body for a greater purpose. As such, they believed that, by remaking their own bodies, they were becoming closer to their deities. While this was the case, they never maimed their bodies in a manner that would permanently hinder their ability to function.<ref name=\"EGtAS\" /> This resulted in individual Yuuzhan Vong having mottling or scarring, and sweeping tattoos. The more elite individuals were even known to graft organs from other creatures into their bodies. Devotional practices to the gods called for bloodletting at prayer times. [[Shamed Ones]] were forbidden from attending religious ceremonies.<ref name=\"UF\" />\n\nAs a Yuuzhan Vong grew more successful in their life, they began the process of sacrificing body parts and replacing them with organs from another creature, thus enhancing their abilities. This was done so during the [[Escalation|Escalatier Ceremony]], where an engineered organism related to an [[Implanter]] began to make cuts and incisions, and place the implants. At times, the implant was accepted into the body and the Yuuzhan Vong was promoted to a higher rank.<ref name=\"AoCII:JE\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''</ref> However, there were occasions where the implant failed to be accepted into the body. This resulted either in death or the individual becoming a derided Shamed One. Such failures were believed to have been the work of the Yuuzhan Vong gods, though there were times that such a happenstance was due to the failure of the Shaper in charge of the Escalation ceremony.<ref name=\"DW\" />\n\nFamily was noted as being a strong element within their society.<ref name=\"FHII:R\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]''</ref> A member of the Yuuzhan Vong was typically associated with a family group, known typically as a [[Domain]]. Some Domains were more powerful than others. In addition to this family structure, the Yuuzhan Vong also employed a caste based system which included respective castes for warriors, shapers, priests, intendants and workers. Love affairs between two different castes was considered forbidden.<ref name=\"EoVI:C\" /> In fact, domain loyalties ran deep, and went far beyond simple likes or dislikes.<ref name=\"FP\" /> There were a series of ritual statements that a Yuuzhan Vong was required to utter as part of protocol from a member of lower ranks to a member of a higher rank.<ref name=\"ELI:RD\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref> While this was the case, members of one caste were not obligated to salute a superior from another caste, which was the case with intendants to higher ranking members of the warrior caste.<ref name=\"AoCII:JE\" />\n\n[[File:YuuzhanVongUAA.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Two members of the Yuuzhan Vong species]]\nYuuzhan Vong children were raised in caste-specific cr\u00e8ches by designated caretakers, and likely did not know their biological parents until they were older. Their cr\u00e8che parents named them. Deformed children were killed at birth, but, if the deformity was mild enough, as was the case with one [[Ona Shai]], the child was spared.<ref name=\"EoVII:R\" /> A useful survival trait for these children in order to live through such a harsh and competitive environment was paranoia.<ref name=\"FP\" /> Twin births were uncommon events; only a handful of cases were known to the New Republic, in which each was thought to be a portent of a great event. In each case, one twin killed the other as a prelude to a great destiny.<ref name=\"DJ\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]''</ref> Funeral processions were typically carried out in a way that did not preserve the dead, and Yuuzhan Vong mortuaries often consisted of Yuuzhan Vong mourners who met with assigned priests. During such conditions, priests were involved in removing various body parts of the dead in order to dedicate them to the various gods.<ref name=\"SbS\" />\n\nAccording to the insights of an Imperial [[Jagged Fel|officer]], the Empire and the Yuuzhan Vong had some elements that were common to one another. These included the need for strict discipline and the obedience to one's superior officer. However, at the time of the invasion, it was believed that their ultimate goals were completely different, with the Yuuzhan Vong desiring to change the way of life of the inhabitants of the galaxy. One of their goals was the destruction and removal of all forms of manufactured technology, which was one of the key strengths of the [[Imperial Remnant]].<ref name=\"DW\" /> This great belief in discipline and obedience in one's superiors meant that subordinates never contradicted their leaders; they were capable of subverting or altering the will of their commanders, but did not point out errors in that will.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> They were ultimately highly skilled warriors who never retreated in the face of defeat, as they feared this would insult their gods.<ref name=\"EGtAS\" /> While this was largely the case, it was known that certain Yuuzhan Vong were capable of cowardly actions. For actions like this, they became Shamed Ones.<ref name=\"FHI:R\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant]]''</ref>\n\nYuuzhan Vong beliefs highly influenced their actions and personality. According to their [[True Way|religion]], life was suffering, and death was the ultimate release from that suffering. As such, the Yuuzhan Vong felt that nothing could be learned unless it was purchased in pain, and were resigned to and willingly went to their deaths. Some amongst their race, such as [[Domain Shai]], went as far as to inflict pain on themselves to the point that they enjoyed it. Such groups felt that the infliction of pain was a means of earning the favor of their deities.<ref name=\"T\" /> Furthermore, it was believed that the greatest glory was death in battle.<ref name=\"VP\" /> This fixation on death varied depending on the circumstances, as dying in the cold void between galaxies was considered a disgraceful death.<ref name=\"EoVII:R\" /> Consequently, this meant that most Yuuzhan Vong fought to the death and thus also meant that other empires had very few opportunities of exploring the extragalactic aliens' organic warships.<ref name=\"FHIII:R\" /> In addition, the priests claimed that they did not ask of others what they themselves did not accomplish, meaning that they equally sacrificed their own numbers as well as ''\"infidels\"''. This was an act of service to their deities, who were believed to have sacrificed their body parts in order to create all of existence.<ref name=\"AoCI:HT\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref>\n\nThe species also greatly believed in honor, with that subject ranking quite high in the beliefs of certain members of the race. Even under interrogations, the word of a Yuuzhan Vong was high, and, if they promised respite to their victims for revealing information, they typically kept their word.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> In one case, a [[Shedao Shai|Yuuzhan Vong commander]] agreed to a personal duel over the fate of a [[Ithor/Legends|planet]] and, if defeated, he agreed that his forces would spare that world. While the Yuuzhan Vong himself was sincere, his subordinates worked with the Warmaster to subvert that honorable combat.<ref name=\"DTII:R\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref> Furthermore, the denial of the right to honorable combat was seen as a disrespectful act, worthy of scorn from the warrior caste.<ref name=\"EoVII:R\" /> In fact, warriors would even consider a single worthy opponent of fighting a single Yuuzhan Vong warrior at a time worthy of respect in regard to their bravery as well as their fighting skills.<ref name=\"T\" /> There also existed a similar concept to the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Life debt/Legends|Life debt]], which was known as [[Us-hrok]]. This was a display that showed eternal gratitude and loyalty to another for something they had done, and meant that the Yuuzhan Vong in question would fight to the death on that person's behalf.<ref name=\"FHIII:R\" /> In regards to food, the Yuuzhan Vong held no great joy of eating and thus felt indifferent about gastronomic tastes. The only exception of this was if the enjoyment came from an event such as the slaying of a great beast during a ritual.<ref name=\"FP\" />\n\n[[File:InvasionYuuzhanVong.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yuuzhan Vong onboard their living ships]]\nThe psychology of the Yuuzhan Vong during wartime engagements was based around attack, and involved the use of high levels of aggression. This made them dangerous, though at times their actions were somewhat predictable.<ref name=\"DW\" /> The Yuuzhan Vong were often encouraged by an enemy's resistance to them and tended to see such foes as being worthy of fighting.<ref name=\"AoCII:JE\" /> Internally, the Yuuzhan Vong greatly believed in the concept of competition as a means of breeding strength. However, this had the side effect of bringing about internal feuds between Domains and castes, who would attempt to escalate their positions above their kin. This resulted in civil war in the past, and it was believed that the [[Yuuzhan Vong War|Invasion]] would allow the Yuuzhan Vong an external enemy to fight, but after some time the same divisions began to appear once more. They also believed deeply in the concept of revenge, and had no reservations to the use of aggressive emotions&mdash;unlike the Jedi. This often meant that the Yuuzhan Vong engaged in suicide attacks or ritual suicides when facing defeat in order to attain glory, which was a source of pride of the warrior caste.<ref name=\"FP\" /> This aggressive and warlike nature meant that they did not have any concept of peace or remorse. In their language, peace meant the willing submission to a conqueror.<ref name=\"BP\" /> Furthermore, within their society, the use of profanities meant that the individual in question was capable of calling out a blood challenge to his opponent; the two would fight in a battle to the death. In addition, the use of particular insulting words, such as calling the other a ''\"fool\"'', meant that the wounded party was perfectly within their rights and even expected by their comrades to kill their opponent.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> This meant that an attack on a Yuuzhan Vong's pride was the grounds for demanding satisfaction, which was also capable of being accepted as a sacrifice to their gods.<ref name=\"EGtAS\" />\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong had a fanatical hatred of machines, believing them to be abominations and an affront to their gods. According to their beliefs at the time of the Invasion, they believed that combustion, the creation of fire through a machine, was the first abomination.<ref name=\"EoVI:C\" /> This was because the Yuuzhan Vong believed deeply in life, but also felt that all life ended as in the wild; one type of lifeform was eaten by another, who in turn was devoured by another predator until it died, which replenished the ecosystem. This meant that death was prevalent constantly, but allowed new life to grow while machines did not die, meaning that they were capable of replacing organic life&mdash;which was something the Yuuzhan Vong would never allow.<ref name=\"FP\" />\n\nThe species possessed a saying: ''\"Let the enemy fight\"'', which was one of the aspects of their racial psychology. They often expected combat and arranged ambushes for their enemies, after which they baited targets into their traps. Their interdiction forces often remained outside their designated routes in order to jump onto a target, thus trapping them as a type of ambush. Another saying included ''\"A fleet that fights two battles loses twice.\"''<ref name=\"SbS\" /> Ultimately, the Yuuzhan Vong's earlier relations with other races was based on domination of the lesser species, as they felt most other races were unworthy. Those that managed to impress the Yuuzhan Vong and were considered worthy were often provided a clean death while the others were relegated to slavery.<ref name=\"RGRCR\">''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook]]''</ref>\n\nDespite elements of their society which were seen as being barbaric, the Yuuzhan Vong truly revered life and all its forms. Among the few ''infidel'' races of the 'Promised Land', they tended to favor the [[Ho'Din/Legends|Ho'Din]], whose natural senses meant that they did not like the presence of advanced technology.<ref name=\"UF\" /> Some primitive races who did not make use of technology were also known to have willingly allied with the Yuuzhan Vong, such as some of the inhabitants of Wayland. These ''\"Wish-To-Bes\"'' believed that the Yuuzhan Vong were like them in that they respected life, while the majority believed that this was not true, as the ''\"Cut-Up-People\"'' simply wished to harm as well as twist things to suit their needs.<ref name=\"EotV\">\"[[Emissary of the Void]]\"</ref> According to their religion, they had to prove themselves worthy creations of their deities, and if they did not do so then they would be destroyed&mdash;after which they would be replaced by a more worthy species. Their beliefs stated that this had happened three times in their religion, with a new species created, eventually leading to the gods creating the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"UF\" />\n\nIn the post-War period, the Yuuzhan Vong became a deeply spiritual as well as introspective people. Many felt that they would never be able to mend relations with the inhabitants of the galaxy due to the Yuuzhan Vong War, though a few heroic members of this race believed that they needed to evolve in order to survive. Thus, they felt that the journey to better relations was one that was worth the effort.<ref name=\"LECG\" /> They still retained their different form of honor in this age, with both custom and ritual still being an important aspect of their culture.<ref name=\"SW:L:G\">''[[Star Wars: Legacy: Ghosts]]''</ref>\n\n==Society description==\n===Supreme Overlord===\n{{Main|Supreme Overlord}}\nThe highest caste was Supreme Overlord, who had control over all other castes.<ref name=\"The Essential Guide to Warfare\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref>\n\n===Priest caste===\n{{Main|Priest caste}}\n[[File:Vongpriest1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A priest]]\nThe priest caste was considerably powerful in the Yuuzhan Vong's rigidly theocratic society. The members of the priest caste served the many lesser deities that ruled the Yuuzhan Vong. There were several sects, each for the worship of a different Yuuzhan Vong deity. Ranks of the priest caste included the [[Mosthigh priest]], [[High Priest/Legends|High Priest]](ess), [[Priest/Legends|Priest]](ess), and [[Seer (Yuuzhan Vong rank)|Seer]].\n\n===Warrior caste===\n{{Main|Warrior caste}}\n[[File:Yuuzhan-vong-eu2_bg.jpg|thumb|left|130px|A Yuuzhan Vong warrior]]\nThe warrior caste served as the armies of the Yuuzhan Vong and was one of the largest castes who essentially served as the military branch of their race. Members of the caste were trained from an early age to excel in combat. Warriors were also more aggressive than other Yuuzhan Vong. Notable members of this caste included [[Tsavong Lah]] and [[Nas Choka]], both of whom became Warmaster of the Yuuzhan Vong at various points. Their chief weapon was the [[amphistaff]], which resembled a deadly serpent capable of spitting venom or coiling around foes. The warriors were devotees of the Slayer, Yun-Yammka, and sought honor in combat. They wore the living [[Vonduun Skerr Kyrric|vonduun crab armor]] which was capable of resisting blaster fire or lightsabers. This armor did have weak points, such as points at the armpit and areas of the inner hip where the shell's segments joined.\n\nRanks of the warrior caste included the [[Warmaster]], [[Supreme Commander (Yuuzhan Vong rank)|Supreme Commander]], [[Commander/Legends|Commander]], [[Subaltern]], and [[Warrior caste|Warrior]].\n\n===Intendant caste===\n{{Main|Intendant caste}}\nThe Intendant caste worked to keep Yuuzhan Vong society functioning and was as such responsible for the Yuuzhan Vong economy. They were noted as being the smallest of the castes who lacked a patron deity or a specific war cry when compared to the others. It was this caste that were in charge of matters of commerce, bureaucracy, trade and the management of the sizable slave work force employed by the Yuuzhan Vong. Notable Intendants included [[Nom Anor]], the deadliest enemy of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. Members of the Intendant Caste could come from either the Shaper or Warrior castes. [[Shimrra Jamaane]] was formerly an Intendant, before becoming Supreme Overlord. They were the government and politicians and favored [[Yun-Harla]] the Trickster godess.\n\nRanks of the Intendant caste included [[High Prefect]], [[Prefect (Yuuzhan Vong rank)|Prefect]], [[Consul/Legends|Consul]], [[Executor (Yuuzhan Vong rank)|Executor]], and [[Attendant (Yuuzhan Vong rank)|Attendant]].\n\n===Worker caste===\n{{Main|Worker caste}}\nThe worker caste was the largest, yet lowest, caste and served mainly as servants, slaves and laborers. The worker caste included [[Shamed Ones]], Yuuzhan Vong whose bodies had rejected any organic implants and modifications, Yuuzhan Vong born outright into the worker caste, Yuuzhan Vong who had failed to succeed in other castes, and conquered or shaped species such as the [[Chazrach]]. Slaves and the Shamed Ones (fallen members of society) were part of the worker castes, but they were treated with contempt even by their fellow workers, though Yuuzhan Vong born into the worker caste were actually descended from Shamed Ones.\n\n==Deities==\n{{Quote|All living creatures serve the Yuuzhan Vong. And we serve the gods.|Tsavong Lah|<ref name=\"BP\" />}}\nThe Yuuzhan Vong religion, called the [[True Way]], was very important to the Yuuzhan Vong. They were devout and had many gods and, prior to their defeat, believed it was their duty to appease their gods' desires through conquest and genocide.\n\n===Yun-Yuuzhan===\n{{Main|Yun-Yuuzhan}}\nYun-Yuuzhan, the creator, was the most powerful deity of the Yuuzhan Vong religion. He sacrificed most of his body parts to create the lesser deities and the Yuuzhan Vong galaxy. Only the Supreme Overlord had direct contact with him.\n\n===Yun-Harla===\n{{Main|Yun-Harla}}\nYun-Harla was the Trickster, the Cloaked Goddess and goddess of deception and aggression. Yun-Harla represented the political caste. Having learned this information, the New Republic military had their top pilot, [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]], codenamed \"Trickster\" and \"Goddess\" in an act of psychological warfare against the Yuuzhan Vong invaders, who would believe they were fighting the living form of one of their most powerful deities.\n\n===Yun-Yammka===\n{{Main|Yun-Yammka}}\nYun-Yammka was the Slayer, and the god of war. His image was of a multi-tentacled being, and was the inspiration for the form of the [[yammosk]]. He was primarily worshipped by the warrior caste. He was in actuality created by the priest caste when the Yuuzhan Vong turned to war.\n\n===Yun-Ne'Shel===\n{{Main|Yun-Ne'Shel}}\nYun-Ne'Shel was the Modeler. She oversaw natural life cycles and was worshiped by the shaper caste.\n\n===Yun-Txiin and Yun-Q'aah (The Lover Gods)===\n{{Main|Yun-Txiin|Yun-Q'aah}}\nYun-Txiin and Yun-Q'aah were the Lover Gods and twins. Having a relationship outside one's caste was forbidden in Yuuzhan Vong society, and disobeying automatically led to sacrifice to the Lover Gods.\n\n===Yun-Shuno===\n{{Main|Yun-Shuno}}\nYun-Shuno was the Pardoner. She had a thousand eyes and watched over and spoke for the Shamed Ones, who were shunned by every other Yuuzhan Vong deity. She was the only deity the Shamed Ones were allowed to worship.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n{{Main|Ur-Yuuzhan Vong}}\n{{Quote|The ancient texts are unclear. It appears we were invaded by a race that was more technological than animate.

Their original homeworld, [[Yuuzhan'tar]] was a tropical planet that had a large asteroid belt around it. It was destroyed thousands of standard years before they invaded the galaxy.\n\nIn [[Yuuzhan Vong (language)|Yuuzhan Vong]], Yuuzhan'tar meant \"Cr\u00e8che of the gods\", and the living planet was a template for the Yuuzhan Vong deities. Yuuzhan'tar may have been the basis for [[Yun-Yuuzhan]], the creator god of the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"UF\" />\n\nLittle was known about their early history, but the Yuuzhan Vong had apparently once lived as symbiotes with their homeworld and were [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]]. Their technology was also largely organic. At some point in their history, the Yuuzhan Vong were caught in the midst of a [[Silentium\u2013Abominor War|devastating galactic conflict]] between two [[Droid/Legends|droid]] civilizations&mdash;believed to be the [[Silentium]] and the [[Abominor]]&mdash;which solidified their hatred of mechanical technology and [[Speciesism|xenophobia]] towards other sentient lifeforms.<ref name=\"NEGtD\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]''</ref>\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong's living homeworld aided them in the war by bestowing upon them the knowledge of creating living weapons. However, as the war dragged on, the Yuuzhan Vong as a species became increasingly violent and warlike. Eventually, they were able to defeat their enemies, and forced both droid powers to flee their galaxy.\n\nFollowing the war, the Yuuzhan Vong went on a crusade to cleanse their galaxy of all forms of mechanical technology. They conquered much of their galaxy and either exterminated or enslaved conquered species. Among those species they conquered were the reptilian [[Chazrach]], which became slave soldiers for the Yuuzhan Vong.\n\nWith much of the galaxy in their hands, the various [[Domain]]s (what the Yuuzhan Vong called clans or families) fractured and turned against each other, resulting in the devastating [[Cremlevian War]]. During the conflict, much of the Yuuzhan Vong's galaxy was destroyed, including their homeworld, Yuuzhan'tar. The exact details of the destruction of the planet were lost to the passage of time. However, Yuuzhan'tar did produce a seed which eventually became [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]], later colonized by the [[Langhesi]] and [[Ferroan]]s.\n\nSeparated from their original symbiosis with their homeworld, the Yuuzhan Vong were stripped from the Force, and experienced great pain. Thus, the species saw pain as the only way to return to that symbiosis and practiced body modifications on themselves. In place of their homeworld, the Yuuzhan Vong took up belief in [[Yun'o|several deities]], which subsequently governed nearly every aspect of their civilization.\n[[File:Worldship-NEGVV.png|thumb|left|180px|The Yuuzhan Vong made the exodus from their galaxy onboard their great Worldships.]]\nTowards the end of the war, [[Steng]] emerged as the first [[Warmaster]]. A rival Warmaster, [[Yo'gand]], invented the [[Yo'gand's Core]] tactic, which he used to destroy the planet [[Ygziir]] and its moon. The [[Battle of Ygziir|destruction of Ygziir]] resulted in the death of Steng and the end of the war. Eventually, Yo'gand united the Domains into a single socio-political entity and became the first [[Supreme Overlord]] of the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"VP\" />\n\nWith much of their galaxy ruined, the Yuuzhan Vong began a long trek to [[The galaxy/Legends|another galaxy]] in search of a new home. For a long period, perhaps centuries, the species was forced to travel through the [[Intergalactic Void]] in massive [[Koros-Strohna|worldships]]. During this period, the Yuuzhan Vong nearly destroyed themselves. Violence and competition had been inevitably built into their society and, without an external target, they focused their aggression against each other. Though there were no all out wars in the magnitude of the Cremlevian War, the Domains continued to fight each other for the favor of the Supreme Overlords.\n\n===Pre-invasion===\n{{Quote|There's an invasion coming.

In that year, a group of [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Neo-Crusaders]] under the command of [[Canderous Ordo]] encountered what would later come to be known as a [[Yorik-stronha]], disguised as an asteroid in the [[Crispin system]], while chasing a group of pirates in the system's asteroid belt. When Ordo used a thermal generator to melt the frozen methane covering the \"asteroid\", the Yorik-Stronha, in Ordo's words, \"woke up\". The asteroid began to spin quickly and then proceeded to fire plasma at the Mandalorians. The extragalactic weaponry was able to melt through the Mandalorian's armor \"like wax\". The attack on the Mandalorians became the \"first contact\" with the Known Galaxy. The probe fled soon after the brief battle with Ordo's Mandalorians. Ordo followed in hot pursuit, but was unable to keep up with the probe. The Mandalorians were able to track the probe's [[Hyperspace wake/Legends|hyperspace wake]] to the edge of the galaxy, where the Neo-Crusaders turned back, apparently thinking that the mysterious ship was going on a suicide run into the great void outside the galaxy.<ref name=\"SW:KotOR\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''</ref> Also in this general time frame, a [[Unidentified female Yuuzhan Vong Shaper|female Shaper]] arrived in the galaxy in [[Suspended animation/Legends|suspended animation]], crashing on [[Lorrd/Legends|Lorrd]] and surviving there for several decades, interacting with locals who believed her to be a [[Demon/Legends|demon]].<ref name=\"DitSPoL\">{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/fiction/feature20090531/index.html?page=1|text=Death in the Slave Pits of Lorrd: A Hyperspace Exclusive|int=Death in the Slave Pits of Lorrd}}</ref>\n\nBetween [[229 BBY/Legends|229]] and [[89 BBY]], the living planet [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]]&mdash;a [[Reproduction/Legends|seed]] of Yuuzhan'tar&mdash;arrived in the [[Gardaji Rift]].<ref name=\"RP\">''[[Rogue Planet]]''</ref> In [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]], a [[Unidentified Yuuzhan Vong (Cog Hive Seven)|Yuuzhan Vong]] was captured and ended up in [[Cog Hive Seven]], a prison colony wherein deadly gladiatorial matches regularly took place between inmates. The Yuuzhan Vong, who had already killed two fellow inmates in transit to the colony, quickly emerged as the station's most recent champion. For six months, the warrior systematically defeated every opponent pitted against the Yuuzhan Vong, until the champion was matched with [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]], who was on an undercover mission on Cog Hive Seven. After a brutal fight, (where the Sith was under orders to not use the Force and, of course, could not passively sense anything of his foe's planned moves) Maul killed the warrior. As the Yuuzhan Vong had only spoken in the species' native language, the colony's systems had failed to classify its species, point of origin, or even gender, although some of the guards suspected that the individual was a female.<ref name=\"Lockdown\">''[[Maul: Lockdown]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], at the time of the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an advance force of Yuuzhan Vong&mdash;termed \"Far Outsiders\" by the planet's inhabitants&mdash;discovered Zonama, and noting the similarity to Yuuzhan'tar (though not drawing the connection) attempted to colonize it. However, when the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to settle, Zonama Sekot's biosphere killed off the Yuuzhan Vong flora and fauna, provoking them. Although Sekot attempted to negotiate with them, they began an [[First Battle of Zonama Sekot|assault upon the planet]]. After two years of costly fighting, the assault was called off with the arrival of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Vergere]], who convinced the Yuuzhan Vong to leave on the condition that she would travel with them. The [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] received only shadowy news at the attack; even after Jedi Knight [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] went to investigate Vergere's disappearance, all that they discovered was that an unknown race of biotech-based aliens from a distant place and armed with weapons that the planet's inhabitants had never seen before had attacked the world.<ref name=\"RP\" />\n\nIn [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]], after learning of Zonama Sekot, [[Supreme Overlord]] [[Quoreal]]'s determination to invade began to waver. The Yuuzhan Vong soon learned that Zonama Sekot was no longer in its original system, and there was no evidence that it had been destroyed. Worried about the threat presented by the powerful planetary entity, he announced to his people that it would be best to move on to another galaxy. However, [[Shimrra Jamaane]], under the influence of [[Onimi]] and with the support of some of the more aggressive domains, launched a [[Jamaane coup|coup]], murdered Quoreal and took his place, ensuring that the invasion would go forth as planned. But it would still be some time before they were ready.<ref name=\"UF\" />\n\nInformation of Yuuzhan Vong activity within the galaxy for the next few decades is scarce. It is known that, by [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]], at the start of the [[Outbound Flight Project]], [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] had somehow gained knowledge of the incoming Yuuzhan Vong fleet, though he planned to withhold it from the Republic until after his [[New Order/Legends|New Order]] could be instituted. At least one of his subordinates, [[Kinman Doriana/Legends|Kinman Doriana]], was informed, however. The distant threat of invasion was also part of the reason Palpatine ordered [[Battle for Outbound Flight|the destruction]] of ''[[Outbound Flight]]'' in order to prevent its occupants from falling into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong (and also to eliminate six Jedi Masters and twelve Jedi Knights).<ref name=\"OF\" /> Following the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] Palpatine let out hints of the Yuuzhan Vong to the public. One of his official justifications for maintaining the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] even after the war had ended was to ward off the threat of extra-galactic invasion.<ref name=\"RotS:ICS\">''[[Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref>\n\nIt was also around this time that another small [[Yuuzhan Vong reconnaissance force|reconnaissance force]] of Yuuzhan Vong [[Battle between the Chiss and Yuuzhan Vong|engaged]] the [[Chiss Defense Fleet]], on the edge of the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]]. Although the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Ar'alani/Legends|Ar'alani]] managed to defeat them, the Yuuzhan Vong fought much better than the Chiss had believed such a small fleet was capable of. The appearance of the ''Outbound Flight'' shortly afterwards led the CEDF high command to wonder for a short time if the invaders and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] were allies.<ref name=\"OF\" />\n\nSometime between 27 BBY and [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], it was speculated by some Chiss that the Yuuzhan Vong had made a pact with the [[Vagaari/Legends|Vagaari]] against the Chiss.<ref name=\"SQ\">''[[Survivor's Quest]]''</ref>\n\nYuuzhan Vong scouts returned dozens of kidnapped sentients to the fleet from the galaxy.

He was also responsible for infecting [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] and a hundred other diplomats with a deadly Yuuzhan Vong disease. As a result the New Republic did not take notice when the first of the invasion force, the [[Praetorite Vong]], made planetfall on the distant world of [[Helska IV]] and also brought down [[Sernpidal/Legends|Sernpidal's]] moon upon the planet, killing millions of beings including the famous [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], and leaving the planet itself in pieces. The Yuuzhan Vong also encountered the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], whom they started to consider the worst of a galaxy full of infidels, due in no small part to the Jedi's ability to control a supernatural force that Yuuzhan Vong had been denied. The Praetorite Vong were eventually [[Battle of Helska IV|defeated]] by galactic heroes [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], [[Leia Organa Solo/Legends|Leia Organa Solo]] and [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]].\n\nThe main Yuuzhan Vong fleet arrived soon after though, and had in short order conquered many of the worlds in their invasion corridor. [[Bimmiel/Legends|Bimmiel]], [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], [[Dubrillion/Legends|Dubrillion]] and [[Obroa-skai/Legends|Obroa-skai]] were among the many worlds captured while [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]] was consumed by firestorms and rendered uninhabitable. Sheltering the refugees from planets in the invasion corridor quickly became such a problem that the New Republic government could no longer ignore the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong. The political leadership was ineffectual in countering the invaders though, and initially tried to blame the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] for starting the conflict with the aliens. The Yuuzhan Vong, considering the Jedi their worst enemies, capitalized on this by luring natives of the galaxy into turning in Jedi with the promise that they would be spared from the invasion. The [[Peace Brigade]] appeared as an organization of such individuals.\n[[File:TsavongLah-NEGTC.png|left|thumb|Warmaster Tsavong Lah]]\nThe Yuuzhan Vong also struck a deal with the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] that allowed them to pass through [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]] unmolested. But the Hutts secretly played both sides by passing information on Yuuzhan Vong fleet movements on to the New Republic. In return the Yuuzhan Vong ruthlessly conquered their worlds. In any case, moving through Hutt Space allowed the invaders to launch an attack against [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor]] on the far side of the galactic core. However, they suffered heavy losses in the [[Battle of Fondor]] when Han Solo's cousin, [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]], fired [[Centerpoint Station]] against them, destroying much of the defending [[Hapan]] fleet too.\n\nFollowing the conquest of [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]] offered the New Republic a cease fire if they turned over every single Jedi in the galaxy. The Jedi became hated as never before, with several planetary governments collaborating with the Yuuzhan Vong in hunting them down, and even resulting in the New Republic temporarily issuing an arrest warrant for Jedi Masters Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker.\n\nThe Peace Brigade also launched an attack on the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the children being trained there. The Yuuzhan Vong themselves arrived shortly after though, complicating the situation for the few Jedi remaining on the moon. The Yuuzhan Vong captured the Jedi trainee [[Tahiri Veila]] and started shaping her like the rest of their biological creations. However, before the experiment was completed, she was rescued by her best friend, [[Anakin Solo]], with the help of the shamed Yuuzhan Vong, [[Vua Rapuung]], redeeming the Shamed One in the process. As a result, a heretical movement that worshiped the Jedi as saviors gained popularity among the Shamed Ones (later led by Nom Anor), despite the efforts of the ruling castes to exterminate it. A short while later, the Yuuzhan Vong broke the cease fire by launching a surprise attack on [[Yag'Dhul/Legends|Yag'Dhul]].\n[[File:HidingFromTheVong.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A single New Republic soldier tries to hide from the Yuuzhan Vong, while the New Republic crumbles under their relentless invasion]]\nTwo years into the war, the Yuuzhan Vong unleashed a new biological creation, the [[voxyn]], for the purpose of hunting down the Jedi. In response, Anakin Solo formed an all-Jedi strike with the intent of hunting down the Voxyn Queen from which the Yuuzhan Vong cloned all the other voxyn. [[Mission to Myrkr|The mission]] was a success, but came at the cost of the lives of nearly half the team, including Anakin Solo himself, and also left his brother, [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], captured by the Yuuzhan Vong. Meanwhile the Yuuzhan Vong launched an immense [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|attack on Coruscant]], conquering the capital of the New Republic and killing [[Chief of State (New Republic)/Legends|Chief of State]] [[Borsk Fey'lya]]. Following that, they renamed the planet Yuuzhan'tar, and started [[Terraforming/Legends|Vongforming]] the planet in the image of their long lost homeworld. The Vongforming of Coruscant was sabotaged by Jacen Solo before he escaped from captivity with the aid of Vergere. The Yuuzhan Vong began to also suffer from internal problems, as the stresses of maintaining an [[Yuuzhan Vong empire|Empire]] began to tax their resources.\n\nThe New Republic, having moved its capital to [[Dac/Legends|Dac]], elected [[Cal Omas]] to replace Fey'lya, who also created the [[High Council (Galactic Alliance)|High Council]], which would coordinate the Jedi's role in the war. At the same time the Jedi also found out about the [[New Republic Intelligence Service|NRI's]] secret project to create [[Alpha Red]], a biological weapon that would wipe out the Yuuzhan Vong and all of their creations. The Jedi were unable to convince Cal Omas to ignore the weapon as a viable option for countering the invaders, but the rogue Jedi Knight Vergere saved them the trouble by destroying the project herself. However, the incident strained the relationship between the Jedi and the New Republic.\n\nForced to pursue conventional warfare while the Alpha Red team started from scratch, the New Republic hatched a plan to lure the Yuuzhan Vong into a trap in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]], centered around the moon, [[Ebaq 9]]. Using Jedi Knight [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] as bait, the trap was successfully sprung on the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, destroying it. On Ebaq 9, [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]] himself was slain by Jaina Solo and Vergere sacrificed herself to eliminate the rest of the Yuuzhan Vong troops that had landed on the moon. Omas, using the political clout and fearing that the Senate would try to hijack control of the war, drafted a new constitution which stripped the Senate of executive power, turning the New Republic into the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]] (Galactic Alliance or GFFA for short).\n[[File:LukeVersusShimrra.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Luke Skywalker battles Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane to the death]]\nAfter the victory, Luke Skywalker put together a team to follow up on Vergere's information about the living planet of Zonama Sekot. They traveled into the Unknown Regions, receiving help from both the Imperial Remnant and the Chiss, though only after having provided a service in return. Eventually they found the living planet and entered negotiations in an attempt to convince it to help end the war.\n\nMeanwhile, Executor Nom Anor, disgraced for his role in the disaster at Ebaq 9, disguised himself as the prophet Yu'Shaa and began stirring up heresy on Yuuzhan'tar (formerly Coruscant). He heard about Zonama Sekot and succeeded in putting together a mission to the living planet consisting of himself (still in disguise), the Shaper [[Nen Yim]], the Yuuzhan Vong priest [[Harrar]] and the two Jedi Knights Tahiri Veila and [[Corran Horn/Legends|Corran Horn]]. The five made it to Zonama Sekot where Nom Anor showed his hand and killed Nem Yim and pushed Harrar over a cliff before trying to sabotage the planet's hyperdrive. The two Jedi were unsuccessful in undoing his sabotage or preventing him from escaping the planet, but Zonama Sekot appeared to know what to do as it launched itself into hyperspace and traveled to Yuuzhan'tar, taking up orbit around the same star as the former capital of the galaxy.\n\nDuring this time, the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] had prepared to make a push for Yuuzhan'tar and take the planet back, and hopefully also break the Yuuzhan Vong's ability to wage war by taking out the Supreme Overlord. In the end, Supreme Overlord Shimrra was revealed to be nothing but a puppet for the real leader of the Yuuzhan Vong, the Force-sensitive Shamed One [[Onimi]]. Shimrra was killed by Luke Skywalker and Onimi was later killed by Jacen Solo during [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar|the second battle of Coruscant]]. [[Nas Choka]], Lah's successor as Warmaster, became de facto Supreme Overlord, and ordered the remaining Yuuzhan Vong warriors to surrender.\n\n===Post-invasion===\n[[File:Zonama_Sekot.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Zonama Sekot, the new homeworld of the Yuuzhan Vong]]\nOne of the terms of the Yuuzhan Vong's surrender was also that they help rebuild Coruscant to be suitable as the capital of the Galactic Alliance. The Galactic Alliance settled on [[Denon/Legends|Denon]] while construction went on, and eventually back to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] after the rebuilding was complete.\n\nZonama Sekot also revealed itself as the seed of the long-dead original Yuuzhan Vong homeworld. After the end of the war, the remaining Yuuzhan Vong were recalled from across the galaxy to Zonama, to be contained there (except for designated Vong required to perform duties mending the harm their people had done, any who refused exile were to be put to death). Zonama Sekot, with its new Yuuzhan Vong population, disappeared back into the Unknown Regions, so that the Yuuzhan Vong could live in peace and renew their relationship with Sekot. Among other things they planned to attempt to abolish their caste system, and had already eliminated the posts of Warmaster and Supreme Overlord (though Choka seemed to remain the ''de facto'' leader of the species).<ref name=\"UF\" />\n\nThe [[Bothan/Legends|Bothans]], however, were unforgiving for the death of Fey'lya, and continued to uphold their declared state of ''[[ar'krai]]'' genocide against the Yuuzhan Vong, sending ships into the Unknown Regions to hunt for Zonama. By [[36 ABY]] their efforts had been somewhat foiled by the Galactic Alliance, which had impounded the ship detailed for the expedition.<ref name=\"DNI:TJK\">''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''</ref>\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong war was possibly the most devastating crisis the galaxy had faced. The cost in lives were staggering; the number of deaths over the known galaxy were estimated at about 300 trillion sentients.<ref name=\"UF\" />\n\n===The Fel Empire and the One Sith===\n{{Main|Fel Empire|One Sith}}\n{{Quote|I made an alliance with the reborn Empire at Bastion.

Some time after [[41 ABY]], as part of a move to improve relations between the Yuuzhan Vong and the rest of the galaxy, the Galactic Alliance's [[New Jedi Order]] permitted Yuuzhan Vong [[Shaper caste|Shapers]], headed by Master Shaper [[Nei Rin]],<ref name=\"SW:L:G\" /> to use a desolate portion of [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]], one of the order's most ancient strongholds, as a test site.\n\nThe intent of those who championed the project&mdash;such as [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kol Skywalker]], a leading member of the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]]&mdash;was to see if Vong terraforming methods, such as those that had once transformed [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] into the species' temporary homeworld of Yuuzhan'tar ([[27 ABY/Legends|27]]-[[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]]), could restore the barren and devastated world. Though most of the species had left for the Unknown Regions on Zonama Sekot, enough shapers remained to start a pilot program on the world. The experiment appeared to work, returning vibrant life to Ossus, and when the Jedi revealed the results to the outside galaxy, other worlds vied for the chance to restore planets the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]] had left devastated.\n\nUltimately, one hundred planets were chosen for terraforming. Yuuzhan Vong Shapers, accompanied by [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], set to work, and at first the results were wondrous to behold. Unfortunately, none had reckoned with interference by the [[One Sith]]. On the command of the cult's leader, [[Darth Krayt]], the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] secretly sabotaged the terraforming process on these worlds. Plants grew deformed, and painful bony growths, of a kind not seen since the Vong forcibly took populations as slaves, sprouted from the skin of the inhabitants, killing millions in the process.\n\nThe Jedi suspected sabotage, but did not know who was responsible. All across the galaxy, however, blame fell upon the Yuuzhan Vong. Far too much animosity still existed against the former invaders for many to believe they had truly given up their ambitions of conquest. The Jedi however, were certain that the Yuuzhan Vong were innocent, and convinced the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] to support the Yuuzhan Vong against domestic criticism.\n\n[[File:FEG-YV-lecg.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Two Yuuzhan Vong confronting an FEG-series pilot droid]]\nThis turned out to be too much for the [[Fel Empire|Empire]]. The signing of the [[Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty]] ([[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]]), had brought peace between the Imperial Remnant and the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], and the war against the Yuuzhan Vong had all but united the former rivals. However, the [[Council of Moffs/Legends|Moff Council]] still contained many hardliners who sought to restore the Empire to primacy as the dominant galactic power. Calling for retribution and invoking the [[Treaty of Anaxes]], they declared war on the Galactic Alliance. The peace that so many had fought and died for in decades past was undone in a stroke, as the Sith had planned.\n\nFearing what could ultimately happen, the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi High Council]] ordered the creation of the [[Hidden Temple (Sith\u2013Imperial War)|Hidden Temple]] at the start of hostilities, its location chosen by [[Rawk|Nat Skywalker]] so the Jedi could have a refuge.<ref name=\"SW:L25\">[[Legacy (2006) 25|''Legacy'' (2006) 25]]</ref>\n\nFrom the start, the Alliance was handicapped. Its defense of the Yuuzhan Vong had alienated numerous member worlds, whose populations still nursed bitter memories of the Vong invasion, and many of them refused to support the GA. Suddenly, the Alliance found itself facing a secessionist movement as well as general war. The Empire used this to its advantage, luring some of these disaffected worlds into the Imperial camp and weakening the GA government. Other worlds, like Hapes, declared neutrality. Thus, the war started with the Empire having all the advantages, save one: Despite this, [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Roan Fel]] himself was less than enthusiastic; he had only reluctantly declared war and thus never threw his full support behind it, even going so far to prevent his [[Imperial Knight]]s from participating.<ref name=\"SW:L8\">[[Legacy (2006) 8|''Legacy'' (2006) 8]]</ref>\n\nIt was at this time that things were not going smoothly for the Fel Empire: despite the Alliance handicap, the Jedi were more than making up for that. Also, because Roan Fel refused to let the Imperial Knights enter the war, the Empire didn't have the strength necessary to counter the Jedi. Soon, the Sith inserted themselves into the war, offering to compensate for the lack of Force users that was the great hole in Imperial warfare. Through [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Morrigan Corde|Nyna Calixte]], the ruthless and ambitious [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]], the Sith approached the Empire and allied themselves with the Imperial cause. When the Sith then declared themselves openly, the Jedi quickly realized that it was they who were responsible for sabotaging the Yuuzhan Vong terraforming projects though the Order was never able to definitively prove it. As events progressed, even members of the Imperial regime&mdash;including Emperor Fel himself&mdash;realized the truth, that they had been used as pawns in the One Sith's plan for galactic domination. Sadly by the time the true motivations of the Sith had been made clear to Emperor Fel it was far too late to halt the designs already set in motion. The Yuuzhan Vong, upon learning the truth, were at first relieved that it was not the work of their gods, were then determined to reverse the damage the sabotage had caused. Shaper Nei Rin journeyed from Ossus to try to discover the Sith's method of sabotage, hoping that this knowledge could help discredit the Sith and end the war.<ref name=\"SW:L:G\" />\n\n[[File:LegacyVong.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Yuuzhan Vong over a hundred years after the war's end]]\nAfter three years of bloody warfare, the Galactic Alliance was a spent force, while the Sith only grew in power and strength, even independently manufacturing and fielding their own [[Fury-class starfighter|starfighters]].<ref name=\"SW:L0\u00bd\">[[Star Wars: Legacy (2006) 0\u00bd|''Star Wars: Legacy'' (2006) 0\u00bd]]</ref> Imperial forces had even retaken Coruscant after more than a century. The Alliance finally surrendered, and its territory was absorbed into the Empire. It is unknown if the Empire made any efforts to exterminate the Yuuzhan Vong. The [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] called on the Jedi Order to surrender and subject itself to the will of the Empire. Some of them did, becoming the [[Imperial Knight]]s. But the rest, remaining true to the will of the Force, refused to ally themselves with the Sith and withdrew from Coruscant to their temple on Ossus. The Sith eventually followed the Jedi there. Darth Nihl, former Nagai warlord turned Sith, led a brutal attack on Ossus, aided by Imperial forces led under Moff [[Rulf Yage]]. The [[Massacre at Ossus]] scattered the Jedi across the galaxy, though the order was not yet entirely defeated. Nei Rin returned to Ossus the day after with proof that the Sith had been behind the projects sabotage, but unfortunately too late to stop either the war or the massacre.<ref name=\"SW:L:G\" />\n\nShortly after, the Sith, determined to rule the galaxy themselves, turned against Emperor [[Roan Fel]] and his Imperial Knights. After killing what he later determined to have been a [[Roan Fel's double|double of the Emperor]], Darth Krayt assumed the Imperial throne himself, restoring, for the first time in over a century the rulership of a Sith as Emperor, and becoming the first Sith Lord since Darth Caedus to rule over most of the galaxy.<ref name=\"SW:L1\" /><ref name=\"Legacy of the Force: Revelation\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nThough most of the Yuuzhan Vong who accompanied the Jedi in the Ossus Project were slain, three managed to survive where they remained beneath the Jedi Temple and guarded the remains of the dead Jedi out of respect for the Jedi Order. Master Shaper [[Nei Rin]] had been off planet investigating why the project had gone wrong, but arrived back at Ossus with her findings too late to stop the War or the massacre. Shortly afterwards, Rin, her guards, and a few Jedi who had returned to the world were hiding from an Imperial patrol under the temple when the patrol's Sith commander ordered the Academy destroyed from orbit.<ref name=\"SW:L12\">[[Legacy (2006) 12|''Legacy'' (2006) 12]]</ref> Luckily, thanks to [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[K'Kruhk]], the occupants managed to survive.<ref name=\"SW:L25\" />\n\nAfter some time, it was revealed that a fanatical Yuuzhan Vong named [[Zenoc Quah]] had survived the war and had hid on [[Wayland/Legends|Wayland]] for over a century before allying with the One Sith to sabotage the Ossus Project. Seven years later, he was a part of [[Darth Maladi]]'s plot to overthrow [[Darth Wyyrlok (III)|Darth Wyyrlok]] from the rule of the Empire as well as put a new, more powerful [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] at the helm. Quah and Maladi worked at creating a new weapon that would secure their hold on the galaxy from dissident Sith. For this purpose, Maladi and Quah set up a [[Wayland trap|trap]] to capture [[Cade Skywalker]] as their test subject.\n\n==Technology==\n{{Quote|They've got technology, sweetheart. They just build it in different ways.|Han Solo to Leia Organa Solo|<ref name=\"BP\" />}}\nDue to their beliefs, the Yuuzhan Vong were opposed to technology, ranging from simple machines to droids, which they believed were a polluting influence. As such, all examples of their technology consisted of living [[biot]]s: creatures that were born and bred for their tasks.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> They preferred the use of such creatures over lifeless machines which lacked any form of spirit.<ref name=\"AoCI:HT\" /> All Yuuzhan Vong technology, whether it be starships, weapons, or simple everyday objects, was entirely biological. They hated droids, machines, electronics, and anything manufactured.<ref name=\"BP\" /> This biotechnology was coaxed into growth by the Shapers and seemed to be more resilient when compared to conventional technology.<ref name=\"NEGtWaT\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology]]''</ref>\n\nNotable pieces of technology included their feared [[yammosk]]s, which were called war coordinators due to the fact that they served as a biotic [[Battle Analysis Computer]] and had the capacity to coordinate Yuuzhan Vong forces to a frightening degree.<ref name=\"AoCI:HT\" /> Through their [[villip]]s, they had managed to create a communication system that rivaled the galactic HoloNet. Different breeds of such organisms were also capable of producing living light holograms which the Yuuzhan Vong had mastered for centuries.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> It was known that their collision avoidance systems were as good as those of the inhabitants of the galaxy. Furthermore, their equivalent of an antenna consisted of spiral fibers embedded in a yorik coral hull to regions which were sensitive to receiving communications. In addition, they made use of nutrient feeds for various biots which served in a similar capacity as power lines did for their technological equivalents.<ref name=\"FHIII:R\" /> Similar to [[Navigation computer/Legends|navigation computers]], the Yuuzhan Vong vessels possessed [[navibrain]]s that were required to plot hyperspace jumps.<ref name=\"DJ\" /> Their vessels were also required to rearm themselves after combat with the process noted as being marginally better than those of the technological inhabitants of the galaxy.<ref name=\"SbS\" />\n\nYuuzhan Vong personal weaponry included living serpentine weapons called amphistaffs that were able to alter their form allowing their user to use them as a spear or a whip. Furthermore, they wore [[Vonduun Skerr Kyrric]] armor which was capable of protecting them from weapon fire as well as lightsaber strikes. Their larger coral shaped craft made use of [[Yaret-Kor]] plasma weapons that ate through the hull of enemy ships while shielding was provided by the gravity manipulating [[dovin basal]]s that generated singularities that were used to protect the craft from enemy weapon fire and were also capable of stripping the shields of enemy vessels.<ref name=\"VP\" /> These organisms were grown independently and later grafted onto other organisms in an imperfect symbiosis<ref name=\"EotV\" /> In addition, they generated powerful gravitic fields that could also create interdiction fields that left living occupants unconscious after being pulled from hyperspace.<ref name=\"EoVII:R\" /> Larger, more insidious weapons included biological plagues capable of destroying entire worlds.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> Some plagues were unleashed that left planetary systems barren and incapable of growing food.<ref name=\"F\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''</ref>\n\nThe primary construction method through which the Yuuzhan Vong created their living vessel was through the use of [[yorik coral]]. This coral-type substance formed the hull and internal anatomy of their vessels. While several other races had mastered bioengineering, the Yuuzhan Vong were one of the few that had developed a mass production means of creating such organisms. They were capable of growing coralskippers in less than a month's time, which matched the production rate of the [[Incom Corporation/Legends|Incom Corporation]] [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] but had the benefit of not producing any waste material from normal industrial techniques.<ref name=\"DTI:O\" /> The outer ''skin'' of such craft, despite being alive, did not feel anything in the vacuum of space as the nerves were not exposed to the cold of the void. They were created to lack any nerve endings at such locations.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> Though the outer hull did not possess any nerve endings, the inner hull did and any breach led to alarms being raised, thus alerting the Yuuzhan Vong of intruders. Something not commonly known was that the nerves near the dovin basals were compromised due to the creatures' gravitic nature. As the dovin basals were independently grown, they were nursed separately and later grafted onto their host vessels. However, the symbiosis was not perfect and the gravitic distortion created by the dovin basals desensitized the nerve clusters that were adjacent to it. Amongst warships or any other vessels, the Yuuzhan Vong compensated this problem by implanting special nerve biots around the dovin basal in order to create a complete tactile net that would not be confused by the gravitic anomaly. However, certain low priority ships were not afforded this amenity and thus created blind spots for a breaching action.<ref name=\"EotV\" /> Inside these ships, much of the systems had technological equivalents such as a central biotic computer like the targeting brain. However, it was sensor systems that were the most different as instead of any externally mounted observatory sensors, the Yuuzhan Vong employed a means of sensing the gravitational distortions of distant objects as a means of scanning.<ref name=\"SbS\" />\n\nA key interface element within Yuuzhan Vong biots that linked them to their organic ships and technology were cognition hoods. These organic helmets simply slid on top of an individuals head and were connected by an organic cord linked to the ship itself. Through this contact, a pilot was capable of making a direct interface with the ship and communicating with it. This was the case either with organic pilots and droids which were capable of processing the data being sent to the hood.<ref name=\"VP\" /> Onboard larger carrier ships, a central cognition hood was used by the ships commander to deliver commands to the vessel. However, should this hood be severed, then secondary cognition hoods located on smaller craft such as coralskippers were capable of sending commands from the fighter to the carrier vessel thus allowing some level of control.<ref name=\"EotV\" /> By wearing the hood, a pilot was capable of experiencing the memories of the ship they were linked to thus allowing them to be a part of the ship in question.<ref name=\"DTI:O\" /> Yuuzhan Vong ships communicated in the Yuuzhan Vong language which left a language barrier between foreign pilots and the vessel. However, it was possible to impart images and thoughts through the hood to the ship, thus allowing it to be controlled.<ref name=\"EotV\" /> A much more larger and powerful version of these biots was the [[cognition throne]].\n\nSome of their more famous technologies were the [[amphistaff]], the [[yorik-et]], the [[dovin basal]], the [[gnullith]], the [[grashal]], the [[Cloaker|ooglith cloaker]], the ooglith masquer, the [[villip]], and the [[yammosk]].\n\n===Long-Range Weaponry===\n*[[Blast bug]] (thrown)\n*[[Magma pebble]] (thrown)\n*[[Nang hul]] (thrown)\n*[[Plaeryin bol]]\n*[[Plasma eel|Plasma Eel]] (thrown)\n*[[Razor bug]] (thrown)\n*[[Snap bug]] (thrown)\n*[[Yaret-Kor]]\n\n===Melee Weaponry===\n*[[Amphistaff]] (mid-range)\n*Claws (short range)\n*[[Coufee]] (short range, common [[Chazrach]] weapon)\n*[[Tsaisi]] (mid-range)\n\n==Yuuzhan Vong in the galaxy==\n[[File:YuuzhanVongwarriors.jpg|thumb|220px|Yuuzhan Vong Warriors]]\n*[[Nom Anor]], a member of the Intendant Caste whose duties included espionage.

In his critique of the concept, Lucas forbade the story team from going in this direction, requesting that they ''\"be more original\"'' and not make the villains dark side users. This feedback soon led to the creation of the Yuuzhan Vong as unique antagonists for the series.<ref name=\"The Essential Reader's Companion\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{YouTube|video=R19qQCyhodo|text=Crafting An Epic: The Making of the New Jedi Order &#124; Part I: Creation &#124; Star Wars Documentary|channel=@holonetwork|name=holonet|date=2025-01-08|archivedate=20250109063704}}</ref>\n\n===Origins of \"Yuuzhan Vong\"===\nThe name \"Yuuzhan Vong\" was developed at a French-Thai restaurant in New York City, called Vong, which several [[Del Rey]] employees were patroning.

A. Salvatore]], and their love of pain was originally confined to [[Domain Shai]], but this was expanded to the species as a whole, in part due to their religious beliefs and relationship to Yun-Yuuzhan, as established in the story bible.<ref name=\"SW:NJORRI\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Yuuzhan Vong and the Force===\nAs discovered by the Jedi during the war with the Yuuzhan Vong they are apparently \"absent\" from the Force. In the book ''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]'' by [[James Luceno]], the reason for this is given. The Yuuzhan Vong are not \"absent\" from the Force; their entire species has been cut off from it. It is surmised in the novel that this was implemented by the intelligence of their homeworld, the seed of which would one day become [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]], because of their war-mongering and hostile conquering of other species.\n\n===Real world inspirations===\nYuuzhan Vong culture and religion were heavily influenced by Mesoamerican cultures.<ref name=\"SW:NJORRI\" /> James Luceno had recently returned from a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization Mayan] expedition to Guatemala immediately prior to the Skywalker Ranch meeting in 1998, and he had long had an interest in Mesoamerican societies. Picking up on this, Del Rey editor [[Steve Saffel]] suggested taking inspiration specifically from the eventual fates of Mayan and [[Wikipedia:Aztecs|Aztec]] indigenous cultures (''\"cultures of inherent tragedy\"''<ref name=\"Bookshelf\" />) to this effect,  and he prompted Luceno with the notion, leading to Luceno filling in the rest of the story team on Mayan and Aztec cosmology and history. Luceno suggested characterizing the Yuuzhan Vong as ''\"tragic wanderers rather than hateful invaders\"''<ref name=\"Bookshelf\">{{InsiderCite|44|Bookshelf|''Star Wars'' Bookshelf}}</ref>, with the notion of an invading people being a wandering tribe in search of their ''\"promised land,\"'' being directly inspired by the Aztec search for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztl%C3%A1n Aztl\u00e1n]. The story team was receptive to the concept, with Michael Stackpole remarking, ''\"I specifically remember Jim Luceno saying, using the Aztecs, or the cosmology as a model, that that would work out pretty cool... And man, I concurred.\"''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFurther inspirations from, and parallels to, Mesoamerican cultures would be drawn as Luceno set to work on writing the story bible, with him specifically basing the mythology of the god Yun-Yuuzhan on that of the Aztec god [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlaltecuhtli Tlaltecuhtli]. The idea of the Yuuzhan Vong sacrificing elements of themselves or others as offerings for the gods was directly taken from Aztec and Mayan practices and beliefs, stemming from the belief in a creator god who sacrificed themselves to create the universe. Mesoamerican ritual tattooing and body modifications to this effect also served as direct inspirations for the Vong. Additionally, Luceno would draw inspiration from the Mayan mythology of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Hero_Twins Hero Twins], Hunahpu and Xbalanque, for the roles of Anakin, Jacen, and Jaina Solo and the Yuuzhan Vong's mythological relationship to them.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe notion of the invading force first sending forth those using deception and disguise, arriving in the guise of merchants, traders, or other professions, to infiltrate, spy, and stir up trouble, as characters like Yomin Carr and Nom Anor do throughout the series, was directly inspired by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pochteca pochteca] of Aztec society, who performed that function for the expansion of the Aztec Empire into surrounding lands. In addition, aspects of the Yuuzhan Vong culture, such as the Shamed Ones and the caste system in general, were inspired by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit Dalit] people of India, commonly known as the \"untouchables,\" as well as the caste system of Mayan society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe development of the shaper caste was informed by author [[Greg Keyes]]' own anthropological background, in which he had previously explored the oral traditions and beliefs of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctaw Choctaw] people. For the shapers in particular, Keyes drew upon his experiences in Malaysia where he was exposed to elements of the indigenous culture there; in developing the shapers, Keyes looked to the ancient [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_peoples Austronesians] for inspiration, as well as to their descendants, including the various [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesians Melanesian] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesians Polynesian] peoples. Some of the naming conventions of the shapers in his novels were drawn from names and mythologies of Pacific origin, such as for [[Mezhan Kwaad]].

    "plain_text": "leg\nlanguage]]\ncitation\nneeds a significant expansion; history, biology, culture. Everything.\nYuuzhan Vong]]\nThe New Jedi Order: Destinys Way\nThe Yuuzhan Vong&mdash;\"Children of Yun-Yuuzhan\", also called the Chosen Race, known to the Chiss and Ferroans as the Far Outsiders, and sometimes incorrectly abbreviated to Vong (which implied that one was disowned by their family and their gods)&mdash;were a nomadic extra-galactic sentient species that nearly destroyed the New Republic, and were responsible for the deaths of over 300 trillion sentient beings during their invasion of the galaxy.\nThe Yuuzhan Vong were descended from an ancestral species from the planet Yuuzhan'tar in a distant galaxy. A typical Yuuzhan Vong resembled a Human in form, though they were taller and heavier than the average Human and had less hair on their heads. The Yuuzhan Vong were religious zealots, who viewed mechanical technology as blasphemy. Their technological innovations were genetically engineered and purely organic. Additionally, the Yuuzhan Vong deeply respected pain to the point of sadomasochism and strove to improve their physical capabilities through organ grafting. Such grafting was a status symbol within Yuuzhan Vong society.\nPerhaps most notably, the Yuuzhan Vong were unable to be sensed through the Force. This confounded the Jedi who first encountered the Yuuzhan Vong. However, they were susceptible to some Force based attacks.\n\n\u2022 Biology and appearance\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong were a humanoid species&mdash;initially leading some to believe that they were a Human offshoot race&mdash;but there were differences between Humans and Yuuzhan Vong. For example, Yuuzhan Vong typically lacked kidneys.The New Jedi Order: Ylesia The Yuuzhan Vong were also much taller and had heavier builds than the average Human, though this could be a result of selective breeding. Yuuzhan Vong also had an average lifespan of 76 standard years, but their maximum lifespan was two to three times that of an average Humans.The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force' Genetically, they shared many elements that made them similar to Humans, which was considered unusual as they were an extragalactic species, but one notable difference was one element of their genetic structure that was present in all their biotechnology.\nYuuzhan Vong had sloping, almost ridge-like foreheads. Several Yuuzhan Vong had been seen with pointed ears, while just as many had been seen without them. These could have been ritual mutilations, or a genetic variation; there is no conclusive evidence as to what the species norm was. Yuuzhan Vong also had short, stub-like noses, making their faces appear skull-like. The Yuuzhan Vong usually had black hair, though in lesser amounts on both the head and body than Humans, but often wore it much longer than them (in many cases, they were also completely bald). Small blue sacks could be found under the eyes of the Yuuzhan Vong, and they were often considered a mark of beauty. These eyesacks expanded and contracted to reflect a Yuuzhan Vongs mood, as the species did not use the facial expressions preferred by Humans.The New Jedi Order: Star by Star Through the blue sacks under their eyes, they were capable of telling if an individual was in delight or were suffering from rage.The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion The most common skin tone among the Yuuzhan Vong was gray, with the second most common being yellow. Another major characteristic was their jet black blood.\nThe Yuuzhan Vong nervous system was very conductive, as if it was made specifically for feeling pain.The New Jedi Order: Balance Point This nervous system was noted as containing aspects that were not found in Humans and likewise, there were elements within a Human nervous system that were not found in a Yuuzhan Vong. It was also noted that their tissue was very different from a Humans, which made the use of the Yuuzhan Vong Qah cells difficult on them as the Human brain eventually rejected the cells.The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy'\nPerhaps the most notable and most disturbing (to Jedi and other dwellers of the galaxy) trait of the Yuuzhan Vong was that they were outside of the Force as the Jedi knew it. They had no Force presence that could be sensed, and were unaffected by most Force powers that were targeted directly at them. This meant that any attempt to sense their motivation, truthfulness or determine their next course of action were futile, although it did mean that one was capable of detecting them by reaching out in the Force and determining if the person had no presence within it.The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest Even a normally powerful telekinetic blast that was capable of launching an ordinary opponent off their feet at high speeds simply caused a Yuuzhan Vong either to stumble, or lose balance temporarily.The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth While it was mostly impossible to affect the Yuuzhan Vong directly through the use of the Force, it was possible to use indirect means to accomplish such a task, such as manipulating an object through telekinesis and throwing it at a Yuuzhan Vong, which would injure them, or by controlling the air in an attempt to increase the pressure, thus allowing a Jedi to, in effect, crush the Yuuzhan Vong. The only known Force techniques that seemed somehow exempt from this limitation were variations on Force lightning/Emerald lightning, the dark side technique Force net, Dark Transfer, and to an extent Shatterpoint.The New Jedi Order: The Unifying ForceLegacy (2006) 15Legacy (2006) 19\nA small number of Jedi developed another ability, the Vongsense. In some ways, this ability worked similarly to the Force, especially the detection and telepathic aspects of the Force, but only relating to the Yuuzhan Vong and their biots.The New Jedi Order: Traitor\n\n\u2022 Culture\n\nYuuzhan Vong culture was centered around sacrifice and their gods, although warriors in particular were centered on the philosophy of pain. They tended to glorify pain; not as a motive for action, but rather as a state of living. This was because they believed that, just like their gods had sacrificed their bodies to create the galaxy, the Yuuzhan Vong themselves were to sacrifice parts of their body for a greater purpose. As such, they believed that, by remaking their own bodies, they were becoming closer to their deities. While this was the case, they never maimed their bodies in a manner that would permanently hinder their ability to function. This resulted in individual Yuuzhan Vong having mottling or scarring, and sweeping tattoos. The more elite individuals were even known to graft organs from other creatures into their bodies. Devotional practices to the gods called for bloodletting at prayer times. Shamed Ones were forbidden from attending religious ceremonies.\nAs a Yuuzhan Vong grew more successful in their life, they began the process of sacrificing body parts and replacing them with organs from another creature, thus enhancing their abilities. This was done so during the Escalatier Ceremony, where an engineered organism related to an Implanter began to make cuts and incisions, and place the implants. At times, the implant was accepted into the body and the Yuuzhan Vong was promoted to a higher rank.The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse However, there were occasions where the implant failed to be accepted into the body. This resulted either in death or the individual becoming a derided Shamed One. Such failures were believed to have been the work of the Yuuzhan Vong gods, though there were times that such a happenstance was due to the failure of the Shaper in charge of the Escalation ceremony.\nFamily was noted as being a strong element within their society.The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee A member of the Yuuzhan Vong was typically associated with a family group, known typically as a Domain. Some Domains were more powerful than others. In addition to this family structure, the Yuuzhan Vong also employed a caste based system which included respective castes for warriors, shapers, priests, intendants and workers. Love affairs between two different castes was considered forbidden. In fact, domain loyalties ran deep, and went far beyond simple likes or dislikes. There were a series of ritual statements that a Yuuzhan Vong was required to utter as part of protocol from a member of lower ranks to a member of a higher rank.The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream While this was the case, members of one caste were not obligated to salute a superior from another caste, which was the case with intendants to higher ranking members of the warrior caste.\nYuuzhan Vong children were raised in caste-specific cr\u00e8ches by designated caretakers, and likely did not know their biological parents until they were older. Their cr\u00e8che parents named them. Deformed children were killed at birth, but, if the deformity was mild enough, as was the case with one Ona Shai, the child was spared. A useful survival trait for these children in order to live through such a harsh and competitive environment was paranoia. Twin births were uncommon events; only a handful of cases were known to the New Republic, in which each was thought to be a portent of a great event. In each case, one twin killed the other as a prelude to a great destiny.The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey Funeral processions were typically carried out in a way that did not preserve the dead, and Yuuzhan Vong mortuaries often consisted of Yuuzhan Vong mourners who met with assigned priests. During such conditions, priests were involved in removing various body parts of the dead in order to dedicate them to the various gods.\nAccording to the insights of an Imperial officer, the Empire and the Yuuzhan Vong had some elements that were common to one another. These included the need for strict discipline and the obedience to ones superior officer. However, at the time of the invasion, it was believed that their ultimate goals were completely different, with the Yuuzhan Vong desiring to change the way of life of the inhabitants of the galaxy. One of their goals was the destruction and removal of all forms of manufactured technology, which was one of the key strengths of the Imperial Remnant. This great belief in discipline and obedience in ones superiors meant that subordinates never contradicted their leaders; they were capable of subverting or altering the will of their commanders, but did not point out errors in that will. They were ultimately highly skilled warriors who never retreated in the face of defeat, as they feared this would insult their gods. While this was largely the case, it was known that certain Yuuzhan Vong were capable of cowardly actions. For actions like this, they became Shamed Ones.The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant\nYuuzhan Vong beliefs highly influenced their actions and personality. According to their religion, life was suffering, and death was the ultimate release from that suffering. As such, the Yuuzhan Vong felt that nothing could be learned unless it was purchased in pain, and were resigned to and willingly went to their deaths. Some amongst their race, such as Domain Shai, went as far as to inflict pain on themselves to the point that they enjoyed it. Such groups felt that the infliction of pain was a means of earning the favor of their deities. Furthermore, it was believed that the greatest glory was death in battle. This fixation on death varied depending on the circumstances, as dying in the cold void between galaxies was considered a disgraceful death. Consequently, this meant that most Yuuzhan Vong fought to the death and thus also meant that other empires had very few opportunities of exploring the extragalactic aliens organic warships. In addition, the priests claimed that they did not ask of others what they themselves did not accomplish, meaning that they equally sacrificed their own numbers as well as \"infidels\". This was an act of service to their deities, who were believed to have sacrificed their body parts in order to create all of existence.The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Heros Trial\nThe species also greatly believed in honor, with that subject ranking quite high in the beliefs of certain members of the race. Even under interrogations, the word of a Yuuzhan Vong was high, and, if they promised respite to their victims for revealing information, they typically kept their word. In one case, a Yuuzhan Vong commander agreed to a personal duel over the fate of a planet and, if defeated, he agreed that his forces would spare that world. While the Yuuzhan Vong himself was sincere, his subordinates worked with the Warmaster to subvert that honorable combat.The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin Furthermore, the denial of the right to honorable combat was seen as a disrespectful act, worthy of scorn from the warrior caste. In fact, warriors would even consider a single worthy opponent of fighting a single Yuuzhan Vong warrior at a time worthy of respect in regard to their bravery as well as their fighting skills. There also existed a similar concept to the Wookiee Life debt, which was known as Us-hrok. This was a display that showed eternal gratitude and loyalty to another for something they had done, and meant that the Yuuzhan Vong in question would fight to the death on that person's behalf. In regards to food, the Yuuzhan Vong held no great joy of eating and thus felt indifferent about gastronomic tastes. The only exception of this was if the enjoyment came from an event such as the slaying of a great beast during a ritual.\nThe psychology of the Yuuzhan Vong during wartime engagements was based around attack, and involved the use of high levels of aggression. This made them dangerous, though at times their actions were somewhat predictable. The Yuuzhan Vong were often encouraged by an enemys resistance to them and tended to see such foes as being worthy of fighting. Internally, the Yuuzhan Vong greatly believed in the concept of competition as a means of breeding strength. However, this had the side effect of bringing about internal feuds between Domains and castes, who would attempt to escalate their positions above their kin. This resulted in civil war in the past, and it was believed that the Invasion would allow the Yuuzhan Vong an external enemy to fight, but after some time the same divisions began to appear once more. They also believed deeply in the concept of revenge, and had no reservations to the use of aggressive emotions&mdash;unlike the Jedi. This often meant that the Yuuzhan Vong engaged in suicide attacks or ritual suicides when facing defeat in order to attain glory, which was a source of pride of the warrior caste. This aggressive and warlike nature meant that they did not have any concept of peace or remorse. In their language, peace meant the willing submission to a conqueror. Furthermore, within their society, the use of profanities meant that the individual in question was capable of calling out a blood challenge to his opponent; the two would fight in a battle to the death. In addition, the use of particular insulting words, such as calling the other a \"fool\", meant that the wounded party was perfectly within their rights and even expected by their comrades to kill their opponent. This meant that an attack on a Yuuzhan Vongs pride was the grounds for demanding satisfaction, which was also capable of being accepted as a sacrifice to their gods.\nThe Yuuzhan Vong had a fanatical hatred of machines, believing them to be abominations and an affront to their gods. According to their beliefs at the time of the Invasion, they believed that combustion, the creation of fire through a machine, was the first abomination. This was because the Yuuzhan Vong believed deeply in life, but also felt that all life ended as in the wild; one type of lifeform was eaten by another, who in turn was devoured by another predator until it died, which replenished the ecosystem. This meant that death was prevalent constantly, but allowed new life to grow while machines did not die, meaning that they were capable of replacing organic life&mdash;which was something the Yuuzhan Vong would never allow.\nThe species possessed a saying: \"Let the enemy fight\", which was one of the aspects of their racial psychology. They often expected combat and arranged ambushes for their enemies, after which they baited targets into their traps. Their interdiction forces often remained outside their designated routes in order to jump onto a target, thus trapping them as a type of ambush. Another saying included \"A fleet that fights two battles loses twice.\" Ultimately, the Yuuzhan Vongs earlier relations with other races was based on domination of the lesser species, as they felt most other races were unworthy. Those that managed to impress the Yuuzhan Vong and were considered worthy were often provided a clean death while the others were relegated to slavery.Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook'\nDespite elements of their society which were seen as being barbaric, the Yuuzhan Vong truly revered life and all its forms. Among the few infidel races of the Promised Land, they tended to favor the HoDin, whose natural senses meant that they did not like the presence of advanced technology. Some primitive races who did not make use of technology were also known to have willingly allied with the Yuuzhan Vong, such as some of the inhabitants of Wayland. These \"Wish-To-Bes\" believed that the Yuuzhan Vong were like them in that they respected life, while the majority believed that this was not true, as the \"Cut-Up-People\" simply wished to harm as well as twist things to suit their needs.\"Emissary of the Void\" According to their religion, they had to prove themselves worthy creations of their deities, and if they did not do so then they would be destroyed&mdash;after which they would be replaced by a more worthy species. Their beliefs stated that this had happened three times in their religion, with a new species created, eventually leading to the gods creating the Yuuzhan Vong.\nIn the post-War period, the Yuuzhan Vong became a deeply spiritual as well as introspective people. Many felt that they would never be able to mend relations with the inhabitants of the galaxy due to the Yuuzhan Vong War, though a few heroic members of this race believed that they needed to evolve in order to survive. Thus, they felt that the journey to better relations was one that was worth the effort. They still retained their different form of honor in this age, with both custom and ritual still being an important aspect of their culture.Star Wars: Legacy: Ghosts\n\n\u2022 Society description\n\n\u2022 Supreme Overlord\n\nSupreme Overlord\nThe highest caste was Supreme Overlord, who had control over all other castes.The Essential Guide to Warfare\n\n\u2022 Priest caste\n\nPriest caste\nThe priest caste was considerably powerful in the Yuuzhan Vong's rigidly theocratic society. The members of the priest caste served the many lesser deities that ruled the Yuuzhan Vong. There were several sects, each for the worship of a different Yuuzhan Vong deity. Ranks of the priest caste included the Mosthigh priest, High Priest(ess), Priest(ess), and Seer.\n\n\u2022 Warrior caste\n\nWarrior caste\nThe warrior caste served as the armies of the Yuuzhan Vong and was one of the largest castes who essentially served as the military branch of their race. Members of the caste were trained from an early age to excel in combat. Warriors were also more aggressive than other Yuuzhan Vong. Notable members of this caste included Tsavong Lah and Nas Choka, both of whom became Warmaster of the Yuuzhan Vong at various points. Their chief weapon was the amphistaff, which resembled a deadly serpent capable of spitting venom or coiling around foes. The warriors were devotees of the Slayer, Yun-Yammka, and sought honor in combat. They wore the living vonduun crab armor which was capable of resisting blaster fire or lightsabers. This armor did have weak points, such as points at the armpit and areas of the inner hip where the shell's segments joined.\nRanks of the warrior caste included the Warmaster, Supreme Commander, Commander, Subaltern, and Warrior.\n\n\u2022 Intendant caste\n\nIntendant caste\nThe Intendant caste worked to keep Yuuzhan Vong society functioning and was as such responsible for the Yuuzhan Vong economy. They were noted as being the smallest of the castes who lacked a patron deity or a specific war cry when compared to the others. It was this caste that were in charge of matters of commerce, bureaucracy, trade and the management of the sizable slave work force employed by the Yuuzhan Vong. Notable Intendants included Nom Anor, the deadliest enemy of the Jedi. Members of the Intendant Caste could come from either the Shaper or Warrior castes. Shimrra Jamaane was formerly an Intendant, before becoming Supreme Overlord. They were the government and politicians and favored Yun-Harla the Trickster godess.\nRanks of the Intendant caste included High Prefect, Prefect, Consul, Executor, and Attendant.\n\n\u2022 Worker caste\n\nWorker caste\nThe worker caste was the largest, yet lowest, caste and served mainly as servants, slaves and laborers. The worker caste included Shamed Ones, Yuuzhan Vong whose bodies had rejected any organic implants and modifications, Yuuzhan Vong born outright into the worker caste, Yuuzhan Vong who had failed to succeed in other castes, and conquered or shaped species such as the Chazrach. Slaves and the Shamed Ones (fallen members of society) were part of the worker castes, but they were treated with contempt even by their fellow workers, though Yuuzhan Vong born into the worker caste were actually descended from Shamed Ones.\n\n\u2022 Deities\n\nTsavong Lah\nThe Yuuzhan Vong religion, called the True Way, was very important to the Yuuzhan Vong. They were devout and had many gods and, prior to their defeat, believed it was their duty to appease their gods' desires through conquest and genocide.\n\n\u2022 Yun-Yuuzhan\n\nYun-Yuuzhan\nYun-Yuuzhan, the creator, was the most powerful deity of the Yuuzhan Vong religion. He sacrificed most of his body parts to create the lesser deities and the Yuuzhan Vong galaxy. Only the Supreme Overlord had direct contact with him.\n\n\u2022 Yun-Harla\n\nYun-Harla\nYun-Harla was the Trickster, the Cloaked Goddess and goddess of deception and aggression. Yun-Harla represented the political caste. Having learned this information, the New Republic military had their top pilot, Jaina Solo, codenamed \"Trickster\" and \"Goddess\" in an act of psychological warfare against the Yuuzhan Vong invaders, who would believe they were fighting the living form of one of their most powerful deities.\n\n\u2022 Yun-Yammka\n\nYun-Yammka\nYun-Yammka was the Slayer, and the god of war. His image was of a multi-tentacled being, and was the inspiration for the form of the yammosk. He was primarily worshipped by the warrior caste. He was in actuality created by the priest caste when the Yuuzhan Vong turned to war.\n\n\u2022 Yun-Ne'Shel\n\nYun-Ne'Shel\nYun-Ne'Shel was the Modeler. She oversaw natural life cycles and was worshiped by the shaper caste.\n\n\u2022 Yun-Txiin and Yun-Q'aah (The Lover Gods)\n\nYun-Q'aah\nYun-Txiin and Yun-Qaah were the Lover Gods and twins. Having a relationship outside ones caste was forbidden in Yuuzhan Vong society, and disobeying automatically led to sacrifice to the Lover Gods.\n\n\u2022 Yun-Shuno\n\nYun-Shuno\nYun-Shuno was the Pardoner. She had a thousand eyes and watched over and spoke for the Shamed Ones, who were shunned by every other Yuuzhan Vong deity. She was the only deity the Shamed Ones were allowed to worship.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Early history\n\nUr-Yuuzhan Vong\nHarrar\nThe Yuuzhan Vong were refugees from a distant galaxy. Their original homeworld, Yuuzhan'tar was a tropical planet that had a large asteroid belt around it. It was destroyed thousands of standard years before they invaded the galaxy.\nIn Yuuzhan Vong, Yuuzhantar meant \"Cr\u00e8che of the gods\", and the living planet was a template for the Yuuzhan Vong deities. Yuuzhantar may have been the basis for Yun-Yuuzhan, the creator god of the Yuuzhan Vong.\nLittle was known about their early history, but the Yuuzhan Vong had apparently once lived as symbiotes with their homeworld and were Force-sensitive. Their technology was also largely organic. At some point in their history, the Yuuzhan Vong were caught in the midst of a devastating galactic conflict between two droid civilizations&mdash;believed to be the Silentium and the Abominor&mdash;which solidified their hatred of mechanical technology and xenophobia towards other sentient lifeforms.The New Essential Guide to Droids\nThe Yuuzhan Vong's living homeworld aided them in the war by bestowing upon them the knowledge of creating living weapons. However, as the war dragged on, the Yuuzhan Vong as a species became increasingly violent and warlike. Eventually, they were able to defeat their enemies, and forced both droid powers to flee their galaxy.\nFollowing the war, the Yuuzhan Vong went on a crusade to cleanse their galaxy of all forms of mechanical technology. They conquered much of their galaxy and either exterminated or enslaved conquered species. Among those species they conquered were the reptilian Chazrach, which became slave soldiers for the Yuuzhan Vong.\nWith much of the galaxy in their hands, the various Domains (what the Yuuzhan Vong called clans or families) fractured and turned against each other, resulting in the devastating Cremlevian War. During the conflict, much of the Yuuzhan Vongs galaxy was destroyed, including their homeworld, Yuuzhantar. The exact details of the destruction of the planet were lost to the passage of time. However, Yuuzhan'tar did produce a seed which eventually became Zonama Sekot, later colonized by the Langhesi and Ferroans.\nSeparated from their original symbiosis with their homeworld, the Yuuzhan Vong were stripped from the Force, and experienced great pain. Thus, the species saw pain as the only way to return to that symbiosis and practiced body modifications on themselves. In place of their homeworld, the Yuuzhan Vong took up belief in several deities, which subsequently governed nearly every aspect of their civilization.\nTowards the end of the war, Steng emerged as the first Warmaster. A rival Warmaster, Yogand, invented the Yogands Core tactic, which he used to destroy the planet Ygziir and its moon. The destruction of Ygziir resulted in the death of Steng and the end of the war. Eventually, Yogand united the Domains into a single socio-political entity and became the first Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Vong.\nWith much of their galaxy ruined, the Yuuzhan Vong began a long trek to another galaxy in search of a new home. For a long period, perhaps centuries, the species was forced to travel through the Intergalactic Void in massive worldships. During this period, the Yuuzhan Vong nearly destroyed themselves. Violence and competition had been inevitably built into their society and, without an external target, they focused their aggression against each other. Though there were no all out wars in the magnitude of the Cremlevian War, the Domains continued to fight each other for the favor of the Supreme Overlords.\n\n\u2022 Pre-invasion\n\nOutbound Flight']]\nWhen the Yuuzhan Vong left their galaxy, how long their voyage took, or if they even knew what their destination would be, was unknown. At least one account spoke of their journey taking at least several millennia; however, by 26 ABY, one of the oldest worldships (old enough to be dying, and considered to be ancient) was less than 1000 years old. It would appear that by 3997 BBY, sometime after Exar Kun became the new Dark Lord of the Sith, the Praetorite Vongs slivilith probe creatures had arrived,The New Essential Chronology and as of 3963 BBY, at least one scout had reached the Wild Space region of the known galaxy. In that year, a group of Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders under the command of Canderous Ordo encountered what would later come to be known as a Yorik-stronha, disguised as an asteroid in the Crispin system, while chasing a group of pirates in the systems asteroid belt. When Ordo used a thermal generator to melt the frozen methane covering the \"asteroid\", the Yorik-Stronha, in Ordos words, \"woke up\". The asteroid began to spin quickly and then proceeded to fire plasma at the Mandalorians. The extragalactic weaponry was able to melt through the Mandalorians armor \"like wax\". The attack on the Mandalorians became the \"first contact\" with the Known Galaxy. The probe fled soon after the brief battle with Ordos Mandalorians. Ordo followed in hot pursuit, but was unable to keep up with the probe. The Mandalorians were able to track the probes hyperspace wake to the edge of the galaxy, where the Neo-Crusaders turned back, apparently thinking that the mysterious ship was going on a suicide run into the great void outside the galaxy.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Also in this general time frame, a female Shaper arrived in the galaxy in suspended animation, crashing on Lorrd and surviving there for several decades, interacting with locals who believed her to be a demon.\nBetween 229 and 89 BBY, the living planet Zonama Sekot&mdash;a seed of Yuuzhantar&mdash;arrived in the Gardaji Rift.Rogue Planet In 33 BBY, a Yuuzhan Vong was captured and ended up in Cog Hive Seven, a prison colony wherein deadly gladiatorial matches regularly took place between inmates. The Yuuzhan Vong, who had already killed two fellow inmates in transit to the colony, quickly emerged as the stations most recent champion. For six months, the warrior systematically defeated every opponent pitted against the Yuuzhan Vong, until the champion was matched with Sith Lord Darth Maul, who was on an undercover mission on Cog Hive Seven. After a brutal fight, (where the Sith was under orders to not use the Force and, of course, could not passively sense anything of his foes planned moves) Maul killed the warrior. As the Yuuzhan Vong had only spoken in the species native language, the colonys systems had failed to classify its species, point of origin, or even gender, although some of the guards suspected that the individual was a female.Maul: Lockdown'\nIn 32 BBY, at the time of the Invasion of Naboo, an advance force of Yuuzhan Vong&mdash;termed \"Far Outsiders\" by the planets inhabitants&mdash;discovered Zonama, and noting the similarity to Yuuzhantar (though not drawing the connection) attempted to colonize it. However, when the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to settle, Zonama Sekots biosphere killed off the Yuuzhan Vong flora and fauna, provoking them. Although Sekot attempted to negotiate with them, they began an assault upon the planet. After two years of costly fighting, the assault was called off with the arrival of the Jedi Knight Vergere, who convinced the Yuuzhan Vong to leave on the condition that she would travel with them. The Galactic Republic received only shadowy news at the attack; even after Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker went to investigate Vergeres disappearance, all that they discovered was that an unknown race of biotech-based aliens from a distant place and armed with weapons that the planet's inhabitants had never seen before had attacked the world.\nIn 29 BBY, after learning of Zonama Sekot, Supreme Overlord Quoreal's determination to invade began to waver. The Yuuzhan Vong soon learned that Zonama Sekot was no longer in its original system, and there was no evidence that it had been destroyed. Worried about the threat presented by the powerful planetary entity, he announced to his people that it would be best to move on to another galaxy. However, Shimrra Jamaane, under the influence of Onimi and with the support of some of the more aggressive domains, launched a coup, murdered Quoreal and took his place, ensuring that the invasion would go forth as planned. But it would still be some time before they were ready.\nInformation of Yuuzhan Vong activity within the galaxy for the next few decades is scarce. It is known that, by 27 BBY, at the start of the Outbound Flight Project, Palpatine had somehow gained knowledge of the incoming Yuuzhan Vong fleet, though he planned to withhold it from the Republic until after his New Order could be instituted. At least one of his subordinates, Kinman Doriana, was informed, however. The distant threat of invasion was also part of the reason Palpatine ordered the destruction of Outbound Flight in order to prevent its occupants from falling into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong (and also to eliminate six Jedi Masters and twelve Jedi Knights). Following the end of the Clone Wars, Emperor Palpatine let out hints of the Yuuzhan Vong to the public. One of his official justifications for maintaining the Imperial Navy even after the war had ended was to ward off the threat of extra-galactic invasion.Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections\nIt was also around this time that another small reconnaissance force of Yuuzhan Vong engaged the Chiss Defense Fleet, on the edge of the Chiss Ascendancy. Although the Chiss Admiral Aralani managed to defeat them, the Yuuzhan Vong fought much better than the Chiss had believed such a small fleet was capable of. The appearance of the Outbound Flight shortly afterwards led the CEDF high command to wonder for a short time if the invaders and the Republic were allies.\nSometime between 27 BBY and 22 ABY, it was speculated by some Chiss that the Yuuzhan Vong had made a pact with the Vagaari against the Chiss.Survivor's Quest\nYuuzhan Vong scouts returned dozens of kidnapped sentients to the fleet from the galaxy. Among them were Humans, Verpine, and Talz. They were interrogated and experimented upon, with many dying and others being sacrificed. Those who survived (such as Vergere) were awarded as familiars. Around 25 BBY, three years before the Clone Wars, the Yuuzhan Vong also established a small outpost on the planet Bimmiel. After the formation of the Galactic Empire, Imperial scientists established a base on the same planet, suggesting that Palpatine might have had direct contact with the invaders. However, the remains of the Yuuzhan Vong occupying the outpost went undisturbed until their discovery shortly into the Yuuzhan Vong invasion.The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught It is also known that Yuuzhan Vong scouts were active in the galaxy during the Clone Wars.Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds\nThe Yuuzhan Vong advance scouts themselves shared that sentiment. After the formation of the Imperial Interim Council in 11 ABY, following the final death of the reborn Emperor Palpatine, Yuuzhan Vong executor Nom Anor was tasked to infiltrate the Council. He did so and manipulated its leader, Xandel Carivus, arranging the deaths of many Councilors and furthering the internal strife between the leaders of the fracturing Empire.Star Wars: Crimson Empire II: Council of Blood\nMeanwhile, the Yuuzhan Vong also began meddling in the high politics of the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium. They installed one of their own agents, E'thinaa, in a high-ranking military position, and manipulated the rise to power of the Keeramak, with the goal of eventually using the Ssi-ruuvi to create confusion and disorder during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion.\nIn 24 ABY, Yuuzhan Vong agent Yomin Carr infiltrated the ExGal Society, stationing himself at the ExGal-4 base on Belkadan located along Vector Prime.\nIn 25 ABY, Yuuzhan Vong executor Nom Anor struck a deal with Boba Fett to have him and a select group of Mandalorian aid the invasion force. Fett realized that openly resisting the Yuuzhan Vong would result in the enslaving of Mandalore and so he agreed. He secretly carried out a plan to aid the New Republic by allowing New Republic personnel to escape with information from doomed worlds. This resulted in the escape of the Jedi Knight Kubariet on the world of New Holgha.Boba Fett: A Practical Man\n\n\u2022 Invasion of the galaxy\n\nTsavong Lah to Leia Organa Solo\nYuuzhan Vong War\nOn the world of Rhommamool, Yuuzhan Vong executor Nom Anor, disguised as the leader of the Red Knights of Life, stirred up a war between Rhommamool and its neighboring planet, Osarian. He was also responsible for infecting Mara Jade Skywalker and a hundred other diplomats with a deadly Yuuzhan Vong disease. As a result the New Republic did not take notice when the first of the invasion force, the Praetorite Vong, made planetfall on the distant world of Helska IV and also brought down Sernpidals moon upon the planet, killing millions of beings including the famous Wookiee Chewbacca, and leaving the planet itself in pieces. The Yuuzhan Vong also encountered the Jedi, whom they started to consider the worst of a galaxy full of infidels, due in no small part to the Jedis ability to control a supernatural force that Yuuzhan Vong had been denied. The Praetorite Vong were eventually defeated by galactic heroes Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo and Lando Calrissian.\nThe main Yuuzhan Vong fleet arrived soon after though, and had in short order conquered many of the worlds in their invasion corridor. Bimmiel, Dantooine, Dubrillion and Obroa-skai were among the many worlds captured while Ithor was consumed by firestorms and rendered uninhabitable. Sheltering the refugees from planets in the invasion corridor quickly became such a problem that the New Republic government could no longer ignore the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong. The political leadership was ineffectual in countering the invaders though, and initially tried to blame the Jedi for starting the conflict with the aliens. The Yuuzhan Vong, considering the Jedi their worst enemies, capitalized on this by luring natives of the galaxy into turning in Jedi with the promise that they would be spared from the invasion. The Peace Brigade appeared as an organization of such individuals.\nThe Yuuzhan Vong also struck a deal with the Hutts that allowed them to pass through Hutt Space unmolested. But the Hutts secretly played both sides by passing information on Yuuzhan Vong fleet movements on to the New Republic. In return the Yuuzhan Vong ruthlessly conquered their worlds. In any case, moving through Hutt Space allowed the invaders to launch an attack against Fondor on the far side of the galactic core. However, they suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Fondor when Han Solo's cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo, fired Centerpoint Station against them, destroying much of the defending Hapan fleet too.\nFollowing the conquest of Duro, Warmaster Tsavong Lah offered the New Republic a cease fire if they turned over every single Jedi in the galaxy. The Jedi became hated as never before, with several planetary governments collaborating with the Yuuzhan Vong in hunting them down, and even resulting in the New Republic temporarily issuing an arrest warrant for Jedi Masters Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker.\nThe Peace Brigade also launched an attack on the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the children being trained there. The Yuuzhan Vong themselves arrived shortly after though, complicating the situation for the few Jedi remaining on the moon. The Yuuzhan Vong captured the Jedi trainee Tahiri Veila and started shaping her like the rest of their biological creations. However, before the experiment was completed, she was rescued by her best friend, Anakin Solo, with the help of the shamed Yuuzhan Vong, Vua Rapuung, redeeming the Shamed One in the process. As a result, a heretical movement that worshiped the Jedi as saviors gained popularity among the Shamed Ones (later led by Nom Anor), despite the efforts of the ruling castes to exterminate it. A short while later, the Yuuzhan Vong broke the cease fire by launching a surprise attack on YagDhul.\nTwo years into the war, the Yuuzhan Vong unleashed a new biological creation, the voxyn, for the purpose of hunting down the Jedi. In response, Anakin Solo formed an all-Jedi strike with the intent of hunting down the Voxyn Queen from which the Yuuzhan Vong cloned all the other voxyn. The mission was a success, but came at the cost of the lives of nearly half the team, including Anakin Solo himself, and also left his brother, Jacen Solo, captured by the Yuuzhan Vong. Meanwhile the Yuuzhan Vong launched an immense attack on Coruscant, conquering the capital of the New Republic and killing Chief of State Borsk Feylya. Following that, they renamed the planet Yuuzhantar, and started Vongforming the planet in the image of their long lost homeworld. The Vongforming of Coruscant was sabotaged by Jacen Solo before he escaped from captivity with the aid of Vergere. The Yuuzhan Vong began to also suffer from internal problems, as the stresses of maintaining an Empire began to tax their resources.\nThe New Republic, having moved its capital to Dac, elected Cal Omas to replace Feylya, who also created the High Council, which would coordinate the Jedis role in the war. At the same time the Jedi also found out about the NRI's secret project to create Alpha Red, a biological weapon that would wipe out the Yuuzhan Vong and all of their creations. The Jedi were unable to convince Cal Omas to ignore the weapon as a viable option for countering the invaders, but the rogue Jedi Knight Vergere saved them the trouble by destroying the project herself. However, the incident strained the relationship between the Jedi and the New Republic.\nForced to pursue conventional warfare while the Alpha Red team started from scratch, the New Republic hatched a plan to lure the Yuuzhan Vong into a trap in the Deep Core, centered around the moon, Ebaq 9. Using Jedi Knight Jaina Solo as bait, the trap was successfully sprung on the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, destroying it. On Ebaq 9, Warmaster Tsavong Lah himself was slain by Jaina Solo and Vergere sacrificed herself to eliminate the rest of the Yuuzhan Vong troops that had landed on the moon. Omas, using the political clout and fearing that the Senate would try to hijack control of the war, drafted a new constitution which stripped the Senate of executive power, turning the New Republic into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (Galactic Alliance or GFFA for short).\nAfter the victory, Luke Skywalker put together a team to follow up on Vergere's information about the living planet of Zonama Sekot. They traveled into the Unknown Regions, receiving help from both the Imperial Remnant and the Chiss, though only after having provided a service in return. Eventually they found the living planet and entered negotiations in an attempt to convince it to help end the war.\nMeanwhile, Executor Nom Anor, disgraced for his role in the disaster at Ebaq 9, disguised himself as the prophet YuShaa and began stirring up heresy on Yuuzhantar (formerly Coruscant). He heard about Zonama Sekot and succeeded in putting together a mission to the living planet consisting of himself (still in disguise), the Shaper Nen Yim, the Yuuzhan Vong priest Harrar and the two Jedi Knights Tahiri Veila and Corran Horn. The five made it to Zonama Sekot where Nom Anor showed his hand and killed Nem Yim and pushed Harrar over a cliff before trying to sabotage the planets hyperdrive. The two Jedi were unsuccessful in undoing his sabotage or preventing him from escaping the planet, but Zonama Sekot appeared to know what to do as it launched itself into hyperspace and traveled to Yuuzhantar, taking up orbit around the same star as the former capital of the galaxy.\nDuring this time, the Galactic Alliance had prepared to make a push for Yuuzhantar and take the planet back, and hopefully also break the Yuuzhan Vongs ability to wage war by taking out the Supreme Overlord. In the end, Supreme Overlord Shimrra was revealed to be nothing but a puppet for the real leader of the Yuuzhan Vong, the Force-sensitive Shamed One Onimi. Shimrra was killed by Luke Skywalker and Onimi was later killed by Jacen Solo during the second battle of Coruscant. Nas Choka, Lahs successor as Warmaster, became de facto Supreme Overlord, and ordered the remaining Yuuzhan Vong warriors to surrender.\n\n\u2022 Post-invasion\n\nOne of the terms of the Yuuzhan Vong's surrender was also that they help rebuild Coruscant to be suitable as the capital of the Galactic Alliance. The Galactic Alliance settled on Denon while construction went on, and eventually back to Coruscant after the rebuilding was complete.\nZonama Sekot also revealed itself as the seed of the long-dead original Yuuzhan Vong homeworld. After the end of the war, the remaining Yuuzhan Vong were recalled from across the galaxy to Zonama, to be contained there (except for designated Vong required to perform duties mending the harm their people had done, any who refused exile were to be put to death). Zonama Sekot, with its new Yuuzhan Vong population, disappeared back into the Unknown Regions, so that the Yuuzhan Vong could live in peace and renew their relationship with Sekot. Among other things they planned to attempt to abolish their caste system, and had already eliminated the posts of Warmaster and Supreme Overlord (though Choka seemed to remain the de facto leader of the species).\nThe Bothans, however, were unforgiving for the death of Feylya, and continued to uphold their declared state of arkrai genocide against the Yuuzhan Vong, sending ships into the Unknown Regions to hunt for Zonama. By 36 ABY their efforts had been somewhat foiled by the Galactic Alliance, which had impounded the ship detailed for the expedition.Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\nThe Yuuzhan Vong war was possibly the most devastating crisis the galaxy had faced. The cost in lives were staggering; the number of deaths over the known galaxy were estimated at about 300 trillion sentients.\n\n\u2022 The Fel Empire and the One Sith\n\nOne Sith\nLegacy (2006) 1]]\nThe Galactic Alliance gradually finished rebuilding itself a few years later, but it never would be the same as the pre-invasion New Republic. Some time after 41 ABY, as part of a move to improve relations between the Yuuzhan Vong and the rest of the galaxy, the Galactic Alliances New Jedi Order permitted Yuuzhan Vong Shapers, headed by Master Shaper Nei Rin, to use a desolate portion of Ossus, one of the orders most ancient strongholds, as a test site.\nThe intent of those who championed the project&mdash;such as Jedi Master Kol Skywalker, a leading member of the Jedi Council&mdash;was to see if Vong terraforming methods, such as those that had once transformed Coruscant into the species temporary homeworld of Yuuzhantar (27-29 ABY), could restore the barren and devastated world. Though most of the species had left for the Unknown Regions on Zonama Sekot, enough shapers remained to start a pilot program on the world. The experiment appeared to work, returning vibrant life to Ossus, and when the Jedi revealed the results to the outside galaxy, other worlds vied for the chance to restore planets the Yuuzhan Vong War had left devastated.\nUltimately, one hundred planets were chosen for terraforming. Yuuzhan Vong Shapers, accompanied by Jedi, set to work, and at first the results were wondrous to behold. Unfortunately, none had reckoned with interference by the One Sith. On the command of the cult's leader, Darth Krayt, the Sith secretly sabotaged the terraforming process on these worlds. Plants grew deformed, and painful bony growths, of a kind not seen since the Vong forcibly took populations as slaves, sprouted from the skin of the inhabitants, killing millions in the process.\nThe Jedi suspected sabotage, but did not know who was responsible. All across the galaxy, however, blame fell upon the Yuuzhan Vong. Far too much animosity still existed against the former invaders for many to believe they had truly given up their ambitions of conquest. The Jedi however, were certain that the Yuuzhan Vong were innocent, and convinced the Galactic Alliance to support the Yuuzhan Vong against domestic criticism.\nThis turned out to be too much for the Empire. The signing of the Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty (19 ABY), had brought peace between the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic, and the war against the Yuuzhan Vong had all but united the former rivals. However, the Moff Council still contained many hardliners who sought to restore the Empire to primacy as the dominant galactic power. Calling for retribution and invoking the Treaty of Anaxes, they declared war on the Galactic Alliance. The peace that so many had fought and died for in decades past was undone in a stroke, as the Sith had planned.\nFearing what could ultimately happen, the Jedi High Council ordered the creation of the Hidden Temple at the start of hostilities, its location chosen by Nat Skywalker so the Jedi could have a refuge.Legacy (2006) 25\nFrom the start, the Alliance was handicapped. Its defense of the Yuuzhan Vong had alienated numerous member worlds, whose populations still nursed bitter memories of the Vong invasion, and many of them refused to support the GA. Suddenly, the Alliance found itself facing a secessionist movement as well as general war. The Empire used this to its advantage, luring some of these disaffected worlds into the Imperial camp and weakening the GA government. Other worlds, like Hapes, declared neutrality. Thus, the war started with the Empire having all the advantages, save one: Despite this, Emperor Roan Fel himself was less than enthusiastic; he had only reluctantly declared war and thus never threw his full support behind it, even going so far to prevent his Imperial Knights from participating.Legacy (2006) 8\nIt was at this time that things were not going smoothly for the Fel Empire: despite the Alliance handicap, the Jedi were more than making up for that. Also, because Roan Fel refused to let the Imperial Knights enter the war, the Empire didnt have the strength necessary to counter the Jedi. Soon, the Sith inserted themselves into the war, offering to compensate for the lack of Force users that was the great hole in Imperial warfare. Through Moff Nyna Calixte, the ruthless and ambitious Director of Imperial Intelligence, the Sith approached the Empire and allied themselves with the Imperial cause. When the Sith then declared themselves openly, the Jedi quickly realized that it was they who were responsible for sabotaging the Yuuzhan Vong terraforming projects though the Order was never able to definitively prove it. As events progressed, even members of the Imperial regime&mdash;including Emperor Fel himself&mdash;realized the truth, that they had been used as pawns in the One Siths plan for galactic domination. Sadly by the time the true motivations of the Sith had been made clear to Emperor Fel it was far too late to halt the designs already set in motion. The Yuuzhan Vong, upon learning the truth, were at first relieved that it was not the work of their gods, were then determined to reverse the damage the sabotage had caused. Shaper Nei Rin journeyed from Ossus to try to discover the Sith's method of sabotage, hoping that this knowledge could help discredit the Sith and end the war.\nAfter three years of bloody warfare, the Galactic Alliance was a spent force, while the Sith only grew in power and strength, even independently manufacturing and fielding their own starfighters.Star Wars: Legacy (2006) 0\u00bd Imperial forces had even retaken Coruscant after more than a century. The Alliance finally surrendered, and its territory was absorbed into the Empire. It is unknown if the Empire made any efforts to exterminate the Yuuzhan Vong. The Emperor called on the Jedi Order to surrender and subject itself to the will of the Empire. Some of them did, becoming the Imperial Knights. But the rest, remaining true to the will of the Force, refused to ally themselves with the Sith and withdrew from Coruscant to their temple on Ossus. The Sith eventually followed the Jedi there. Darth Nihl, former Nagai warlord turned Sith, led a brutal attack on Ossus, aided by Imperial forces led under Moff Rulf Yage. The Massacre at Ossus scattered the Jedi across the galaxy, though the order was not yet entirely defeated. Nei Rin returned to Ossus the day after with proof that the Sith had been behind the projects sabotage, but unfortunately too late to stop either the war or the massacre.\nShortly after, the Sith, determined to rule the galaxy themselves, turned against Emperor Roan Fel and his Imperial Knights. After killing what he later determined to have been a double of the Emperor, Darth Krayt assumed the Imperial throne himself, restoring, for the first time in over a century the rulership of a Sith as Emperor, and becoming the first Sith Lord since Darth Caedus to rule over most of the galaxy.Legacy of the Force: Revelation'\nThough most of the Yuuzhan Vong who accompanied the Jedi in the Ossus Project were slain, three managed to survive where they remained beneath the Jedi Temple and guarded the remains of the dead Jedi out of respect for the Jedi Order. Master Shaper Nei Rin had been off planet investigating why the project had gone wrong, but arrived back at Ossus with her findings too late to stop the War or the massacre. Shortly afterwards, Rin, her guards, and a few Jedi who had returned to the world were hiding from an Imperial patrol under the temple when the patrols Sith commander ordered the Academy destroyed from orbit.Legacy (2006) 12 Luckily, thanks to Jedi Master KKruhk, the occupants managed to survive.\nAfter some time, it was revealed that a fanatical Yuuzhan Vong named Zenoc Quah had survived the war and had hid on Wayland for over a century before allying with the One Sith to sabotage the Ossus Project. Seven years later, he was a part of Darth Maladi's plot to overthrow Darth Wyyrlok from the rule of the Empire as well as put a new, more powerful Dark Lord at the helm. Quah and Maladi worked at creating a new weapon that would secure their hold on the galaxy from dissident Sith. For this purpose, Maladi and Quah set up a trap to capture Cade Skywalker as their test subject.\n\n\u2022 Technology\n\nHan Solo to Leia Organa Solo\nDue to their beliefs, the Yuuzhan Vong were opposed to technology, ranging from simple machines to droids, which they believed were a polluting influence. As such, all examples of their technology consisted of living biots: creatures that were born and bred for their tasks. They preferred the use of such creatures over lifeless machines which lacked any form of spirit. All Yuuzhan Vong technology, whether it be starships, weapons, or simple everyday objects, was entirely biological. They hated droids, machines, electronics, and anything manufactured. This biotechnology was coaxed into growth by the Shapers and seemed to be more resilient when compared to conventional technology.The New Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology\nNotable pieces of technology included their feared yammosks, which were called war coordinators due to the fact that they served as a biotic Battle Analysis Computer and had the capacity to coordinate Yuuzhan Vong forces to a frightening degree. Through their villips, they had managed to create a communication system that rivaled the galactic HoloNet. Different breeds of such organisms were also capable of producing living light holograms which the Yuuzhan Vong had mastered for centuries. It was known that their collision avoidance systems were as good as those of the inhabitants of the galaxy. Furthermore, their equivalent of an antenna consisted of spiral fibers embedded in a yorik coral hull to regions which were sensitive to receiving communications. In addition, they made use of nutrient feeds for various biots which served in a similar capacity as power lines did for their technological equivalents. Similar to navigation computers, the Yuuzhan Vong vessels possessed navibrains that were required to plot hyperspace jumps. Their vessels were also required to rearm themselves after combat with the process noted as being marginally better than those of the technological inhabitants of the galaxy.\nYuuzhan Vong personal weaponry included living serpentine weapons called amphistaffs that were able to alter their form allowing their user to use them as a spear or a whip. Furthermore, they wore Vonduun Skerr Kyrric armor which was capable of protecting them from weapon fire as well as lightsaber strikes. Their larger coral shaped craft made use of Yaret-Kor plasma weapons that ate through the hull of enemy ships while shielding was provided by the gravity manipulating dovin basals that generated singularities that were used to protect the craft from enemy weapon fire and were also capable of stripping the shields of enemy vessels. These organisms were grown independently and later grafted onto other organisms in an imperfect symbiosis In addition, they generated powerful gravitic fields that could also create interdiction fields that left living occupants unconscious after being pulled from hyperspace. Larger, more insidious weapons included biological plagues capable of destroying entire worlds. Some plagues were unleashed that left planetary systems barren and incapable of growing food.Legacy of the Force: Fury\nThe primary construction method through which the Yuuzhan Vong created their living vessel was through the use of yorik coral. This coral-type substance formed the hull and internal anatomy of their vessels. While several other races had mastered bioengineering, the Yuuzhan Vong were one of the few that had developed a mass production means of creating such organisms. They were capable of growing coralskippers in less than a months time, which matched the production rate of the Incom Corporation X-wing but had the benefit of not producing any waste material from normal industrial techniques. The outer skin of such craft, despite being alive, did not feel anything in the vacuum of space as the nerves were not exposed to the cold of the void. They were created to lack any nerve endings at such locations. Though the outer hull did not possess any nerve endings, the inner hull did and any breach led to alarms being raised, thus alerting the Yuuzhan Vong of intruders. Something not commonly known was that the nerves near the dovin basals were compromised due to the creatures gravitic nature. As the dovin basals were independently grown, they were nursed separately and later grafted onto their host vessels. However, the symbiosis was not perfect and the gravitic distortion created by the dovin basals desensitized the nerve clusters that were adjacent to it. Amongst warships or any other vessels, the Yuuzhan Vong compensated this problem by implanting special nerve biots around the dovin basal in order to create a complete tactile net that would not be confused by the gravitic anomaly. However, certain low priority ships were not afforded this amenity and thus created blind spots for a breaching action. Inside these ships, much of the systems had technological equivalents such as a central biotic computer like the targeting brain. However, it was sensor systems that were the most different as instead of any externally mounted observatory sensors, the Yuuzhan Vong employed a means of sensing the gravitational distortions of distant objects as a means of scanning.\nA key interface element within Yuuzhan Vong biots that linked them to their organic ships and technology were cognition hoods. These organic helmets simply slid on top of an individuals head and were connected by an organic cord linked to the ship itself. Through this contact, a pilot was capable of making a direct interface with the ship and communicating with it. This was the case either with organic pilots and droids which were capable of processing the data being sent to the hood. Onboard larger carrier ships, a central cognition hood was used by the ships commander to deliver commands to the vessel. However, should this hood be severed, then secondary cognition hoods located on smaller craft such as coralskippers were capable of sending commands from the fighter to the carrier vessel thus allowing some level of control. By wearing the hood, a pilot was capable of experiencing the memories of the ship they were linked to thus allowing them to be a part of the ship in question. Yuuzhan Vong ships communicated in the Yuuzhan Vong language which left a language barrier between foreign pilots and the vessel. However, it was possible to impart images and thoughts through the hood to the ship, thus allowing it to be controlled. A much more larger and powerful version of these biots was the cognition throne.\nSome of their more famous technologies were the amphistaff, the yorik-et, the dovin basal, the gnullith, the grashal, the ooglith cloaker, the ooglith masquer, the villip, and the yammosk.\n\n\u2022 Long-Range Weaponry\n\n\u2022 Blast bug (thrown)\n\n\u2022 Magma pebble (thrown)\n\n\u2022 Nang hul (thrown)\n\n\u2022 Plaeryin bol\n\n\u2022 Plasma Eel (thrown)\n\n\u2022 Razor bug (thrown)\n\n\u2022 Snap bug (thrown)\n\n\u2022 Yaret-Kor\n\n\u2022 Melee Weaponry\n\n\u2022 Amphistaff (mid-range)\n\n\u2022 Claws (short range)\n\n\u2022 Coufee (short range, common Chazrach weapon)\n\n\u2022 Tsaisi (mid-range)\n\n\u2022 Yuuzhan Vong in the galaxy\n\n\u2022 Nom Anor, a member of the Intendant Caste whose duties included espionage.

Onimi was a former Master Shaper who added yammosk tissue to his brain, which made him powerful though it also made him \"shamed.\" Seeing a chance of redemption, Onimi made Shimrra, an Intendant, his puppet and ruled the throne from behind the scenes. Killed by Jacen Solo.\n\n\u2022 Nen Yim, a Shaper. She traveled to the living world Zonama Sekot with Jedi Master Corran Horn, along with Tahiri Veila, Nom Anor under the guise of the Prophet Yushaa and the Yuuzhan Vong priest Harrar, where she learned that the peaceful living world Zonama Sekot is a seed of the original Yuuzhantar and that her species have gone terribly astray. She was killed by Nom Anor.\n\n\u2022 Shedao Shai, battled Corran Horn for control of Ithor and lost, although the planet was destroyed anyway.\n\n\u2022 Tsavong Lah, Warmaster of the Yuuzhan Vong. Tsavong Lah was another of the New Jedi Order's deadliest enemies. He even offered to halt the invasion if the New Republic would turn over the Jedi. He was hideous, with many organic implants built into himself. Tsavong Lah was killed during the Battle of Ebaq, during a duel with Jaina Solo\n\n\u2022 Harrar, a Priest of Yun-Harla.

He was the first to renounce his species violent ways in favor of ending the War.\n\n\u2022 Nas Choka, Supreme Commander of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, and Lah's successor as Warmaster. With the deaths of Shimrra and Onimi, Choka ordered the Yuuzhan Vong to surrender, thus ending the war.

Gorsat, nicknamed Scut, differed from other Vong in that he was raised by a human family.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong first appeared in Del Reys 1999-2003 book series Star Wars: The New Jedi Order'. They also went to appear in several other Expanded Universe products afterwards.\n\n\u2022 Early Proposal\n\nInitially, editors at Lucasfilm and Del Rey had in mind villains for the New Jedi Order of a less exotic nature, with them being villains who used the dark side of the Force. The idea was vetoed by George Lucas, who, while commenting on the story overview, pointed out that dark siders would be unable to function as a group, due to their lust for power. In his critique of the concept, Lucas forbade the story team from going in this direction, requesting that they \"be more original\" and not make the villains dark side users. This feedback soon led to the creation of the Yuuzhan Vong as unique antagonists for the series.The Essential Readers Companion\n\n\u2022 Origins of \"Yuuzhan Vong\"\n\nThe name \"Yuuzhan Vong\" was developed at a French-Thai restaurant in New York City, called Vong, which several Del Rey employees were patroning. The Yunnan region was mentioned in a list of teas on a menu that Shelly Shapiro&mdash;who was present&mdash;was reading, and the first draft of the name that would eventually be given to the intergalactic invaders was born of \"Yunnan Vong.\"Star Wars: New Jedi Order Round-Robin Interview\nThe concept of the Yuuzhan Vong's exclusive use of biotechnology came from R. A. Salvatore, and their love of pain was originally confined to Domain Shai, but this was expanded to the species as a whole, in part due to their religious beliefs and relationship to Yun-Yuuzhan, as established in the story bible.\n\n\u2022 Yuuzhan Vong and the Force\n\nAs discovered by the Jedi during the war with the Yuuzhan Vong they are apparently \"absent\" from the Force. In the book The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force by James Luceno, the reason for this is given. The Yuuzhan Vong are not \"absent\" from the Force; their entire species has been cut off from it. It is surmised in the novel that this was implemented by the intelligence of their homeworld, the seed of which would one day become Zonama Sekot, because of their war-mongering and hostile conquering of other species.\n\n\u2022 Real world inspirations\n\nYuuzhan Vong culture and religion were heavily influenced by Mesoamerican cultures. James Luceno had recently returned from a Mayan expedition to Guatemala immediately prior to the Skywalker Ranch meeting in 1998, and he had long had an interest in Mesoamerican societies. Picking up on this, Del Rey editor Steve Saffel suggested taking inspiration specifically from the eventual fates of Mayan and Aztec indigenous cultures (\"cultures of inherent tragedy\") to this effect, and he prompted Luceno with the notion, leading to Luceno filling in the rest of the story team on Mayan and Aztec cosmology and history. Luceno suggested characterizing the Yuuzhan Vong as \"tragic wanderers rather than hateful invaders\", with the notion of an invading people being a wandering tribe in search of their \"promised land,\" being directly inspired by the Aztec search for Aztl\u00e1n. The story team was receptive to the concept, with Michael Stackpole remarking, \"I specifically remember Jim Luceno saying, using the Aztecs, or the cosmology as a model, that that would work out pretty cool... And man, I concurred.\"\nFurther inspirations from, and parallels to, Mesoamerican cultures would be drawn as Luceno set to work on writing the story bible, with him specifically basing the mythology of the god Yun-Yuuzhan on that of the Aztec god Tlaltecuhtli. The idea of the Yuuzhan Vong sacrificing elements of themselves or others as offerings for the gods was directly taken from Aztec and Mayan practices and beliefs, stemming from the belief in a creator god who sacrificed themselves to create the universe. Mesoamerican ritual tattooing and body modifications to this effect also served as direct inspirations for the Vong. Additionally, Luceno would draw inspiration from the Mayan mythology of the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, for the roles of Anakin, Jacen, and Jaina Solo and the Yuuzhan Vong's mythological relationship to them.\nThe notion of the invading force first sending forth those using deception and disguise, arriving in the guise of merchants, traders, or other professions, to infiltrate, spy, and stir up trouble, as characters like Yomin Carr and Nom Anor do throughout the series, was directly inspired by the pochteca of Aztec society, who performed that function for the expansion of the Aztec Empire into surrounding lands. In addition, aspects of the Yuuzhan Vong culture, such as the Shamed Ones and the caste system in general, were inspired by the Dalit people of India, commonly known as the \"untouchables,\" as well as the caste system of Mayan society.\nThe development of the shaper caste was informed by author Greg Keyes' own anthropological background, in which he had previously explored the oral traditions and beliefs of the Choctaw people. For the shapers in particular, Keyes drew upon his experiences in Malaysia where he was exposed to elements of the indigenous culture there; in developing the shapers, Keyes looked to the ancient Austronesians for inspiration, as well as to their descendants, including the various Melanesian and Polynesian peoples. Some of the naming conventions of the shapers in his novels were drawn from names and mythologies of Pacific origin, such as for Mezhan Kwaad. Elements of these cultures also informed the look of characters like Nen Yim and Vua Rapuung, with Greg Keyes advising artist Terese Nielsen on how to depict them.\n\n\u2022 Similarities to other EU species\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong possess a number of similarities to other species that were introduced within the novels. They possess a fanaticism as the Yevetha do, a caste system similar to the Ssi-ruu, and an exclusive use of biotechnology as the Charon also do.\n\n\u2022 The Clone Wars\n\nAt Celebration Anaheim in 2015, Dave Filoni and Pablo Hidalgo revealed at their The Untold Clone Wars panel that before the show was canceled, there had been plans for the Yuuzhan Vong to potentially appear in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. Sketches of the species drawn by Filoni for the show were shown at the panel. The Vong were to be featured in a The X-files-esque episode in which the Yuuzhan Vong aboard their scout ship would perform an abduction trying to assess the strength of the Galactic Republic and what the Jedi were. According to Hidalgo, however, the story would have just implied the origins of the Yuuzhan VongPablo Hidalgo and they werent immune to the Force.Pablo Hidalgo\n\n\u2022 Similar canon species\n\nWhile the Yuuzhan Vong are no longer considered part of the Star Wars canon and are now classified as part of Star Wars Legends, a similar species known as the Grysk first appeared in Timothy Zahns 2018 canon novel Thrawn: Alliances. Like the Yuuzhan Vong, they were a threat to the Chiss Ascendancy and from whom an invasion to the galaxy would be imminent,Thrawn: Alliances mirroring the Yuuzhan Vong War from The New Jedi Order' book series. However, the Grysk did not use biotechnology, were not immune to the Force, and originated in the Unknown Regions instead of an extra-galactic location.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 \"An Apology\"\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 36]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The Unknown Regions\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 A'Kla, Elegos\n\n\u2022 A9 Vigilance interceptor\n\n\u2022 Ackbar, Admiral\n\n\u2022 Agapos\n\n\u2022 Anor, Nom\n\n\u2022 Antilles, Wedge\n\n\u2022 Azur-Jamin, Daye\n\n\u2022 Azur-Jamin, Tam\n\n\u2022 Azur-Jamin, Tinian I'att\n\n\u2022 Bel Iblis, Garm\n\n\u2022 Bossk\n\n\u2022 Bothan\n\n\u2022 Calrissian, Lando\n\n\u2022 Chewbacca\n\n\u2022 Clawdite\n\n\u2022 cloning\n\n\u2022 Corellia\n\n\u2022 Corporate Sector Authority\n\n\u2022 Coruscant\n\n\u2022 Dantooine\n\n\u2022 Darklighter, Biggs (Red Three)\n\n\u2022 Durron, Kyp\n\n\u2022 Fett, Boba\n\n\u2022 Fey'lya, Borsk\n\n\u2022 Horn, Corran\n\n\u2022 Isolder\n\n\u2022 Ithorian\n\n\u2022 Janson, Wes\n\n\u2022 Jedi Temple\n\n\u2022 Karrde, Talon\n\n\u2022 Lah, Warmaster Tsavong\n\n\u2022 Lobot\n\n\u2022 Lumiya\n\n\u2022 Massassi Temple\n\n\u2022 Mon Calamari (Dac)\n\n\u2022 Muunilinst\n\n\u2022 Myrkr\n\n\u2022 Pash Cracken\n\n\u2022 Pellaeon, Gilad\n\n\u2022 R2-D2 (Artoo-Detoo)\n\n\u2022 Skywalker, Ben\n\n\u2022 Skywalker, Luke\n\n\u2022 Skywalker, Mara Jade\n\n\u2022 Solo, Anakin\n\n\u2022 Solo, Han\n\n\u2022 Solo, Jacen\n\n\u2022 Solo, Jaina\n\n\u2022 Solo, Princess Leia Organa\n\n\u2022 Vergere\n\n\u2022 Wayland\n\n\u2022 Winter\n\n\u2022 Y'bith\n\n\u2022 Yavin 4\n\n\u2022 Yuuzhan Vong\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The Essential Guide to Warfare\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The Essential Reader's Companion\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Yuuzhan Vong",

He was known for his legendary wisdom, mastery of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and skills in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]]. Yoda served as a member of the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] in the last [[Standard century/Legends|centuries]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and as [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] oversaw the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] before, during, and after the devastating [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Following the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|First Battle of Geonosis]], Yoda held the title of [[Master of the Order/Legends|Master of the Order]] in addition to that of Grand Master. In his centuries of service to [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] and the Force, Grand Master Yoda had a hand in the training of nearly all the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] in the Order, including such luminaries as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Ki-Adi-Mundi/Legends|Ki-Adi-Mundi]] and [[Oppo Rancisis/Legends|Oppo Rancisis]], all of whom would come to serve on the Jedi Council along with him.\n\nStanding about 66 cm tall, Yoda was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] member of a [[Yoda's species/Legends|mysterious species]], details of which he did not reveal. Yoda served as a member of the Jedi Order for centuries, eventually gaining a seat on the Jedi High Council, before reigning as the Grand Master of the Jedi. He had exceptional skills in lightsaber combat, having mastered all forms and stances of lightsaber combat, except the Vaapad subset of [[Form VII/Legends|Form VII]] (he had mastered the original Form VII variant known as Juyo), but known for being particularly accomplished in [[Form IV/Legends|Form IV]], often employing the acrobatic techniques of the form. Many considered him a [[swordmaster]] and the greatest duelist in the Jedi Order, even surpassing [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] and [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]].\n\nThough arguably the Order's greatest master of the Force and most skilled warrior, Yoda believed most firmly in the importance of instructing younger generations and never missed an opportunity to ensure his students learn from their experiences. At heart, the diminutive Jedi Master was a teacher; indeed, he instructed nearly all the Jedi in the order, to some extent, during his reign as Grand Master.<ref name=\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\">''[[Yoda: Dark Rendezvous]]''</ref>\n\nThough Yoda was, arguably, the most highly Force-attuned member of the Order, he was not flawless. It was partially due to his failure to recognize that [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] was actually responsible for the outbreak of the Clone Wars, and was in fact the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] Darth Sidious, or to destroy him in battle, that the Republic was overthrown and the Jedi Order decimated. The Grand Master was among the few Jedi to survive Darth Sidious' [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]], after the beginning of which, he went into exile on the swamp planet of [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]].\n\nLater, before [[Death/Legends|dying]] and becoming one with the Force in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], the exiled Jedi Master was responsible for the instruction of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], who would use Yoda's training as a basis for the creation of a [[New Jedi Order]], after defeating the Sith.

As a result, Ikrit forsook the use of lightsabers for years afterward.<ref name=\"Vader's Fortress\">''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Vader's Fortress]]''</ref>\n\nBy around [[400 BBY/Legends|400 BBY]], when [[Beldorion]] left the Jedi Order, Yoda could be considered one of the greatest Masters in Jedi history, comparable with [[Nomi Sunrider]] or [[Thon]], both of whom had lived more than 3,500 years earlier.<ref name=\"Planet of Twilight\">{{PageNumber}} ''[[Planet of Twilight]]'', p. 187.</ref>\n\nBy [[200 BBY/Legends|200 BBY]], Yoda, along with other Jedi Masters of that time, discovered that the shape of the Force had begun to flux, becoming murky and uncertain. Studying the perplexing mystery in silent meditation, the Jedi High Council, of which Yoda was now a senior member, was unanimous: the power of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] was growing. While the Council and the other Jedi believed this indicated the growing power of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] or other dark-siders, Yoda put forth the possibility that the darkening of the Force might suggest the imminent approach of the [[Chosen One/Legends|Chosen One]], which prophecy said would bring balance to the Force. In opposition to this theory, several of the younger Jedi disputed Yoda's findings, and formed a breakaway sect&mdash;the [[Potentium]]. Their heresy was not welcomed by the Council, and Yoda led the campaign to expel them from the order in [[130 BBY/Legends|130 BBY]].<ref name=\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\" />\n\nAround one hundred and fifty [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Yoda traveled to [[Ord Cestus/Legends|Ord Cestus]] and saved the native [[X'Ting]] from disaster.

When Dooku reached the appropriate age, he was taken as a Padawan by Council member [[Thame Cerulian]]. However, even though he studied under Cerulian, Yoda took a particular interest in the young Dooku and was frequently his adviser and confidant. The Jedi Master, however, was equally quick to point out Dooku's flaws when necessary. Yoda assisted quite closely in Dooku's lightsaber training as a Padawan, and building from this foundation, Dooku became an accomplished duelist with the weapon. In Dooku's later years, only Yoda and senior Council member [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] were considered equal to his skill with a lightsaber. Later, Yoda also served as the lightsaber instructor of [[Cin Drallig/Legends|Cin Drallig]], who would become the [[Battlemaster/Legends|Battlemaster]] of the Jedi Temple.\n\n===Yinchorri uprising ([[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]])===\n====Early engagements====\n[[File:Mayvitch_soldier_contacting_Jedi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Yoda and the Council learn of the Yinchorri uprising.]]\nIn [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]], the Jedi Council received a transmission sent four standard days earlier informing them of an [[Battle of Mayvitch 7|attack on Mayvitch 7]] instigated by the [[Yinchorri/Legends|Yinchorri]]. After news of this reached [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum/Legends|Finis Valorum]], he asked Mace Windu to send Jedi to negotiate with the Yinchorri. However, the aggressive Yinchorri murdered the two Jedi sent to negotiate and sent their mutilated bodies to Valorum's [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] doorstep as a warning.<ref name=\"ActsOfWar\">''[[Star Wars: Jedi Council: Acts of War]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing this, the Council created a Jedi strike team of twelve, including senior Councilor Mace Windu, to the [[Yinchorri system]]. Reports of the Jedi's engagement with Yinchorri forces that reached Yoda and the Council proved confusing and contradictory, while the diminutive Jedi Master sensed danger coming toward him in the Force. Yoda's danger sense proved accurate when the Yinchorri launched a raid on the Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"ActsOfWar\" />\n\n====Raid on the Temple====\nThe Yinchorri task force found that all the Jedi sleeping quarters were empty. The troops then entered a chamber where they were met by several armed Jedi, including Yoda. In the end, almost all the Yinchorri were killed, and two Jedi died: [[Jude Rozess]] and [[Tieren Nie-Tan]].<ref name=\"ActsOfWar\" />\n\n[[File:Yoda_Yinchorri.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Yoda kills a Yinchorri warrior.]]\n\nYoda interrogated the last remaining Yinchorri and asked him the location of the Yinchorri high command. The soldier responded to the Jedi Master by telling him that he did not know since he was only an ordinary soldier. Yoda then turned to converse with [[Soon Bayts]], a Jedi Knight who brought word from [[Adi Gallia/Legends|Adi Gallia]] and [[Eeth Koth/Legends|Eeth Koth]] that the high command was not on Yitheeth and that they were heading to Yibikkoror to help [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]] and [[Micah Giiett]].<ref name=\"ActsOfWar\" />\n\nThese distractions gave the Yinchorri in the Temple enough time to grab his weapon and attempt to shoot the Jedi Master. Yoda, however, used the Force to throw him against a wall, killing him. The Jedi then came to the conclusion that the Yinchorri were misguided rather than bloodthirsty and that the attack may have been the work of an unknown party, rather than the Yinchorri themselves.<ref name=\"ActsOfWar\" />\n\n====Endgame====\nFollowing the unsuccessful raid on the Jedi Temple, the Jedi strike team continued to engage the Yinchorri, while Yoda remained on Coruscant. Master Windu eventually reported to Yoda, informing him that the strike team had discovered the location of the Yinchorri's high command, thanks to Master [[Yaddle/Legends|Yaddle's]] knowledge of the [[Holocron/Legends|Jedi holocrons]]. The Jedi led an attack on the world, while four navy attack groups authorized by the Senate arrived to help them, concluding the uprising.<ref name=\"ActsOfWar\" />\n\n===Invasion of Naboo ([[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]])===\n{{Quote|There's no doubt.

[[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Amidala]] of Naboo implored the help of the Republic, and as such, Supreme Chancellor [[Finis Valorum/Legends|Finis Valorum]] asked Yoda and the Council to send Jedi to negotiate with the Trade Federation, as ambassadors of the Republic.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\nThe Council sent Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], and his apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to negotiate with the leadership of the Trade Federation. However, upon the arrival of the Jedi, the Federation attempted to assassinate them and began invading Naboo; the Jedi were able to escape their would-be killers and rescue the Queen of Naboo, Amidala.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\nUpon returning to Coruscant, Qui-Gon Jinn brought a young [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] to the Jedi Council, requesting to train him once Obi-Wan Kenobi had completed the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|trials]] necessary to become a Jedi Knight, as Jedi could only have one apprentice at a time. Yoda, as the teacher of many of those on the Council, and its most venerable and respected member, played a key role in that body's initial decision to deny the request. Yoda believed that the boy was clearly affected by his years as a slave and that he still clung too tightly to the memory of [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|his mother]] to be trained safely. The boy's future, Yoda thought, was clouded. Qui-Gon, however, continued to insist that Skywalker was the Chosen One, who would bring balance to the Force.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\n====Return of the Sith====\n{{Quote|The Sith were before Master Yoda's time, were they not, Master?''\"<br />\"''Nothing was before Yoda's time, Padawan.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn|<ref name=\"CloakDeception\">''[[Cloak of Deception]]''</ref>}}\nIn addition to this supposed Chosen One, Qui-Gon brought news of the return of the Sith; while he and the Queen's entourage had been preparing to depart the planet of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] after having their damaged ship repaired, [[Darth Maul/Legends|what appeared to be a Sith Lord]] confronted the Jedi Master in a lightsaber duel.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\n[[File:Obi-Wan_Knighted_Episode_I_Canon.png|thumb|right|250px|Yoda makes Kenobi a Jedi Knight.]]\nAfter finding the Senate unresponsive to her pleas for aid, Queen Amidala demanded a vote of no confidence in Supreme Chancellor Valorum's leadership, before returning to Naboo, where she successfully led a revolt against the occupation of the Trade Federation. During this battle, Qui-Gon's mysterious attacker reappeared, and successfully murdered him, though the attacker in turn was defeated by Obi-Wan Kenobi. It became obvious to Yoda and others on the Council that the Sith had indeed returned; however, it was not clear whether the attacker Kenobi \"killed\" was the Sith Master or apprentice.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\n[[File:Anakin_The_Shadow_Trap2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Yoda with Kenobi and Skywalker during the mission to Mawan]]\nFollowing Amidala's call for a vote of no confidence in Valorum's leadership of the Senate, Naboo's own [[Senator/Legends|senator]], [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], was elected the new Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. In addition, the Council against Yoda's wishes, granted Obi-Wan, now a Jedi Knight, permission to train Anakin Skywalker as a Jedi. He vocally expressed his disapproval of the Council's decision, but reluctantly relented when he learned that Obi-Wan was willing to even go against the decision of the Council if it meant fulfilling Qui-Gon's final wish.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\nIn circa [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], the Human [[Len Markus]] seized the [[Darkstaff]], an ancient [[Dark side artifact/Legends|dark side artifact]], from the [[Cularin asteroid belt]], causing the [[Cularin system/Legends|Cularin system]] to [[Cularin's disappearance|disappear]] from [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] for ten years. The event caused a surge of dark-side energy, which was so strong that it almost hospitalized Yoda. However, despite the physical absence of the system, Yoda could sense that the star system's inhabitants were still alive.<ref name=\"Philology\">{{LivingForce|Below the Belt: Philology}}</ref>\n\n===Mission to Mawan ([[26 BBY/Legends|25 BBY]])===\nSeven years after the events at Naboo, Yoda went on a negotiation mission to [[Mawan/Legends|Mawan]] with Obi-Wan, Anakin and Yaddle. Their goal was to settle a devastating civil war between three crime gangs. These gangs, led by [[Decca Besadii Diori|Decca the Hutt]], [[Feeana Tala]], and [[Granta Omega|Striker]], caused the remainder of the population to take refuge underground. Unbeknownst to them, the chaotic planet was a trap set for the Jedi by Striker, whose true identity was [[Granta Omega]], son of [[Xanatos]]. After kidnapping Anakin, he released a deadly chemical weapon that Yaddle intercepted, killing her when she absorbed it through the Force. However, through her sacrifice, she saved the city of Naatan. The weapon was intended by its vengeful maker to kill thousands if he was betrayed by any opposition, and as his insurance to escape offworld, but it failed because of what Yaddle had done. Anakin and Obi-Wan managed to bring peace to Mawan, but Anakin still felt responsible for the death of the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] member. Yoda, despite the loss of Yaddle, still managed to convince Decca to evacuate with her illegal operations by \"suggesting\" that the Jedi Council might build a Temple on the planet, which was more than enough to make the criminal flee.<ref name=\"Jedi Quest: The Shadow Trap\">''[[Jedi Quest: The Shadow Trap]]''</ref>\n\n===Separatist Crisis ([[24 BBY/Legends|24 BBY]]&ndash;[[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]])===\n{{Quote|Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?\" <br /> \"Hmmm.

The leader of the opposition against this act was Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo. When the time to vote on the act arrived, and Amidala arrived on Coruscant, an attempt was made upon her life, though she survived.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nThe Jedi Council, disturbed by this, had Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, placed in charge of the Senator's safety. Following a second attempt on the life of Amidala, Kenobi and Skywalker captured the bounty hunter responsible, only to have her killed by a second bounty hunter, through the use of a toxic dart, during her interrogation.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nThe Council had Kenobi trace the second bounty hunter, while Skywalker was to accompany Amidala to the safety of her homeworld. Yoda helped Kenobi solve the mystery behind the missing planet [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]], where the Jedi Knight had traced the origins of the toxic dart; it was Yoda's belief that certain files had been deleted from the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|Jedi Archives]] for an unknown purpose. Even more disturbing, only a Jedi would have been capable of erasing the files.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\n====Clone army====\n{{Quote|Blind we are, if creation of this clone army, we could not see.''\"<br />\"''I think it is time we informed the Senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished.''\"<br />\"''Only the Dark Lords of the Sith know of our weakness.

Kenobi reported this to Masters Mace Windu and Yoda, the senior members of the Council, who had had no knowledge of a clone army. Obi-Wan felt certain that the template of the clone army, a bounty hunter named [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]], was the same bounty hunter who had been involved in the attempts on Senator Amidala's life.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nWhile waiting for Kenobi's report, Yoda meditated. He heard the voice of the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn and sensed that [[Mission to rescue Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|something]] had happened to Anakin Skywalker. He conferred with Windu that the young Padawan was in \"pain. ''Terrible'' pain.\"<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nKenobi traced Fett to [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]], only to be captured during his report, which detailed his discovery that Count Dooku had formed an alliance of powerful corporations into a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. This caused the Senate to grant the Chancellor emergency powers, with which he authorized the Grand Army of the Republic while Senator Amidala and Anakin Skywalker attempted to rescue Kenobi, only to be captured themselves. In response, Master Windu formed a strike team to extract the captured trio, while Yoda went to Kamino in an attempt to discover the truth of the clone army, and also to bring some of those troops to Geonosis.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\n===Clone Wars ([[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]]&ndash;[[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]])===\n====Battle of Geonosis====\n{{Quote|The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

After deflecting Dooku's Force powers, among which was [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]], Yoda realized that Dooku had turned to the dark side of the Force, becoming a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]]. A lightsaber duel began between the two, with Dooku faring well against his old master. Yet, as the duel progressed the Grand Master of the Jedi showed speed and agility so incredible that it began to overwhelm Dooku, plus he was the only one save for one other being in the galaxy that held skill enough with a blade equal or even greater than the Makashi master. Yoda almost defeated Dooku, but the Sith Lord used the Force to drop a pillar over Obi-Wan and Anakin. While Yoda concentrated on stopping the massive construction from crushing the two Jedi, Dooku made his escape.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nThough the Republic won the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|First Battle of Geonosis]] under the direction of Yoda, many Jedi were killed. More importantly, the thousand-year peace that had existed since the [[Seventh Battle of Ruusan]] had ended. Yoda sensed that the Clone Wars would be a long and tumultuous period for both the Republic and the Jedi Order, and indeed they were, shaking the galaxy to its very core.

[[King/Legends|King]] [[Alaric (Sephi)|Alaric]] of [[Thustra/Legends|Thustra]] was planning to secede his homeworld to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, although he intended to rejoin the Republic when the corruption he had witnessed was gone. Yoda traveled to Thustra to speak with Alaric, but his old friend was resolute, and eventually, his world became embroiled in battle. Unwilling to face the state of his world, Alaric drew a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] on Yoda, knowing his friend would be forced to defend himself. Left with no choice, Yoda deflected the bolt into the body of the King.

He learned through Obi-Wan Kenobi that [[Dexter Jettster/Legends|Dexter Jettster]] was a reliable informant, and soon learned to place his trust in [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]] as well after the senator revealed information of a hitherto unknown Sith planet designated [[Zigoola]].

However, the two were embroiled in an ongoing [[Battle of Christophsis/Legends|conflict]] on [[Christophsis/Legends|Christophsis]], and communications were impossible. As such, Yoda sent a youngling, [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]], to inform the pair of their new mission, and in addition, assigned her as Skywalker's Padawan.

Katuunko insisted that the Dark Jedi ensure Yoda be given a fair fight, to which she agreed. After returning to her base, Ventress contacted Dooku and stated that her forces were being deployed. She did not intend for Yoda to get his fair fight<ref name=\"Ambush\" /> and dispatched the recently promoted [[224/Legends|224]]<ref name=\"Ambush\" /> with the task of leading the droid forces, and the battle droids prepared to ambush the Republic's diplomatic squad. Led by 224 in his [[Armored Assault Tank/Legends|Armored Assault Tank]], the main column of Confederate forces advanced into the jungle. Yoda and his men made their way to the rendezvous position on a different path, as the Jedi Master was certain that their enemies were already heading toward them.

Yoda, meanwhile, was able to defeat an entire squad of droids on his own without even using his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. [[Thire/Legends|CC-4477]] was hit by a [[Missile/Legends|rocket]] fired by a [[B2-HA super battle droid/Legends|B2-HA series super battle droid]] and was wounded in the leg. Yoda appeared and aided the clones, using the Force to [[Telekinesis/Legends|turn around]] a battle droid and destroy the rest of the squad. [[Droideka/Legends|Droidekas]] soon appeared, and the Republic forces fled. Yoda, clinging onto CC-4477's back, deflected the [[Laser/Legends|lasers]] at a nearby tall formation of land coral, causing the droids to be squashed and the four escaped to a cave to rest. The clones learned that they were low on ammunition, but the Jedi Master imparted his wisdom on the clone troopers to further inspire their efforts.<ref name=\"Ambush\" />\n\nAfter hearing the sounds of the droids approaching in the distance, Yoda and the clones exited the cave. The Jedi and his men arrived on a ridge to observe the advancing droids below, which were passing through a narrow pathway. Yoda left the clones on the ridge and faced three tanks and a large number of droids alone. The Jedi Master destroyed all of them, along with 224, leaving Katuunko amused and Ventress angry. However, Ventress did not give up easily; the Dark Acolyte broke the terms of the competition and secretly sent several droidekas to deal with the Jedi Master. As Yoda destroyed the last Confederate tank, the droidekas arrived, and the Jedi Master began blocking their laser attacks. CC-4477 launched the last of the rockets at an overhanging rock above the canyon, causing an avalanche to crush the droids. Yoda then led the clones to the rendezvous point, remarking that it was not polite to be late.<ref name=\"Ambush\" />\n\nKatuunko was greatly amused by the droids' defeat. Through a holotransmission, the king informed Dooku that one Jedi was not worth a hundred battle droids, but rather a thousand, and stated that he would be joining the Republic. The count urged him to reconsider, but the Toydarian king refused to deal with those who went back on their promises, as Ventress had broken the terms of the competition. Seeing that his plan had failed, Dooku ordered Ventress to kill the king, believing that negotiations might go smoother with his successor. Katuunko's guards tried to stop the Dark Acolyte, but Ventress merely Force-pushed them aside, knocking them unconscious.

Ventress was outnumbered, and Yoda suggested that she surrender. In order to escape, Ventress detonated pre-planted explosives and caused the hillside adjacent to the Republic forces to collapse. Yoda was forced to telekinetically stop the rocks from crushing all of them, and as he did so, Ventress seized the opportunity and fled to [[Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop/Legends|her ship]]. Dooku, watching the events unfold through the holoprojector, commented before taking his leave that it was a pity that he had not been there himself.<ref name=\"Ambush\" />\n\nWith the Confederate threat over, Yoda was able to enter into negotiations with Katuunko. The king stated that discussions were unnecessary, however, as the Jedi had already proven his worth.<ref name=\"Ambush\" /> Katuunko presented his [[Ceremonial sword/Legends|ceremonial sword]] to Yoda and entrusted him with his planet's protection<ref name=\"Ambush Decoded\" /> while pledging Toydaria's support to the Republic, declaring that it would be an honor to fight on their side.<ref name=\"Ambush\" />\n\n====The ''Malevolence''====\nAfter the appearance of a [[Malevolence/Legends|mysterious Separatist super weapon]] that had ambushed several Republic fleets and left no survivors, Yoda and the Council sent one among its number, Jedi Master Plo Koon, to track down the unknown threat. After Master Koon discovered the weapon, he contacted the Jedi general in the closest system to him, Anakin Skywalker. However, during the transmission, Koon's communication systems were jammed, and the Republic lost contact with his fleet. Masters Yoda, Windu and Kenobi, in conjunction with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, agreed that sending a task force to search for survivors of the latest attack would prove risky; however, Skywalker disobeyed their orders, and through his Padawan Ahsoka Tano's unique connection through the Force to Master Koon, rescued the stranded Jedi Master and his few remaining troops. With Master Koon alive to report on the nature of the Separatist weapon, the Republic learned that the Separatists had acquired giant [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannons]] capable of disabling any fleet.<ref name=\"Rising Malevolence\">{{TCW|Rising Malevolence|Rising ''Malevolence''}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yoda_CN.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Yoda]]\nA plan devised and instigated by Skywalker proved able to destroy the ''Malevolence''{{'s}} primary weapon, and later, during a mission to rescue the captive Senator Amidala of Naboo, the giant warship was rigged to pilot itself into a nearby moon, destroying it, and freeing the Republic from the danger it represented.<ref name=\"DM\">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence|Destroy ''Malevolence''}}</ref>\n\n====Gunray's capture====\nA short time later, Senator Amidala captured important Separatist leader [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]] on [[Rodia/Legends|Rodia]]. As such, the Council sent Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Padawan Ahsoka Tano to escort the viceroy to Coruscant, where he would face trial for war crimes. While guarding the viceroy, Master Unduli was to interrogate him, in the hopes of learning important Separatist secrets.<ref name=\"CoD\">{{TCW|Cloak of Darkness}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Unduli's starship came under Separatist assault and was boarded by large numbers of droids. Though Unduli defeated the droids, she was unprepared for the far greater adversary that had infiltrated the ship: Asajj Ventress. Ventress dueled both Unduli and Tano, holding them off while her secret ally, the Senate Commando [[Faro Argyus/Legends|Faro Argyus]], betrayed his fellows and rescued Gunray. After receiving word of this, Ventress escaped the Jedi, who were left to explain the catastrophe to Master Yoda.<ref name=\"CoD\" />\n\n[[File:Council_report.png|thumb|left|200px|Fisto reports to Windu and Yoda.]]\nYoda was particularly disturbed by the betrayal of Argyus, as he felt it revealed that the Republic's enemies were everywhere. However, he supported Master Unduli's proposal that Master [[Kit Fisto/Legends|Kit Fisto]] move to recapture Gunray, his escape ship having been tracked, as the [[Nautolan/Legends|Nautolan's]] fleet was nearer the viceroy's last known position.<ref name=\"CoD\" />\n\nFisto was largely led on a wild bantha chase, however. Rather than recapturing Gunray, the Nautolan was forced to duel General Grievous and to watch his former Padawan, [[Nahdar Vebb/Legends|Nahdar Vebb]], die at the cyborg's hands. After he escaped, Fisto reported to the Council in the persons of Mace Windu and Yoda. Yoda lamented that Vebb's death was largely the result of his own hubris and feared that in the war there was a danger of the Jedi losing the very essence of who they were.<ref name=\"LoG\">{{TCW|Lair of Grievous}}</ref>\n\n====Dealing with pirates====\nSkywalker and Kenobi later launched a mission to capture the heart of the Confederacy, Count Dooku, though they were unsuccessful. However, where Skywalker and Kenobi failed, lowly pirates succeeded and contacted the Chancellor's office demanding a reward in return for the Sith Lord. Yoda confirmed that the lightsaber handled by the head of the pirate organization, [[Hondo Ohnaka/Legends|Hondo Ohnaka]], was indeed his former apprentice's.<ref name=\"DC\">{{TCW|Dooku Captured}}</ref>\n\nUnder the advice of Senator Amidala, the Council sent Kenobi and Skywalker to confirm Dooku's capture, which they ultimately did. However, Ohnaka had them captured in addition to Dooku, in the hopes of garnering a further reward from the Republic. Though Skywalker and Kenobi ultimately escaped with the help of the Republic dignitaries sent to deliver the reward, it came at the expense of the respected Senator [[Kharrus/Legends|Kharrus]]' life, while Dooku managed to escape capture.<ref name=\"TGG\">{{TCW|The Gungan General}}</ref>\n\n====Blue Shadow Virus====\n[[File:Naboo_holo_conference.png|thumb|right|200px|Yoda and Windu conferring with the Naboo]]\nLater, the Naboo contacted the Council and asked Masters Windu and Yoda to send two Jedi, specifically Kenobi and Skywalker due to their relations with the native Gungans, to help uncover a Separatist bio-lab believed to have been established on world. While the Jedi did discover the lab and prepare its resident scientist Dr. [[Nuvo Vindi/Legends|Nuvo Vindi]] for trial, a deadly virus he had prepared, the [[Blue Shadow Virus/Legends|Blue Shadow Virus]], was released, infecting Senator Amidala and Ahsoka Tano. They were administered the rare antidote before the virus could claim them.<ref name=\"BSV\">{{TCW|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)}}</ref><ref name=\"MoaTM\">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>\n\n====Ryloth====\nLater, when Master Windu led an assault on the planet Ryloth aimed at freeing the Twi'leki population from Separatist occupation, Yoda remained on Coruscant. However, the diminutive Jedi Master acted as advisor to Windu and was involved in tactical discussions regarding how to capture the capital city of [[Lessu City/Legends|Lessu]]. Yoda counseled Windu that it was important that the Separatist leader [[Wat Tambor/Legends|Wat Tambor]], who was responsible for the occupation of Ryloth, be captured to answer for his many war crimes. Ultimately, Windu agreed with Master Yoda and was able to capture the Separatist Council member at the conclusion of the [[Battle of Ryloth/Legends|Battle of Ryloth]].<ref name=\"LoR\">{{TCW|Liberty on Ryloth}}</ref>\n\n====Stolen holocron====\n{{Quote|Master Yoda, what is it?''\"<br />\"''A disturbance in the Force. Intruders there will be, in this Temple.|[[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] Yoda|<ref name=\"HH\" />}}\nFollowing the [[First Battle of Felucia/Legends|First Battle of Felucia]], Master Yoda presided over a meeting of the Jedi Council which heard that Padawan Ahsoka Tano had refused to comply with orders given to her by her superior Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. In punishment for her actions, Ahsoka was appointed as a guard of the Jedi Archives in order to spend time away from the battlefield.<ref name=\"HH\">{{TCW|Holocron Heist}}</ref>\n\nLater, while discussing the impact the defeat at Felucia would have on Republic war efforts in the region with Master Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Yoda was overcome by a disturbance in the Force which revealed to him that intruders planned to infiltrate the Jedi Temple. Kenobi and Skywalker incorrectly deduced that the culprits would attempt to steal the Jedi Order's transmission codes, and as such, focused their efforts on securing the codes. Yoda later sensed the arrival of the intruders and suggested to Kenobi and Skywalker that their enemies may head to the [[Jedi Temple communication center/Legends|Jedi Temple communication center]]. The Grand Master then met there with Masters Mace Windu, Kit Fisto and [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]] after having placed the Temple on high alert.<ref name=\"HH\" />\n\n[[File:YodaHolocronChamber-HH.png|thumb|left|200px|Master Yoda stands at the entrance to the Holocron Chamber.]]\nAs Kenobi and Skywalker tracked the intruders through the Temple's ventilation system, Master Yoda deduced that it was likely that the intruders were receiving assistance from within the Temple considering their ability to avoid the two Jedi trailing them. As such, the diminutive Master contacted Ahsoka Tano and cautioned her that he sensed deception and that there was somebody in the Archives impersonating a Jedi. Fortunately, Tano was able to subdue the impostor, a [[Clawdite/Legends|Clawdite]] [[Changeling/Legends|changeling]] named [[Cato Parasitti/Legends|Cato Parasitti]], who had been impersonating Master [[Jocasta Nu/Legends|Jocasta Nu]] and feeding her employer [[Cad Bane/Legends|Cad Bane]] information from the Jedi Archives.<ref name=\"HH\" />\n\nNonetheless, Bane's scheme worked, as he was able to keep the Jedi off his tail long enough to break into the [[Holocron Chamber]] and steal a Jedi holocron as ordered by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. However, Parasitti revealed to the Jedi that Bane's next target was Jedi Master [[Bolla Ropal/Legends|Bolla Ropal]]. This allowed the Jedi to deduce that Bane was after the [[Kyber memory crystal/Legends|Kyber memory crystal]] in Ropal's keeping, which when combined with a holocron would reveal a list of all known Force-sensitive children in the galaxy.<ref name=\"HH\" />\n\nWhile Skywalker and Tano were dispatched to protect Master Ropal, they were ultimately too late; Ropal was captured and died under torture, refusing to use the Force to help Bane unite the holocron and Kyber crystal. However, the Jedi believed that Bane himself was killed during the [[Battle of Devaron/Legends|Battle of Devaron]], though he later proved to have survived. Prior to faking his death, Bane was able to coerce Skywalker into uniting the holocron and memory crystal, and as such, the bounty hunter began collecting the Force-sensitive children on behalf of Sidious.<ref name=\"CargoofDoom\">{{TCW|Cargo of Doom}}</ref>\n\nLater, Yoda led Windu, Kenobi and Skywalker in using the Force to pinpoint which children would be targeted by Bane. Yoda sensed that a child on Rodia was in danger, as well as one on Naboo. However, when Master Windu asserted that a child from [[Glee Anselm/Legends|Glee Anselm]] was being targeted by Bane, Yoda revealed that the infant had already been claimed by the bounty hunter and that the dark side hid his fate. Kenobi proved unable to prevent Bane from capturing the Rodian, but Skywalker and his Padawan captured Bane when he ventured to Naboo.<ref name=\"CargoofDoom\" />\n\nMasters Kenobi and Windu then used Bane to relocate the stolen holocron, though the bounty hunter escaped in the process. However, even without Bane, Skywalker and his Padawan discovered a secret facility on [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]] where the captured children were hidden, and ultimately rescued them.<ref name=\"CargoofDoom\" />\n\n====The Zillo Beast====\n[[File:ForceBarrier-ZBSB.png|thumb|right|200px|Yoda, Aayla Secura, and Anakin Skywalker fend off the toxin-bombs.]]\nWhen Supreme Chancellor Palpatine discovered the [[Zillo Beast/Legends|Zillo Beast]] on [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]] and ordered it brought to Coruscant for research, it promptly escaped and made a beeline for the Senate building, necessitating the interference of Yoda and the Jedi Order. Dismissing Mace Windu's suggestion to shoot the beast down with stun rays, Yoda and Aayla Secura clambered atop the beast's back, distracting it with their lightsabers to buy Republic forces time to rescue the shuttle in the creature's grasp with Palpatine, Anakin Skywalker, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala inside. When all the shuttle's occupants were brought to safety, Yoda aided Secura and Skywalker in protecting the group from the toxin-bombs detonated to kill the beast.<ref name=\"The Zillo Beast Strikes Back\">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\n====Savage Opress====\n{{Quote|A creature from the same species he is. From Dathomir.|Yoda assures Obi-Wan Kenobi that Savage Opress is not Darth Maul.|<ref name=\"Witches\">{{TCW|Witches of the Mist}}</ref>}}\nYoda and Mace Windu later showed Obi-Wan Kenobi footage of a recent [[Devaron massacre/Legends|massacre]] on [[Devaron/Legends|Devaron]], in which Jedi Master [[Halsey/Legends|Halsey]] and his Padawan [[Knox/Legends|Knox]] were brutally murdered by an [[Savage Opress/Legends|unknown assassin]]. The footage baffled Kenobi, for he believed he had killed the Sith Lord Darth Maul, but Yoda pointed out that it was a creature of the same species from Dathomir. Yoda tasked Kenobi with going to Dathomir to find this threat and defeat it.<ref name=\"Witches of the Mist\">{{TCW|Witches of the Mist}}</ref>\n\n====Mortis communication====\nThe Jedi Council later received a mysterious transmission which was over two thousand years old. After the Council reviewed the ancient transmission, they dispatched Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano to uncover if it was a Separatist trap. As a precaution, they sent a heavily armed fleet to accompany them.\n\nWhen the trio returned, Yoda learned from Kenobi that they encountered three beings: the [[Father (Mortis)/Legends|Father]], [[Son/Legends|Son]] and [[Daughter/Legends|Daughter]], who resembled the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light]] and dark sides of the Force.\n\n====Rescue of Even Piell====\nJedi Master and councilor [[Even Piell/Legends|Even Piell]] was taken [[Capture of Even Piell/Legends|prisoner]] by Separatist forces after he recovered the [[Nexus Route/Legends|Nexus Route]] coordinates, which were crucial to the war effort. As a result, the Jedi Council set up a [[Battle of Lola Sayu/Legends|rescue attempt]], with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in charge. Ahsoka Tano also went along, disobeying orders to stay.\n\nBut the rescue attempt failed, and the team split up and later rejoined after their ship was destroyed. Yoda, Mace Windu, [[Saesee Tiin/Legends|Saesee Tiin]] and Plo Koon then set up a rescue mission for the team, with Koon, Tiin, Adi Gallia and Kit Fisto successfully extracting them; however, Piell lost his life.\n\nWith the coordinates in the hands of both Ahsoka Tano and Piell's Captain [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]], Yoda decided to meet with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, as Tano vowed to Piell to give it to the Council, while Tarkin vowed to give it to the Chancellor.\n\n====Padawan lost====\nAhsoka Tano vanished in a battle on the world of [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]]. After some time, a ship piloted by bounty hunters [[Sugi (bounty hunter)/Legends|Sugi]] and [[Seripas/Legends|Seripas]] came to the Jedi Temple with a band of [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]], and two Jedi younglings. Among them was Tano. Yoda and Mace Windu watched as Tano and Anakin Skywalker paid their mutual respects to each other in satisfaction.\n\n====Mon Calamari====\n{{Quote|To the Gungans we must look.|Yoda finds reinforcements for their stranded allies.|<ref name=\"Gungan Attack\">{{TCW|Gungan Attack}}</ref>}}\nYoda and Mace Windu then made contact with Anakin Skywalker, [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] and Senator Amidala, who were on [[Dac/Legends|Dac]] to cool down tensions between the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] and the Separatist-aligned [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]]. When Kit Fisto and Ahsoka Tano went to aid their forces on the planet, they soon lost contact after the Republic was almost decimated by Separatist commander [[Riff Tamson/Legends|Riff Tamson]].\n\nAs a result of this, the Jedi held a special session to discuss how to proceed. Saesee Tiin suggested that they find a nearby underwater race with an army to aid their allies, and Obi-Wan Kenobi pointed out Naboo. Yoda then contacted the Gungan boss, [[Lyonie/Legends|Lyonie]], who dispatched [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]] to lead the army to Mon Cala.\n\n====Aleen relief mission====\nWhen several earthquakes struck the [[Aleena/Legends|Aleena]] world of [[Aleen/Legends|Aleen]], Commander [[Wolffe/Legends|Wolffe]] and his [[Wolfpack/Legends|team]] were sent to the planet with relief supplies as well as Senator Amidala's droids, [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]]. Yoda also appeared in the transmission sent to Wolffe.\n\n====Rise of the Zygerrian Empire====\n{{Quote|What is it, Master?''\"<br />\"''Slavery, a great tool it is for the rise of the Sith.|Plo Koon and Yoda|<ref name=\"Kidnapped\">{{TCW|Kidnapped}}</ref>}}\nYoda then made contact with Governor [[Roshti/Legends|Roshti]] of planet [[Kiros/Legends|Kiros]] to warn him that he could not trust Dooku and the Separatist cause. Roshti said it was out of his hands, as the Separatists had already arrived. Yoda promised to send assistance, in the form of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka Tano along with their forces.\n\nShortly after they won a [[Battle of Kiros|battle]] there, the three appeared in holographic form alongside Admiral [[Wullf Yularen/Legends|Wullf Yularen]], who reported that he ran a scan but found none of the [[Togruta/Legends|Togruta]] colonists&mdash;who were not even on the planet.\n\n====Kenobi's \"demise\"====\nCriminal mastermind [[Moralo Eval/Legends|Moralo Eval]] hatched a scheme to abduct Supreme Chancellor Palpatine at the [[Festival of Light/Legends|Festival of Light]] on Naboo with the aid of Dooku and a cadre of bounty hunters. The Jedi tried to make a deal with Eval for information, to no avail, so devised their own plan to thwart the attack. Obi-Wan Kenobi would fake his death via assassination and pose as the killer to infiltrate Dooku's team and send them information about the attack.\n\nWhen the deed was done, Yoda attended the [[Funeral of Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|mock funeral]] for Kenobi and later visited with Mace Windu as Kenobi underwent his facial transformation. Yoda and Windu received various communications from Kenobi, and later, he told Anakin Skywalker the truth about Kenobi's \"demise.\" With the aid of Kenobi, Dooku fled, the Chancellor was rescued, and Eval, Cad Bane, [[Twazzi/Legends|Twazzi]] and [[Embo/Legends|Embo]] were apprehended in [[Theed/Legends|Theed]].\n\n====Return of Darth Maul====\n{{Quote|Master Yoda, if this is indeed Darth Maul, then his capture is far too important for Obi-Wan to handle alone.''\"<br />\"''Not alone will Kenobi be; an unexpected ally he may have. Trust the Force we must.|Mace Windu and Yoda discuss Kenobi's ability to defeat Darth Maul|<ref name=\"Revenge\">{{TCW|Revenge (episode)}}</ref>}}\nThe Jedi later received a transmission that came from the Outer Rim world of [[Raydonia/Legends|Raydonia]]. To the horror of the Jedi, the person that sent the communication was the presumed dead Sith Lord Darth Maul, the one who murdered Qui-Gon Jinn eleven years before.\n\nMaul said that if Kenobi did not face him, he would destroy the planet, after he [[Massacre on Raydonia/Legends|killed]] a group of people in the communication. Kenobi said that he could [[Skirmish above Raydonia/Legends|defeat]] Maul as he once did, and left for Raydonia. Mace Windu expressed his doubts about Kenobi's skill, but Yoda said he may gain an unexpected ally in his quest.\n\nKenobi returned, and the Jedi learned that Maul had teamed with his brother Savage Opress, the one that massacred the forces at Devaron. Many teams were sent to capture the two [[Nightbrothers/Legends|Nightbrothers]] on many worlds from [[Pleem's Nexus]], [[Orto Norwe]], [[Paklan]] and [[Moorjhone]]. Each Jedi met their end to the two Sith's blades, [[Bruu Jun-Fan]], [[Ko Solok]], [[Grohto]], [[Judd]] and [[Salmara]] all lost their lives.\n\nKenobi and Adi Gallia soon tracked the two Sith from their last known location to [[Florrum/Legends|Florrum]]&mdash;where Master Gallia was killed. Yoda, Windu, Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker met with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to inform him of Maul's return and his plans for the future, but the Chancellor dismissed it, believing that Kenobi took it too personally. Yoda reaffirmed this, but said that when they resurfaced, the Jedi would be swift.\n\n====Onderon====\nYoda attended a session of the Jedi Council when [[Onderon rebels/Legends|rebels]] [[Saw Gerrera/Legends|Saw Gerrera]] and [[Lux Bonteri/Legends|Lux Bonteri]] sent a transmission with a plea for assistance in the [[Battle of Onderon/Legends|rebellion]] against the Separatist droid army led by the corrupt ruler King [[Sanjay Rash/Legends|Sanjay Rash]], who ousted the [[Ramsis Dendup/Legends|previous monarch]].\n\nThe Council said that they would not intervene in their affairs as the planet made their intentions at the start of the war, but promised to send some of their own to train and advise them. Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano and Captain [[Rex/Legends|Rex]] were sent.\n\n====The Gathering on Ilum====\n[[File:The_Gathering.png|thumb|left|250px|Yoda, the initiates and Padawan Tano on Ilum]]\nYoda then traveled to Ilum, where he awaited Ahsoka Tano and a clan of initiates who were [[Gathering (20 BBY)/Legends|deemed ready]] to construct their own lightsabers in the ancient ritual known as the Gathering. When Tano arrived with the younglings in the [[Jedi Temple (Ilum)/Legends|temple]] there, Yoda showed his own lightsaber and explained to them what they needed to do.\n\nWhen the younglings went inside to find their own crystal, [[Petro/Legends|Petro]] was the first to come out, but Yoda was quick to point out his flaw for certainty and said that he found a crystal, but brought water to them&mdash;that is, a ''water'' crystal. He directed Petro back inside. The other younglings, [[Gungi/Legends|Gungi]], [[Byph/Legends|Byph]], [[Ganodi/Legends|Ganodi]], [[Katooni/Legends|Katooni]] and [[Zatt/Legends|Zatt]], each came out later. The students then went on to make their personal lightsabers.\n\n====Attack on the Jedi Temple====\n[[File:Epguide520.png|thumb|right|250px|Yoda presided over the trial of Ahsoka Tano.]]\nDuring the peak of the war, [[Barriss Offee/Legends|Barriss Offee]] with the help of [[Letta Turmond/Legends|Letta Turmond]] [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar/Legends|bombed the Jedi Temple]] on Coruscant. Yoda then ordered Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano to return from [[Cato Neimoidia/Legends|Cato Neimoidia]] to help investigate, refusing to trust anyone who was in the temple during the bombing. Yoda's judgement was clouded, but he still guided the Jedi as the leader of the Council.<ref name=\"TCW:Sabotage\">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)}}</ref>\n\nTurmond was captured by Skywalker and Tano. In prison, she requested Tano speak with her, saying Tano was the only one she could trust. When Turmond was strangled to death via the Force, and several clones were murdered by a lightsaber, Republic Admiral [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]] accused Tano of being the mastermind responsible for the attack. When Tano escaped the prison, desperate to prove her innocence, Tarkin ordered her captured. This resulted in a manhunt led by Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex, during which Tano lost her [[Shoto lightsaber/Legends|shoto]]-style lightsaber and escaped.<ref name=\"TCW:TJWKTM\">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref>\n\nAfter Tano eluded her master and fled to the Underworld, Yoda ordered Skywalker and Plo Koon to track her down and bring her to the temple. Tano was quickly captured by Asajj Ventress, now a bounty hunter after having been betrayed by Dooku, who agreed to help the young Padawan in exchange for a pardon for Ventress' crimes as a Sith. Tano contacted Barriss Offee at the Jedi temple. Offee led Tano into a trap by telling her she could find evidence to prove her innocence by going to a warehouse on Level 1315. There, Offee jumped Ventress, stealing her lightsabers and mask. She attacked Tano, knocking her out in front of crates of [[Nano-droid/Legends|nano-droids]] and effectively framing her for the bombing.<ref name=\"TCW:TCAJ\">{{TCW|To Catch a Jedi}}</ref>\n\nTano was eventually brought back to the temple, where Yoda reluctantly agreed to expel her from the Jedi Order and have her face a Republic military tribunal before the Senate. Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Plo Koon, and several other members of the Jedi Council were in the Senate Chambers when Skywalker brought Barriss Offee before the Chancellor, where she confessed to being responsible for the bombings and for framing Tano. In light of this revelation, Yoda and the rest of the Council personally invited Tano to rejoin the Order, but she refused and left. Yoda would regret the Council's decision and began to question the doctrine of the war.<ref name=\"TCW:The Wrong Jedi\">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>\n\n====Clone crisis====\n[[File:Yoda_Speaking_To_The_Council.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Yoda speaks with the Council about Tup]]\nPrior to the war, Darth Sidious and his apprentice, Darth Tyranus, secretly created the Clone Army with the assistance of an unsuspecting [[Sifo-Dyas/Legends|Sifo-Dyas]], who had seen visions of a conflict beforehand. When this was done, they had organic [[Inhibitor chip/Legends|inhibitor chips]] implanted in their brains. which caused the clones to do anything Palpatine told them to, in this case execute the Jedi. With one simple command, the clones would enter a trance-like state and perform whatever orders they were given.<ref name=\"TCW:Conspiracy\">{{TCW|Conspiracy}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Ringo Vinda/Legends|Battle of Ringo Vinda]], Clone Trooper [[Tup/Legends|Tup]] murdered Jedi Master [[Tiplar/Legends|Tiplar]] when his inhibitor chip was activated prematurely. Sidious ordered Tyranus to apprehend Tup to prevent the Jedi from discovering the truth. Tup was eventually sent to Kamino after Anakin Skywalker, Captain Rex, and [[Advanced Recon Commando/Legends|ARC trooper]] [[Fives/Legends|Fives]] were able to recover Tup from a Separatist Transport.<ref name=\"TCW:The Unknown\">{{TCW|The Unknown}}</ref>\n\nAfter escorting Tup to Kamino, Fives and Rex were greeted by Jedi Master [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]], alongside the main developer of the clones, Kaminoan scientist [[Nala Se/Legends|Nala Se]]. Rex returned to Ringo Vinda while Fives remained on Kamino to undergo examination in case Fives had a similar situation. Disputes over the tests led to a debate. While Shaak Ti advised a brain scan, Nala Se suggested terminating the clone and performing an autopsy to isolate the case. Shaak Ti contacted the Jedi Temple where Yoda, alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi, decided Tup should be brought to the temple to be examined through the Force.<ref name=\"TCW:Conspiracy\" />\n\nWhat the Jedi were unaware of was that the Kaminoans knew of the inhibitor chips and were working with Count Dooku, who used his Sith name, Tyranus, to prevent the Jedi from making the connection. Dooku ordered that Tup be terminated and that the chip be sent to him to be looked at.<ref name=\"TCW:Conspiracy\" />\n\nAngry at Nala Se and Master Ti for their treatment of Tup, Fives escaped the medical center and embarked on his own plan. Fives faked leaving the planet, but stayed to try and save Tup and discover the truth. He and the [[Medical droid/Legends|medical droid]] [[AZI-345211896246498721347/Legends|AZI-3]] were able to perform a brain scan on Tup, where they learned of the inhibitor chips. Fives had the droid take the chip out of his and Tup's brains. Unfortunately, the already-weakened Tup died soon after the operation, whispering his last words to Fives.<ref name=\"TCW:Conspiracy\" /> Fives blamed Nala Se for what happened to Tup. Suspecting the Kaminoans of treachery, and with the support of Master Ti, Fives insisted on presenting his evidence and the removed chips directly to Palpatine. Fives was eventually brought to Coruscant, at the request of Shaak Ti, where he was brought before the Chancellor. As the ship landed, Nala Se drugged Fives, causing him to act strange.<ref name=\"TCW:Fugitive\">{{TCW|Fugitive}}</ref>\n\nWhen Fives attempted to assassinate Palpatine, Yoda and the rest of the Jedi Council ordered Anakin Skywalker to investigate. Fives was killed in the end, and Yoda was ultimately told that the doctors had found another cause, and that a vaccination had been prepared, in case of a future incident.<ref name=\"TCW:Orders\">{{TCW|Orders (episode)}}</ref>\n\n====Uncovering the truth====\n{{Quote|Know now we do that guide the creation of the clones from the beginning, Dooku did.

Plo Koon and Commander Wolffe, sent to investigate, found the remains of a shuttle and the lightsaber of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who was killed sometime around the Battle of Naboo while dealing with a conflict on Felucia. Upon reviewing the temple archives, [[Jocasta Nu/Legends|Jocasta Nu]] and the Jedi found that the information had been sealed by order of the Supreme Chancellor. While sending Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Felucia, Yoda went to speak with Chancellor Palpatine. The latter directed Yoda to Finis Valorum, who had been Supreme Chancellor when these events took place. Anakin and Obi-Wan attempted to communicate with the native tribe on Felucia, but were unable to understand them. They did learn, however, that a second Jedi had shown up with Sifo-Dyas.<ref name=\"TCW:TLO\">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Valorum_Yoda_The_Lost_One.png|thumb|250px|Yoda meets with former Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum on Coruscant.]]\nValorum told Yoda that he sent Sifo-Dyas to negotiate with the [[Pyke Syndicate/Legends|Pyke Syndicate]] to stop a booming drug trade underneath Coruscant. Valorum also revealed that he kept this secret, fearing his opponents in the bureaucracy. The talks were postponed after the Council sent Sifo-Dyas to intervene on Felucia. Valorum was unable to identify the second Jedi, but did say that his assistant, [[Silman/Legends|Silman]], was with Sifo-Dyas when he was shot down.<ref name=\"TCW:TLO\" />\n\nEventually, Yoda dispatched Anakin and Obi-Wan to Oba Diah, where they learned the Pykes were paid to shoot down the ship carrying Sifo-Dyas, but had kept Silman captive as leverage and that Dooku was in fact the individual known as Tyranus, leading them to realize Dooku impersonated Sifo-Dyas to help push forward the Clone Wars. Yoda, not knowing how to stop the plot, suggested the Jedi keep the discovery a secret, and that they should keep playing the Sith Lord's game.<ref name=\"TCW:TLO\" />\n\n====Discovering immortality====\n[[File:YodaHearsQui-Gon.png|thumb|left|250px|Yoda hears the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn.]]\nWhile meditating during the end of the war, Yoda heard the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn, who demonstrated his presence by levitating Yoda. The encounter left Yoda distracted during the subsequent Council gathering, leaving them worried about whether the stresses of the war were finally taking its toll on him. While strolling through the Temple gardens, Yoda was greeted by Anakin. Yoda asked him about his encounter with Qui-Gon's spirit on [[Mortis/Legends|Mortis]], which Anakin had dismissed as a trick, noting the Jedi belief that one could not retain their identity after becoming one with the Force. Yoda responded that he now questioned this dogma.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>\n\nYoda confessed what happened to the Council, much to their disbelief. They agreed though to meditate with him, to verify his experience. Despite meditating together for an entire day, they were unable to hear anything. [[Ki-Adi-Mundi/Legends|Ki-Adi Mundi]] expressed worry that Yoda had become susceptible to Sith manipulation, so Yoda underwent medical tests that revealed that he was still in good health. Jedi Doctor [[Rig Nema/Legends|Rig Nema]] suggested Yoda undergo a [[Deprivation ritual/Legends|deprivation ritual]] that would allow him to meditate more strongly and find the source of the voice.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" />\n\nAgreeing, Yoda was suspended in a liquid tank with an [[Breath mask/Legends|oxygen mask]] to bring him as close as possible to death without actually becoming one with the Force. While unconscious, Qui-Gon's voice requested Yoda go to [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]], and to tell no one about it. After, Obi-Wan broke open the tank due to his concern over Yoda's failing life signs.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" />\n\nPut on bedrest and under guard, Yoda convinced Anakin to help him escape by posing as simply accompanying each other for a walk. Guided to the Jedi Temple Hangar, Anakin lent Yoda his [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]] R2-D2 to accompany him to his [[Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor/Legends|personal interceptor]]. Yoda and R2-D2 flew to Dagobah, where Yoda asked the droid to stay with their ship while he found a clearing to meditate.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" />\n\n[[File:YodaDagobahLight.png|thumb|250px|Yoda communes with Qui-Gon on Dagobah.]]\nQui-Gon's voice greeted him. Yoda asked why he could not see him. Qui-Gon explained he had not been fully trained enough to do so. The Living Force appeared to Yoda in the form of [[Firefly/Legends|fireflies]], guiding Yoda to a [[Cave of Evil/Legends|cave]] strong with the dark side, it showed the Jedi Master a vision of the future, where a hooded Sith Lord slaughtered the Jedi. Qui-Gon explained to a distraught Yoda that he would help him bring hope for the future, and directed him to the planet that spawned the midi-chlorians.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" /><ref name=\"TCW:Destiny\">{{TCW|Destiny (The Clone Wars)}}</ref>\n\nArriving there, Yoda gave his lightsaber to R2-D2 for safekeeping, and descended into the world to meet the [[Force Priestesses/Legends|Force Priestesses]], who agreed to teach him how to achieve life after death. First, Yoda confronted a manifestation of his own dark side, conquering his hubris. Next, he witnessed a vision of the Jedi massacred in the Temple, where an apparition of Katooni invited him to enter a peaceful courtyard to escape these painful events. Seeing Qui-Gon, Kenobi, Ahsoka and Dooku together, alive and full Jedi, Yoda recognized the vision's falsehood, overcoming its temptation and his attachment to those that have fallen.<ref name=\"TCW:Destiny\" />\n\n[[File:EpGuide613.png|thumb|left|250px|Yoda sees the specter of Darth Bane.]]\nInstructed to complete his tests on the Sith homeworld of [[Korriban/Legends|Moraband]], Yoda and R2-D2 [[Mission to Moraband/Legends|flew]] to the [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|valley]] where the ancient Sith Lords were buried. Recognizing the danger, Yoda instructed R2-D2 to return to the Jedi Temple and inform the Council of what happened, if he did not come back after three nights. Spectres of a serpent, [[Zombie/Legends|undead]] Sith warriors and even [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]] himself confronted him, but Yoda brushed them off. As he entered a temple execution chamber, the Force Priestesses warned Yoda that whatever he encountered there would be beyond their control.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\">{{TCW|Sacrifice (episode)}}</ref>\n\nUnknown to Yoda, Darth Sidious and Dooku sensed his presence on Moraband, and met in an abandoned tower in the industrial sector of Coruscant. Using Dooku and Yoda's [[Force-bond/Legends|Force bond]], Sidious planned to reach out to Yoda and crush his spirit. Appearing to Yoda in the form of Sifo-Dyas, Sidious had Yoda wake up in a [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry/Legends|Republic attack gunship]] with Anakin and members of the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]], en route to terminate the Sith on Coruscant. As they arrived, the clones, led by Captain Rex, rushed at Dooku only to be hit with Sith lightning. Anakin immediately attacked Dooku while Sidious fled. Walking sadly past the fallen clones, a dismayed Yoda witnessed Anakin decapitate Dooku. However, he left Anakin and pursued Sidious.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" />\n\nEmerging on a catwalk, Yoda and Sidious ignited their lightsabers and engaged in a fierce duel that took them further away from the industrial tower. Anakin eventually caught up with the pair, engaging Sidious in lightsaber combat alongside the Grand Master. Yoda was able to throw Sidious away from them with a Force push, but Anakin foolishly took the chance to attack Sidious while he was still on the ground. The Dark Lord rose to his feet and immediately proceeded to Force-choke Anakin before rendering him unconscious with Force lightning. Sidious then turned his lightning upon Yoda, who immediately began to deflect it with his bare hands by using tutaminis, advancing upon Sidious and closing the gap between them. Although both struggled with the effort of overcoming the other, Yoda was able to cause Sidious to begin to slowly reel backwards with the strength of his counterattack before the combination of their powers caused an explosion that blasted them apart. Sidious was sent toppling over the catwalk's banisters while Yoda was able to maintain his ground. Yoda immediately looked for a seemingly vanished Sidious only to witness the latter damaging the catwalk with his lightsaber from below. Yoda leapt after him, but Yoda's attention soon became divided between Force-lifting Anakin to save him from falling to his death and blocking Sidious' Sith lightning with his lightsaber. After Sidious taunted him by suggesting he sacrifice Anakin to concentrate on defeating him, Yoda put down his lightsaber to ensure Anakin's safety only to be hit with lightning. As the catwalk collapsed, Yoda maneuvered Anakin to safety and prevented Sidious escaping by severing the collapsing catwalk with his lightsaber, dragging Sidious down too. The incident proved Yoda's selflessness and demonstrated his resolve to Sidious, who concluded the illusion as he realized it would take more to defeat the Jedi Master.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" />\n\nYoda awoke and was greeted by a Priestess, who explained he would continue his training with Qui-Gon's spirit. As she disappeared in a glow of light, Yoda had a vision of the future, including his own death.<ref name=\"SW-Sacrifice Episode Gallery\">{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/sacrifice-episode-gallery|text=\"Sacrifice\" Episode Gallery}}</ref> Yoda returned to the Jedi Temple, where Windu and Kenobi greeted him in the garden. Yoda claimed his journey had been uneventful, but wondered if Jedi had been wrong to wage the war on the Republic's behalf.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" /> (Though, despite his fears, he never gave up opposing the Sith.)<ref name=\"ROTJn\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith novelization\" />\n\n====Vjun====\n[[File:MissionToVjun.jpg|thumb|200px|Yoda during the [[Mission to Vjun (Clone Wars)|mission to Vjun]]]]\nNear the end of the war, Yoda journeyed to the planet [[Vjun/Legends|Vjun]] after receiving a communication from Count Dooku, stating his intention to defect. Although Yoda was well aware of Dooku's treachery, he could not help but hope the count's plea was sincere, and that his former student was, at last, trying to find his way home.\n\nTaking Jedi Masters [[Maks Leem]], [[Jai Maruk]], and their Padawans [[Whie Malreaux/Legends|Whie Malreaux]] and [[Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy]], Yoda traveled secretly to Vjun. However, along the way, Asajj Ventress tracked and captured the foursome, and unleashed new assassin droids. Killing Leem and Maruk, Ventress tried to destroy the [[Phindar Spaceport|space station]] to kill Yoda. The little green creature, using the help of his [[Palleus Chuff|media doppelg\u00e4nger]], destroyed Ventress' [[Last Call (Ginivex-class)|ship]], allowing them to escape. Yoda rendezvoused with Dooku in [[Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux]] and confronted the Sith Lord over his choice to join the dark side. Dooku attempted to convert Yoda, but the Jedi Master easily pushed aside Dooku's hollow promises. Instead, Yoda tried to persuade Dooku to rejoin the Jedi Order, and it appeared his words had a profound effect on Dooku. The unexpected intervention of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker hardened Dooku's resolve, however, and Yoda was forced into a second duel with the count. Just as their duel on Geonosis, Yoda's fallen apprentice showed proficiency in lightsaber combat nigh akin to his own, even managed to pierce the Jedi Grandmaster's centuries worth of lightsaber knowledge by delivering a small blow that passed by his defenses. Both Yoda and Dooku survived, but each left the confrontation once again before the victor could be determined with much on their minds.<ref name=\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\" />\n\n====Argul====\nWhen fierce [[Battle of Argul|fighting]] broke out on the planet [[Argul]], Yoda traveled to the world with a number of other Jedi, to help evacuate refugees from Argul's cities. However, there were not enough transports for the Jedi to evacuate all of the [[Argullian]]s, so Yoda left the planet, promising to return with more ships.<ref name=\"OtF\">\"[[Only the Force]]\"</ref>\n\n{{RPG}}\nYoda commandeered the [[Sullustan task force]] and returned to Argul with the fleet, using it to reinforce Republic forces on the planet. The task force quickly turned the tide of the battle in the favor of the Republic, and Yoda landed with the reinforcements, via a gunship. He then congratulated the surviving Jedi on the world, for their efforts during the battle.<ref name=\"OtF\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n====Bpfasshi Dark Jedi crisis====\nEarly in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Yoda led a Jedi task force to confront the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] crisis on the planet [[Bpfassh]]. A group of [[Bpfasshi/Legends|Bpfasshi]] Dark Jedi were responsible for a rampage of terror and destruction throughout the [[Bpfassh system]] and, indeed, the entire [[Sluis sector/Legends|Sluis sector]]. The task force was able to stop the insurrection and quell the uprising.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)\">[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]</ref> Yoda then personally engaged the last of the Bpfasshi Dark Jedi, who survived the Jedi intervention and managed to escape, commandeering [[Jorj Car'das]]'s smuggling ship, in a duel that lasted a day and a half, before finally defeating him<ref name=\"VotF\">''[[Vision of the Future]]''</ref>&mdash;or so it seemed.

He did, however, journey to [[Cato Neimoidia/Legends|Cato Neimoidia]] shortly before the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|Battle of Coruscant]] to investigate the discovery of Nute Gunray's [[Mechno-chair/Legends|mechno-chair]].<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\">''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the Battle of Coruscant, Yoda again rode his kybuck into battle, to support the forces of [[Fordo|Captain Fordo]] with a dazzling display of [[mounted lightsaber combat]]. He eventually sent the creature back to the Temple, and continued to fight, side by side with Mace Windu, on foot.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" />\n\n[[File:YodaMaceCoruscant.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Yoda and Mace Windu realize [[Palpatine/Legends|who the Separatists are after]] during the attack on Coruscant.]]\nDespite their efforts, the Jedi were unable to prevent the capture of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]], though Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi later rescued him and killed Dooku in the process. With his hopes of converting his pupil back to the light dashed, Yoda set his focus on tracking down the last Sith Lord, though tensions between the Jedi High Council and the [[Office of the Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Office of the Supreme Chancellor]] were high.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith novelization\">[[Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'' novelization]]</ref>\n\nIn 19 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine appointed Anakin to the Jedi Council as his own representative. Again, the Council was hesitant about Skywalker's temperament but, in turn, acquiesced to the request. Yoda once more played a significant role in the young Jedi's ascension in the order, as they denied Anakin the rank of Jedi Master. During that discussion, the clones reported that the Wookiees were under attack, and Yoda, having once been the planet's [[Jedi Watchman/Legends|watchman]], decided to venture to Kashyyyk to assist them.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n====Invasion of Kashyyyk====\n{{Quote|I fear the dark cloud of the Sith shrouds us all.|Yoda|<ref name=\"CW20\" />}}\n[[File:Overlooking_the_Chaos.png|thumb|250px|Yoda observing the [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|Battle of Kashyyyk]]]]\nYoda was quite skilled in the technique of [[Battle meditation/Legends|battle meditation]] and would use this to some effect during the [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|Battle of Kashyyyk]], assisting the Wookiees and clones as they fought the Separatist army.<ref name=\"The Hidden Enemy\">''[[Star Wars: Republic: Hidden Enemy]]''</ref>\n\nWhile Yoda was on Kashyyyk, Darth Sidious ordered the clones to execute [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], which meant the extermination of all Jedi. Yoda sensed his Jedi brethren being killed all over the galaxy and, coming to the only logical conclusion for so many concurrent deaths of his fellow Jedi, he suddenly realized, in one horrible instant, that the clone troopers were responsible. Worst of all, before the attack began, he felt Anakin Skywalker's ascension into Sidious's new apprentice, Darth Vader. Despite being filled with grief, he was still able to defend himself, [[Sai cha/Legends|decapitating]] [[Clone Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Gree (clone trooper)/Legends|Gree]] and [[Unidentified clone scout trooper|his assistant]] with a single strike and stop the rest of [[9th Assault Corps/Legends|his former troops]] from assassinating him. With help from the Wookiees [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] and [[Tarfful/Legends|Tarfful]], Yoda, like fellow Jedi [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]], survived and was able to escape to meet with another surviving Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Senator Bail Organa of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]].\n\n====Dark revelations====\n{{Quote|In a dark place we find ourselves&hellip; and a little more knowledge might light our way.|Yoda|<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />}}\nYoda and Kenobi then [[Infiltration of the Jedi Temple/Legends|went]] to the conquered Jedi Temple so they could reconfigure the emanating signal that was drawing Jedi survivors back to Coruscant into a trap. They disabled the deadly beacon after cutting through several clone troopers, and saw the Temple littered with the bodies of fallen Jedi, including younglings, who had been slaughtered with a lightsaber.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n[[File:Pg3_saber_bg.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Yoda fights his way into the [[Jedi Temple/Legends|Jedi Temple]], now in the hands of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]].]]\n\nAs Kenobi finished recalibrating the coded signal, he felt he must know who was responsible for the attack. Yoda, knowing that the revelation of Anakin's turn to the dark side would cause Kenobi pain, cautioned him before his fellow Master activated the security recordings. As they watched, they learned of Palpatine's Sith identity and that the Republic was now a [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. They agreed that the two Sith Lords needed to be destroyed. Yoda would remain on Coruscant to confront the newly crowned Emperor in the [[Senate Building/Legends|Senate Building]], while a deeply reluctant Kenobi would battle his former apprentice.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n====Duel in the Senate====\n{{Quote|I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend&hellip; at last, the Jedi are no more.''\"<br />\"''Not if anything to say about it, I have! [&hellip;] At an end your rule is, and not short enough it was.|Darth Sidious and Yoda|<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />}}\nAs Sidious waited for word from his apprentice, Yoda entered the office. Quickly dispatching Sidious' guards by Force-pushing them into the wall, Yoda confronted the Sith Lord, who seemed surprised at his survival and attacked Yoda with Force lightning. Yoda quickly fought back with a [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force push]] that sent the Sith Lord across the room and into his chair, where he fell onto the ground in a crumpled heap. As Sidious tried to flee, Yoda jumped in front of him and pulled out his lightsaber. Sidious then drew his own lightsaber, and the duel began.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n[[File:YodaDuel.jpg|thumb|200px|Yoda and Darth Sidious [[Skirmish in the Senate|duel]] in the [[Grand Convocation Chamber]].]]\nThe [[Skirmish in the Senate|duel moved into the Senate]], where the two Force users engaged in a saber duel in the Chancellor's podium. The two at first stalemated each other, but Yoda ultimately started to gain the upper hand, pressuring Sidious by using his small size to easily avoid the latter's strikes and to nimbly navigate through the podium,<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" /> whereas Sidious was hampered by the podium's tight space. Not allowing a moment's rest for Sidious, Yoda flurried around the Sith with his centuries worth of lightsaber knowledge, hitting with pristine determination to end this here and now. Eventually, Yoda [[Sun djem/Legends|dislodged]] the Dark Lord's lightsaber from his grip and would have slain the Sith if not for a desperate bolt of Sith lightning forcing him back.<ref name=\"ROTS junior novel\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (junior novelization)|''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' junior novel]]</ref> After retreating to the surrounding Senate pods, Sidious changed tactics and began using the Force to hurl several Senate Hoverpods at him from above, forcing Yoda to concentrate on dodging the improvised projectiles instead of getting to Sidious's level. The [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master of the Jedi Order]] and the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] were counterpoised.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\nAs the duel progressed, during a match between the embodiments of the light and the dark, Yoda realized the Jedi had lost the war before it even started. In the last millennium, the Sith had changed and adapted, becoming a new entity; while the Jedi Order, under his leadership, spent the same time merely training to re-fight the ''last'' war. Moreso, he sensed that while he was weakening, Sidious was only growing stronger. Hence, Yoda realized that the longer the duel continued, the greater the gap between his power and Sidious' would become. For while both of them were elderly avatars of the dark and light side, Yoda was ancient at nearly 900 years while Sidious, still old, stood at the beginning of his 60s. If he was to win at all, he had to end the duel, and quickly.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith novelization\" /> As Sidious continued his telekinetic assault, Yoda caught one of the Senate podiums and flung it back at Sidious, who leapt out of its path to a lower Senate pod. Yoda took the opportunity to engage the distracted Dark Lord at close quarters once again, but Sidious fired a torrent of Force lightning at Yoda. The attack tore Yoda's lightsaber from his hand, and the diminutive Jedi was forced to use tutaminis to withstand the Dark Lord's lightning.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" /> As Sidious increased the power of his lightning and aimed his attack above Yoda's defense by elevating his body, Yoda began to falter. As Sidious intensified his attack further, the Jedi Master's vision pierced the veil of the dark side, and he was able to see a glimpse of the future. What he might have seen was unclear, but Yoda's vision certainly did reveal to him that, if the galaxy were ever to be free of the Sith, he had to remain alive.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith novelization\" />\n\nYoda's newfound hope gave him the strength to resist Sidious's might, and he quickly managed to [[Force deflection|coalesce]] the energy of Sidious' lightning into a blue orb, slowly redirecting it back to an astounded Sidious, who was slowly being pushed back by the strength of Yoda's counterattack. But just as Yoda appeared to be on the brink of succeeding, the combination of both of their powers caused the orb to explode, and the blast blew them both apart, ending the battle. Both Masters were able to grasp the edge of nearby Senate pods, with Sidious barely managing to right himself and achieve the high ground. Yoda, however, was unable to maintain his grasp, and fell to the floor of the Senate Chamber. Realizing that any chance he had to defeat Sidious was gone with his stamina exhausted and his body battered, Yoda decided to flee and escaped through several service pipes, with his small size proving advantageous in this moment, and met up with Bail Organa, who hurried him away in [[XJ-2 airspeeder|his speeder]] as Yoda mused about his failure. The two left for the [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] colony of [[Polis Massa/Legends|Polis Massa]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n===Exile ([[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]&ndash;[[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]])===\n{{Quote|Into exile I must go.

He also regrouped with Kenobi, who had defeated but not killed Vader. Kenobi brought with him a badly injured Amidala, who was treated in Polis Massa. Although Amidala bore twins, Luke and [[Leia Organa Solo/Legends|Leia]], she died soon afterward. Yoda decided that the babies were strong in the Force.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />\nWhen returning to the [[Sundered Heart/Legends|''Sundered Heart'']] with Bail Organa and reuniting with Obi-Wan Kenobi, he decided that Luke and Leia&mdash;the Skywalker children&mdash;should be hidden from Darth Vader and Darth Sidious in secret locations. Other than the ancient Jedi Master, only the Organas, the Lars, and Kenobi would know of their placement. He also told Obi-Wan that an old friend, Master Qui-Gon Jinn, had found a way to retain one's consciousness after death, and would teach both of them this skill. Yoda would take on a role he had not played in centuries: that of an apprentice.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith novelization\" />\n\nDuring the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]], Yoda stowed away aboard an automated Polis Massan&ndash;registered barge that was transporting grain to starving inhabitants of the ex-Separatist world of [[Sluis Van/Legends|Sluis Van]]. The ship briefly dropped out of hyperspace near the planet Dagobah. Undetected and unrecorded, Yoda launched [[E3-standard starship lifeboat/Legends|his escape pod]] and landed on the swamp planet. He would spend his entire exile hiding on Dagobah, from the onset of the [[Imperial Era/Legends|Dark Times]] to the early period of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"e3lifeboatdatabank\">{{DB|starship|yodaescapepod|Yoda's escape pod}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TheCave-SWGs7.jpg|thumb|180px|Yoda experiences a vision of Darth Sidious in the Dark Side Cave]]\nYoda soon found and healed the badly wounded smuggler Jorj Car'das, who had been wounded by a survivor of the Bpfasshi Dark Jedi insurrection.<ref name=\"VotF\" /> After a revived Car'das left Dagobah, Yoda made [[Yoda's Hut/Legends|his home]] near the Dark Side Cave, which, in addition to the massive number of lifeforms (which masked his presence in the Living Force), counteracted his presence in the light side. Yoda's imprint on the Force was hidden, as was his sanctuary from the Emperor's sinister agents.<ref name=\"HeirtotheEmpire\" /> Moreover, Dagobah was one of the thirty-seven planets erased from the Jedi Archives, further ensuring his anonymity.\n\nAt some point, he encountered [[the Children]], a group of cannibals whose parents had been part of a Republic survey team that became stranded on the planet decades earlier. For some reason, the Children became extremely afraid of him and called him the \"Imp.\"<ref name=\"Galaxy of Fear: The Hunger\">''[[Galaxy of Fear: The Hunger]]''</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, [[Qu Rahn/Legends|Qu Rahn]], another Jedi who survived both Order 66 and its aftermath, went to Dagobah and was taught many skills by the old master.

Before entering, Starkiller met Yoda, although he was oblivious to the diminutive creature's identity. Despite his vague comments, Yoda assured the clone that his path clearly brought him to the cave and venturing inside would yield some answers for him. After Starkiller exited the cave, Yoda told him that he had to follow his destiny, to which the clone said he would follow it to the ends of the galaxy.\n[[File:Yoda_2014_NationalChampionship_PrizeCard.png|thumb|left|200px|Yoda practices his lightsaber skills in exile on Dagobah.]]\nBy this time, Emperor Palpatine increased the bounty on Yoda by a further 30,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard/Legends|credits]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]'', [[Wikipedia:PlayStation 3|PS3]]/[[Wikipedia:Xbox 360|Xbox 360]] Yoda Databank entry</ref> Due to multiple attempts at collecting the reward through fraud, the Empire had to modify the conditions so that no one else would be tempted to cheat the Empire. First, the reward was only good for a living subject. Second, a non-negotiable death penalty was attached to the bounty and would be enforced on anyone who tried to collect the reward by handing over a \"false Yoda.\" The Empire also used the fate of [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Rurrk Ca'rivv]] to remind others that Imperial authorities were quite capable of telling the difference between a Jedi Master of advanced age and a dead [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] stripped of his clothing and surgically altered, noting the smell as the first and most obvious sign of deception. Shortly thereafter, Yoda was listed one of eight of the Empire's most wanted criminals, alongside Alderaanian [[Princess/Legends|Princess]] Leia Organa, former Mon Calamari senator [[Meena Tills/Legends|Meena Tills]], and Obi-Wan Kenobi, of which they were often issued in recruitment videos for stormtroopers and the Imperial Army.<ref name=\"Be a Stormtrooper: part 1\">{{YouTube|8GuG6YOcDNU|TDL : New STAR TOURS\u3010BE A STORMTROOPER\u3011. \u65b0\uff65\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\uff65\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u30ba\u3010\u3055\u3042\u3001\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30e0\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306b\u306a\u308d\u3046\uff01\u3011|channel/UCzKgCU4TYHyfdOkwBFxtkuQ|couperin9||archivedate=20210419074436}}</ref>\n\nOne day around [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Jorj Car'das suddenly showed up once more on Dagobah, violently demanding that Yoda put his failing health right. Yoda simply took his blaster and the [[Beckon call/Legends|beckon call]] from his ship and flung them into the swamp, then berated Car'das for wasting the second chance he had been given. He also told Car'das that he couldn't help him any further, since he was busy preparing for the most important training he would ever lead. Car'das became so embarrassed by his own actions that he couldn't return to his group, so he fled to [[Exocron]], where Yoda had indicated he might receive help from the [[Aing-Tii/Legends|Aing-Tii]] monks.<ref name=\"VotF\" />\nAt some point during his exile, Alliance historian Major [[Arhul Hextrophon/Legends|Arhul Hextrophon]] discovered Yoda's whereabouts and traveled to Dagobah to find him. Yoda originally intended to wipe his mind but in the end decided against it, since it was not the Jedi way to cause pain and suffering&mdash;in this case, through the loss of memory. Hextrophon was instead made to swear not to reveal his existence. He erased the records which led him to Yoda in the first place, and apart from keeping logs in his private journal, it is believed he kept his word.<ref name=\"Star Wars Sourcebook\">''[[The Star Wars Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\n====The next Skywalker====\n{{Quote|Try not.

He also warned Luke before returning to his hut that Luke must avoid the water as there were many dangers in the swamps of Dagobah. Upon Luke's arrival at the hut, Luke expressed his irritation at his not encountering Yoda yet, causing Yoda to voice his doubts to Obi-Wan Kenobi's ghost about whether training Luke was a good idea. Yoda reluctantly agreed to train him in the ways of the Force, after Luke realized the creature ''was'' Yoda and pledged to train under him, as well as Obi-Wan's reminder to Yoda that Obi-Wan himself was also reckless and impatient when he was younger. He expressed caution, though, as he sensed in Luke traits similar to his father and judged him too old for training.\n\n[[File:YodaTrainingLuke-TESB40.png|thumb|left|200px|Yoda training Skywalker in concentration.]]\nThe experienced Jedi Master expedited Luke Skywalker's Jedi training to fit in the limited time they could afford. At one point Yoda sent Luke Skywalker to fight the Dragonsnake King in order to humble the beast and casually reminisced with R2-D2 during the battle, before [[Telekinesis/Legends|using the Force]] to help the droid avoid harm and strike the beast with electricity--this was later shown to be a ploy by the old Grandmaster to ensure the beast would be dethroned as it was too large and powerful and had unbalanced the ecosystem.<ref name=\"Treasure\">''[[Star Wars Adventures: Luke Skywalker and the Treasure of the Dragonsnakes]]''</ref> Yoda taught Luke new ways of using the Force, such as [[Short-term memory enhancement|short-term memory enhantment]],<ref name=\":0\">''[[Dark Force Rising]]''</ref> and deepening Luke\u2019s telekinetic abilities. However, prior to finishing his instruction, Luke chose to leave Dagobah without completing his training in order to confront Darth Vader at [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] above [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]] and save his friends. Yoda and the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi attempted to convince him to stay, thinking Luke ready to face neither Vader nor the revelation to come. Skywalker promised to come back in order to complete his training. Obi-Wan was concerned about this decision, telling Yoda that Luke was their last hope. Yoda quickly reminded Kenobi that hope still remained in the person of \"another,\"<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\" /> namely Leia Organa, Luke's sister.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" />\n\nAfterwards, Yoda reflected on the events that led to that point. Although he knew that the Jedi Council was all but gone, and that his own age meant he would soon die, he nonetheless was still a Jedi Master, and even during the Dark Times, he believed the struggle would continue, with droids and aliens such as R2-D2 and Chewbacca, respectively, fighting the Empire. He also noted that Leia Organa, one of the leaders of the Rebel Alliance, resembled her mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and noted that an imprint on the parent was always strong. However, he grew concerned regarding Luke and Vader, noting that the imprint was not always a good path, and that Luke could become an agent of evil should he follow the same path as his father. But he also noted that Luke was both strong and good-hearted, which might mean that not only would he not turn to the dark side, but also that Anakin Skywalker might be redeemed. He then proclaimed his faith in the light side and the return of the Jedi Knights.<ref name=\"Power of the Force\">[[Star Wars: The Power of the Force (comic)|''Star Wars: The Power of the Force'' comic]]</ref>\n\n====Death====\n{{Quote|Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall.

He informed Luke that his training was complete, but that his final test would be to face Darth Vader. He proceeded to confirm that Darth Vader was his true father, and scolded him for recklessly fighting Vader on Cloud City. He also told Luke that he should not underestimate Darth Sidious, and that he should pass on what he had learned, as the Force ran strong within Luke's family. With his final breaths, Yoda struggled to tell Luke his final words: \"Luke. There is another Skywalker.\"\n\nYoda then died and dissipated as he became one with the Force. Darth Sidious eventually discovered Yoda's demise by probing Luke's mind when he was brought aboard the second Death Star, and proceeded to mock the deceased Jedi Master, while Vader reacted without any emotion at the news.<ref name=\"ROTJn\">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (novelization)|''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' novelization]]</ref> At the celebration after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Luke would look upon the [[Force ghost/Legends|specters]] of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his redeemed father.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|When you look at the dark side, careful you must be; For the dark side looks back.|Yoda to [[Whie Malreaux/Legends|Whie Malreaux]] and [[Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy]]|<ref name=\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\" />}}\n[[File:JediGhosts-ROTJ.png|thumb|left|250px|Yoda as a Force ghost]]\nDoubtlessly, Yoda was one of the most gifted Force users in the history of the Jedi Order. Aside from his mastery of the Force, his most noticeable attributes were leadership and a very long lifespan. With almost a millennium of life, Yoda was able to establish himself as the most venerated Jedi Master throughout the entire Order&mdash;a status that would remain solely his for centuries until the fall of the Republic. As the reigning Grand Master for many centuries, Yoda had essentially become the \"face\" of the Jedi. As [[Etain Tur-Mukan]] mused, \"Yoda was the Jedi Order,\" making it impossible to criticize him without sounding blasphemous.\n\nIronically, in this regard, Yoda had more in common with his Sith counterpart, Darth Sidious, than he realized. As Sidious was regarded as the vital and infallible leader of the Sith, so too was Master Yoda the vital and infallible leader of the Jedi Order. Thus, neither Yoda or Sidious could be criticized without their critics being automatically discredited and regarded with suspicion.\n[[File:Pic.jpg|thumb|Pic had unknowingly found Yoda's lightsaber while kidnapping Qu Rahn.]]\nIn [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]], when [[Picaroon C. Boodle|Pic]] and [[Gorc]] were sent to kidnap [[Qu Rahn/Legends|Qu Rahn]], Pic noticed an old silver-hilt lightsaber, which, although only Rahn knew at the time, had once belonged to Grand Master Yoda. Pic placed weapon on his belt and later used it to fight Kyle Katarn.<ref name=\"DF2\">''[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent]]''</ref> Pic's body was left by Katarn on the ''Sulon Star'' along with Gorc's; Kyle did not realize at the time that the tiny [[darksider]] carried a weapon which had once belonged to Master Yoda. Later, after realizing the importance of the saber, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] sent a group of Jedi to retrieve the lightsaber, though it was unknown if they succeeded; the weapon and Pic's body could have stayed intact on the ship, or someone else might have taken it.<ref name=\"WOTC5\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050609a|text=The Dark Forces Saga, Part 5|int=The Dark Forces Saga}}</ref>\n\nAfter his death at the age of 900, Yoda retained his individuality in the Force. As a so-called Force ghost, he would look down on Leia and the Solo twins when they were born. His teachings would become the basis for what Luke taught his [[New Jedi Order]]. Since Yoda's teachings to Luke were rushed, most teachings of the Jedi Order were lost until the New Jedi Order began to find ancient holocrons, or, in some cases, libraries like the one on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]].\n\nYoda's ghost manifested on Coruscant for the birth of Jacen and Jaina.<ref name=\"The Last Command 1\">[[The Last Command 1|''The Last Command'' 1]]</ref>\n\nYoda's power and wisdom impressed Luke throughout his life.

Yoda was the best equipped to guide the Jedi order. To his students, the elfin luminary Yoda could appear as either very strict or like a grandfatherly figure, testing them to mental and physical extremes one moment and showing warmth the next. Students often strongly disagreed with him at first, but gradually came to understand his attitudes. He believed strongly in the need to heed the insights of the Unifying Force,<ref name=\"Star Wars Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook\">''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook]]''</ref> though he rejected the theory<ref name=\"The New Jedi Order: Traitor\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Traitor]]''</ref> the Force was essentially \"grey.\"<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith novelization\" />\n\nAmong his colleagues on the Jedi High Council, he was known to have a penchant for mischief and practical jokes. To all of the young Jedi, he was the humble Yoda, who offered enlightened leadership and epitomized the ideals of the Jedi Order; a grand master of that august body, he was widely known as a sage instructor.\n\nAlthough Yoda was a strict and firm leader, he deeply cared for the Jedi Order and the light side. The Jedi Master had the deepest commitment to the Force and the teachings thereof.<ref name=\"Star Wars Sourcebook\" /> Yoda respected Wookiees.<ref name=\"E3RotS3\">[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith 3|''Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith'' 3]]</ref> He was willing to sacrifice a chance to win and neutralize Dooku by saving Anakin and Kenobi when Dooku unleashed an attack that would have killed them. Yoda also greatly grieved Anakin Skywalker's fall and Order 66 killing almost all Jedi, to the point of falling to his knees. He was also willing to acknowledge whenever he was proven wrong, as shown by how he humbly apologized to Jinn&mdash;when the latter proved his unique wisdom was beneficial, as he had acquired the ability to retain identity&mdash;for having doubted him and acknowledged that he was a great Jedi.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith 4\">[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith 4|''Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith'' 4]]</ref>\n\nDespite a body of evidence to the contrary, which included famous names such as [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], [[Oss Wilum]], and [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], Yoda was largely a traditionalist in his belief that a Jedi who was seduced by the dark side of the Force would be forever condemned to walk in darkness. During the Clone Wars, however, he originally believed that no Jedi was beyond redemption and forgiveness. Even after Count Dooku betrayed the Republic and the Jedi by committing numerous atrocities as the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, Yoda once tried to persuade his former student to let go of the dark side and return to the ways of the Jedi, and very nearly succeeded in redeeming Dooku. Even as Quinlan Vos slipped further into the dark side's embrace, Yoda had faith that the disturbed young Jedi Master would find his way back to the light side of the Force; unlike Dooku, Vos vindicated Yoda's belief in redemption.\n\nHowever, Yoda's failure to redeem Dooku, as well as his inability to prevent the rise of the Galactic Empire, left the Grand Master more jaded than ever. In addition to the fall of the Republic, the Jedi Order was pushed to the brink of extinction by the fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whose fall to the dark side turned him into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Before his death, he warned Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, that \"when a person falls to the dark side, their destiny would forever be dominated by darkness.\"\n\nYoda spoke an unusual version of [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]]. He tended to place verbs (especially auxiliaries) after the object and subject (an object-subject-verb format). An example of Yoda's speech pattern: \"When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not.\"({{Audio|900YearsOld-ROTJ.ogg|Listen}}) Most agreed that this pattern of speech was convoluted, and while it seems as though others of his species (e.g. Yaddle) had the same penchant for rearranging sentences, not all of them did (e.g. [[Vandar Tokare]]). As suggested by [[Ben Skywalker]], he purposefully chose to speak like this so that people would have to listen attentively to what he said.<ref name=\"Backlash\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Yodascrest.svg|thumb|left|100px|[[Yoda's crest]]]]\nYoda walked with the aid of a cane later in life, although he was capable of throwing it aside and moving nimbly while using the Force.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" /> One of his canes was a gift from the Wookiees. His rare [[Gimer bush|gimer]] cane contained nutrients that could sustain him were he to chew on it. He also used a [[Repulsorlift chair/Legends|hoverchair]] for moving around the Temple quickly and more efficiently.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nAnother item unique to Master Yoda was a [[Blissl/Legends|blissl]], an instrument similar to a pan flute, which he wore around his neck while on Dagobah. During the Clone Wars, he would often make use of a kybuck given to him by a [[Woolwarricca]] princess from Kashyyyk as a gift.<ref name=\"kybuckdatabank\">{{DB|creature|kybuck|kybuck}}</ref>\nYoda also had a unique [[Yoda's crest|crest]] that adorned his [[Yoda's quarters/Legends|quarters]].\n\nYoda's origins were secretive and he never revealed his homeworld to anyone.<ref name=\"ultimateillustrated\">''[[Star Wars: Attack of the Clones: The Ultimate Illustrated Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Help you I can.

Wars not make one great.|Yoda and Luke Skywalker, meeting on Dagobah|<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\" />}}\nConsidered by many to be the greatest Jedi Master of the era, Yoda was one of the most skilled lightsaber duelists and users of the Force in the history of the galaxy. Yoda's powers awestruck even the Dark Jedi Beldorion, who grouped him among three elite Jedi Masters, along with Thon and Nomi Sunrider, who had lived several millennia earlier than him. Beldorion considered the trio to be truly great as they were prodigiously talented in the Force, specifically in the directing of pure light-side energies.<ref name=\"Planet of Twilight\" /> Of all the Force users in the galaxy, only Darth Sidious, perhaps the most powerful Sith Lord of all time, rivaled Yoda's mastery of the Force and strength with a lightsaber.\n\n===Lightsaber training===\n[[File:Air_yoda.jpg|thumb|200px|Yoda was extremely skilled with the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].]]\nIn addition to his immense connection to the Force, Yoda was amazingly skilled in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]], one of the greatest duelists in history, and was widely acknowledged as being perhaps the greatest Jedi duelist and [[Swordmaster]] of his time despite being trained as a [[Jedi Consular]]. He was known to be the only Jedi who could best both Mace Windu and [[Count of Serenno/Legends|Count]] Dooku. Although he did not often participate in direct combat, Yoda's impeccable swordsmanship remained as sharp as ever. In his duel with Dooku, who had became Darth Tyranus and improved his skill even further, Yoda held the upper hand throughout the majority of the fight and would have defeated him had Tyranus not fled. Testament to his unnatural experience in dueling was that Dooku under his tutelage became a swordsman of rare skill and elegance, quickly rising to surpass most Jedi apart from Windu and Yoda himself. Nearly inconceivable was the last fight the small Jedi had against the leader of the CIS, which resulted in Dooku actually landing a hit (though minor) on the master of Ataru, a feat thought basically impossible to accomplish. Another testament to Yoda's immense dueling skill was that not only was he able to fight on equal footing with Darth Sidious, but he was also even able to defeat and disarm the Dark Lord, a feat that only Luke Skywalker (while empowered by the might and meditation of his family) and Mace Windu were ever able to replicate.<ref name=\"ROTS junior novel\" /> In fact, Sidious was confused and confounded by Yoda's speed and skill.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Jedi Battles\">''[[Star Wars: Jedi Battles]]''</ref> He was able to disarm Darth Sidious, who only preserved his life by throwing a huge blast of lightning Yoda had to cease his deathstrike to block with the Force,<ref name=\"ROTS junior novel\" /> and then by shooting Yoda's saber from his hand when the Grandmaster was a moment too slow while maneuvering around the Senate chamber.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" /> Overall, Yoda's mastery of lightsaber combat marked him as the greatest duelist of his time. Sidious himself, after having dueled Yoda, stated his belief that the [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] would have \"destroyed\" Darth Vader if the young Sith had faced ''him'' rather than Kenobi on Mustafar.<ref name=\"Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader\">''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]''</ref>\n\nYoda received intensive training in the use of all the seven forms of lightsaber combat and had achieved full mastery and knowledge of them all and all of their stances and techniques. Known to be the best lightsaber instructor in the Temple, his complete mastery of each form was such that he was able to decide which one fitted his student the most and instruct them how to use their specialized form effectively. His most preferred style was [[Form IV/Legends|Form IV]], which he particularly specialized at, as it allowed him to compensate for his limited reach and stature. Known to be the Order's greatest master of Ataru, his technique was said to consist of the pure basics of Ataru taken to their highest possible levels.<ref name=\"Fightsaber: Jedi Lightsaber Combat\">{{InsiderCite|62|Fightsaber: Jedi Lightsaber Combat}}</ref> Despite his advanced age and short stature, Yoda remained an exceptionally formidable duelist, displaying amazing speed and dexterity, leaping through the air and twirling as he battered at an opponent's defenses.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\" /> Much of his lightsaber combat style relied on jumps and acrobatics, augmented by his mastery of [[Force valor]]. Despite the fact that Yoda's primary combat specialization was Ataru, his skill in the form was such that he was capable of effectively overcoming it's weaknesses with ease and demonstrated an extreme level of skill with regard to deflecting blaster bolts and could easily handle many opponents at once, evidenced by his easy victory over many clone troopers when he returned to the Jedi Temple during Order 66.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" /> In addition, Yoda at times applied his mastery of the other forms into his dueling style. He was known for having proficiently applied elements of Shii-Cho bladework and his outstanding deflection ability implied a superb level of skill in either Shien or Soresu.\n\nHowever, in his later years, Yoda lost a great deal of his mobility, demonstrating a pronounced limp and depending on a cane to aid him in his everyday movements. This loss of mobility was due to the fact that, in his old age, Yoda suffered from debilitating arthritis.<ref name=\"Fightsaber: Jedi Lightsaber Combat\" /> When possible, Yoda preferred to use a hoverchair rather than walk at all.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" /> His mastery of Force valor allowed him to overcome these physical infirmities, but due to the extremely taxing nature of the ability, he was only able to utilize it for a short time before tiring.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith novelization\" /> Even when he trained Luke Skywalker, however, Yoda retained enough skill to effortlessly defeating his pupil with only a stick, in spite of Skywalker being armed with a lightsaber and employing a [[Telekinesis/Legends|saber throw]] against him--and only lost when he allowed Skywalker to seize his stick.<ref name=\"Treasure\" />\n\nMaster Yoda carried a green-bladed [[Shoto lightsaber/Legends|shoto]], which, unlike most other lightsabers, possessed an ignition button that also acted as a clip. Yoda was one of the few Force-users, Jedi and Sith alike, who kept his trademark homespun<ref name=\"SWCE\">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia]]''</ref> robe on during combat, possibly because it was small enough not to hinder his movements.\n\nYoda was able to cave his way through a host of [[Spelunker probe droid/Legends|Spelunker probe droids]], often moving faster than they could react or fire.<ref name=\"CW15\">{{CW|15}}</ref>\n\nYoda fought his way to safety through a squad of clones during [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]].<ref name=\"E3RotS3\" />\n\n===Force powers===\n[[File:Yodaholdup.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Yoda demonstrates his ability to telekinetically move objects.]]\nYoda, as befitting a centuries-old Jedi Grand Master, was extraordinarily powerful and skilled in the Force, one of the most powerful Force users in history&mdash;rivaling Darth Sidious&mdash;and was the greatest and strongest master of the Force among the Jedi of his time, surpassing even the potentially more powerful Anakin Skywalker, due to having far more experience in using it. Luke Skywalker considered Yoda's powers to be far beyond what Darth Vader was capable of, and felt Yoda was likewise much more powerful than he was in 9 ABY.<ref name=\"HeirtotheEmpire\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> His power in the Force was described as being \"as light as the stars.\" His midi-chlorian count was also known to be the second highest in the history of the Jedi, surpassed only by the Chosen One Anakin Skywalker. His strength and mastery of the Force was great enough that he could easily defend himself against and dominate other powerful masters of the Force, as shown when he casually repelled all of Dooku's Force assaults despite the increase in power and skill Dooku had acquired from turning to the dark side. Yoda was so powerful and skilled in Force combat that he could effortlessly overpower highly skilled and armed adversaries using nothing but the Force, as evidenced with Asaji Ventress. Indeed, Yoda was the only one to have ever managed to single-handedly go up against Darth Sidious in Force combat and matched the Dark Lord to a draw, although he proved incapable of defeating him as they were evenly matched. His power and skill in the Force remained tremendous even as he continued to age and lost his former great mobility. Even the Dark Lords of the Sith Darth Tyranus and Darth Sidious acknowledged his Force power and mastery, with Darth Tyranus holding his former master's strength in the Force in high enough regard that he believed that should Yoda fall to the dark side, he would be so powerful that not even Sidious would be able to stand against him.<ref name=\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\" /> According to Luke, Yoda's powers far surpassed his own and Darth Vader's.<ref name=\"HeirtotheEmpire\" />\n\nMaster Yoda was extremely skilled in the use of mind-related powers. He could cast [[Mind trick/Legends|mind tricks]] that were easily strong enough to effectively manipulate strong-willed individuals, such as [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Gregar Typho/Legends|Typho]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" /> and could easily delve deep into the minds of others to decipher their thoughts with great precision. Yoda's [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathic]] capabilities also allowed him to manipulate the memories of his targets.\n\nYoda was also extraordinarily skilled in [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]]. He demonstrated on one occasion the ability to easily telekinetically lift and carry an [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]], and during the Battle of Coruscant, he caused a pair of [[C-9979 landing craft/Legends|C-9979 landing craft]] to collide with each other on two separate occasions.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" /> In their duel on Geonosis, Yoda easily deflected every telekinetic assault from Darth Tyranus, who was a former Temple instructor of telekinesis. Yoda was able to catch Darth Sidious off guard with a Force-push that blasted Sidious away from him and later managed to stop a Senate Hoverpod that Sidious hurled at him from above, which he then proceeded to use the Force to throw back at him, an all the more impressive feat due to the fact that the pod was thrown upwards against gravity. He even could effortlessly toy with the very powerful Asajj Ventress, who was known to have defeated Kit Fisto and could hold her own against the likes of Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker, using only telekinesis: he was able to easily send her flying, stop her strike in midair, and even go as far as to casually disarm her of her lightsabers with a simple gesture.<ref name=\"Ambush\" /> A master practitioner of the Force Push and [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Wave|Force Wave]] powers, Yoda used these abilities in conjunction with Mace Windu to blast away dozens of battle droids simultaneously during the Battle of Coruscant and also to raise an expansive force of Separatist battle droids into the air, ensuring that they would collide into the incoming airborne Separatist attack ships, which eliminated the two attack forces in one seamless stroke.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" /> Master Yoda was also adept at the saber throw, as demonstrated in his return to the Jedi Temple during the Great Jedi Purge.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\nYoda also displayed an astounding level of mastery in the use of the defensive power of [[Tutaminis]], using it during his duel with Darth Tyranus to effortlessly absorb and redirect the Sith Lord's Force lightning with no effort. Despite being nearly overwhelmed by its power, Yoda was ultimately able to absorb Sidious's lightning, eventually managing to coalesce the energy of the Dark Lord's Force lightning into a blue orb between the two of them, which slowly redirected the lightning back onto an astounded Sidious and caused him to slowly reel backwards with the strength of Yoda's counterattack before the combination of both of their Force powers blasted the two of them apart. Yoda also was able to use [[Force valor|Force Valor]] to improve his physical attributes with the Force, and even after his exile was so strong in the Force that he was able to resist old age long enough to train Luke.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" /><ref name=\"The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook\">''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]''</ref> Yoda could, with great effort, use the Force to stifle and quash the efforts of his enemies to draw on the Force.<ref name=\"Star Wars Miniatures\">[[Revenge of the Sith (Star Wars Miniatures)|''Revenge of the Sith'' {{C|Star Wars Miniatures}}]]</ref> However, despite his great power and skill as a warrior, Yoda was known to strongly dislike combat in general, and was even a bit disdainful of the idea that \"greatness\" could be achieved through martial prowess.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\n[[File:Yodasforcedeflection.png|thumb|right|250px|Yoda could [[Tutaminis|absorb]] overpowering [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] with his bare hands.]]\nMaster Yoda was able to [[Force vision/Legends|foresee]] events with a great clarity, rivaling even that of Darth Sidious. In addition, Yoda had extremely strong [[Force sense/Legends|Force senses]], as he was able to quickly sense the deaths of almost all members of the Jedi Order and identify each one, while also sensing that Anakin Skywalker had turned to the dark side even all the way from Kashyyyk. Due to his training with Qui-Gon Jinn, Yoda acquired the power to retain his identity after becoming one with the Force.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\" /> He even was able to foresee that Luke would need to know about Mortis, an eventuality that came to pass more than forty years after the Jedi did.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" /> He was also able to ponder matters of the dark and light sides of the Force with unparalleled clarity that surpassed all other Jedi of his time, even Mace Windu. He was the most skilled user of [[Force empathy]] among the Jedi, exceeding even the renowned empathic abilities of Depa Billaba.<ref name=\"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook\">''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''</ref> He could sense intense feelings coming from others even from other planets, as he was able to sense the immense pain Anakin felt from the death of his mother, as well as hear the voice of Jinn's spirit, while the latter was on Tatooine even though Yoda was on Coruscant and meditating. He also easily sensed the tension between Kenobi and Anakin when they pursued Dooku and was able to identify the cause as Padm\u00e9's fall from an LAAT gunship.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" /> Yoda [[Farsight/Legends|could see things far off]], and had watched Luke through the Force for a long time.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\" /> Supposedly, he had a Force technique to guide humankind to be more moral.<ref name=\"Dark Empire 1\">[[Dark Empire 1|''Dark Empire'' 1]]</ref> Yoda could [[Short-term memory enhancement|enhance his memory]] and taught this power to Luke.<ref name=\":0\" /> He could also sometimes look through the eyes of other Jedi.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\" /> Yoda could [[Force Stasis/Legends|stun]] his foes, [[Alter Environment|change the environment]] to try to block their attacks, [[Force suppression|quash other's Force powers]] and [[Enhance Force Sensitivity|make those not sensitive to the Force able to use it to a limited extent]],<ref name=\"CotF\">{{SWMiniCite|set=Champions of the Force|pack=Yoda of Dagobah}}</ref> such as when his healing of Jorj Car'das made the man able to use the Force to a limited extent.<ref name=\"VotF\" />\n\nYoda was also quite proficient in the valued Force technique [[Battle meditation/Legends|Battle Meditation]], having even been able to determine the outcome of battles by lifting the morale of thousands of companions while simultaneously dampening the spirits of thousands of his opponents, wielding armies with the same ease as sabers.<ref name=\"The Hidden Enemy\" /> Yoda could enter a [[Serenity (trance)|trance state]], then when he emerged his ability to use the Force briefly was more focused.<ref name=\"Ambush\" /> Moreover was able to summon the force power of [[Electric Judgment|Emerald Lightning]], such as when he fought Darth Sidious,<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Who Are the Jedi?\">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Who Are the Jedi?|Star Wars The Clone Wars: Who are the Jedi?]]''</ref><ref name=\"VotF\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith novelization\" /> and when he seeded it into a dark mirror of himself.<ref name=\"TCW:Destiny\" /> In addition, Yoda could use [[Force harmony]] to defend himself from Dark powers and even shatter powers already in effect\u2014this ability became more effective if Yoda was able to join his power with that of other Jedi.<ref name=\"The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook\" /> Yoda was believed by Luke to have, in 3 ABY, [[Ionize|used the Force to disable the sensors]] of the young Jedi's ship, then used the Force to guide the craft to where it needed to be.<ref name=\"HeirtotheEmpire\" /> He was also capable of using it to inspire great amounts of hope while simultaneously eliminating feelings of doubt and despair from the spirit of others with a single touch, as he did to [[Inspire|saturate]] Palleus Chuff with feelings of hope and potential mission success while also completely dispersing his feelings of doubt and despair. Yoda was very proficient in the use of the Force to preserve life, having learned the use of many powers to [[Force healing/Legends|heal]] himself and others,<ref name=\"The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook\" /> and even keeping himself alive though sheer willpower until he trained Luke Skywalker, though just before he allowed himself to pass into the Force he admitted he was at the end of his strength due to the great power required for such a feat.<ref name=\"ROTJn\" /> Upon his death, Yoda's body vanished as he became a [[Force ghost/Legends|Force ghost]].<ref name=\"ROTJn\" />\n\nHowever, despite his advanced skill and power in the Force, he was only able to lift five of the seven [[Muntuur stones]] while in meditation once he passed his seven hundredth year.<ref name=\"The Jedi Path\" /> Moreover, Yoda was aware of several [[Sith sorcery/Legends|Sith spells]]\u2014though he did not use them, and understood the Dark Side powers to [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Wound|kill with a touch]] or take [[Mind trick/Legends#Mind control|total control over a victim]], though again he is not known to actually used these Dark Side powers.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Who Are the Jedi?\" /><ref name=\"The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook\" /> Yoda contemplated [[Memory rub/Legends|using the dark side to remove all memory of himself]] from a man, but ultimately decided that to do so would be wrong, and instead did what he felt the Force was guiding him to do and spared the historian.<ref name=\"Star Wars Sourcebook\" />\n\n<br />\n\n===Other abilities===\n[[File:Yoda_TCGBtS.png|thumb|left|220px|Yoda in his hut on Dagobah]]\nUnlike most other Jedi of his era, Master Yoda knew how to create Jedi holocrons. The diminutive Jedi Master created [[Yoda's holocron|at least one holocron]], through which he discussed various aspects of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]]. This particular holocron was rescued by [[Jax Pavan]] during Vader's attack on the Jedi Temple.\n\nYoda was known for being the wisest and smartest Jedi of his time. He was an exceptional strategist, being a great contributor to the highest level of Jedi strategy, and was also an exceptional diplomat comparable with the likes of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu. As such, many of the sage's missions during the Clone Wars were diplomatic in nature, and he prevented many battles from occurring, though some, as in the case of his missions to Vjun and Rugosa, ultimately descended into battle.<ref name=\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\" /><ref name=\"Ambush\" /> Yoda later demonstrated his strategical aptitude by choosing Dagobah as his place of exile, using the strong dark-side presence around the cave representing the dark side to block the senses of Sidious and Vader.<ref name=\"HeirtotheEmpire\" /> Yoda also came up with a plan to evade CIS fire when his ship was ambushed, ordering all escape pods to be launched so the droids would not know which one he was in.<ref name=\"Ambush\" /> Despite at times offering help to others, he was able to avoid any confrontation with the Empire during his exile.\n\nYoda was a very capable leader, as Mace Windu passed on the mantle of the Master of the Order to him, and he also at times led many attacks during the Clone Wars to victory. He also had enough strength to carry a box with a gigantic [[Chaingun/Legends|chaingun]], this weapon he used to destroy a droid army in order to save a [[Unidentified planet (Yoda's charge)|planet]].<ref name=\"A Stranger in Town\">{{CWACite|3|A Stranger in Town}}</ref> He was confidant that he could destroy the droid attack on the Wookiees.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith 2\">[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith 2|''Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith'' 2]]</ref> Sometime during his exile, he was able to craft a new lightsaber.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Card Game\">''[[Star Wars: The Card Game]]''</ref>\n\nAlthough Yoda usually had his soldiers handle the piloting, when required to personally pilot a ship, he proved surprisingly capable, as evidenced when he was forced to travel alone to Dagobah: he single-handedly flew a starfighter without fail, avoiding any damage while piloting it. He could even enhance his piloting skills using the Force, allowing him to safely reach the planet where the Force Priestesses were when Artoo and the instruments on the ship malfunctioned while in a small, glowing, golden nebula.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" /><ref name=\"TCW:Destiny\" /><ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" />\n\nYoda was perceptive with his physical senses as well as the Force, as shown when he was able to catch Luke Skywalker cheating during exercises.<ref name=\"Treasure\" /> By his own admission, food Yoda prepared often tasted foul.<ref name=\"Treasure\" /> However, Skywalker felt the old master's stews tasted good.<ref name=\"HeirtotheEmpire\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Yodaold2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original Yoda puppet from [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|Episode I]].]]\n[[File:TPMCGYoda.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A CG version of Yoda from Episode I was created as a test during the animation process for [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Episode III]].]]\nYoda was voiced by Muppeteer [[Frank Oz]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films. In the [[original trilogy]] and [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']], he was realized as a [[Wikipedia:Puppet|puppet]] (controlled by Oz). Yoda's appearance was originally designed by British makeup artist [[Stuart Freeborn]], who based Yoda's face partly on his own and partly on [[Wikipedia:Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]]. In ''The Phantom Menace'' the actor [[Warwick Davis]] played Yoda for scenes where the character was required to walk. Rendered with computer animation in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Attack of the Clones'']] and [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']], Yoda appeared in ways not previously possible, including his participation in elaborate fight scenes. However, Yoda's first appearance as a completely CG-rendered image was in ''The Phantom Menace'', at the close of the film where he talks with Obi-Wan about his and Anakin's futures.\n\nFor the radio dramatizations of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', he was voiced by veteran character actor [[John Lithgow]]. [[Tom Kane]] provided Yoda's voice for both the [[Star Wars: Clone Wars|''Clone Wars'']] animated series and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|''The Clone Wars'']] 3D series, as well as many video-game incarnations: ''[[Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Super Bombad Racing]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter]]'', [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (video game)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']], ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'' and [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (video game)|''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'']].\n\nAlong with a few substitute voice actors in the original trilogy, but from the second one onwards, Yoda is dubbed in Japanese by the late [[Wikipedia:Ichir\u014d Nagai|Ichir\u014d Nagai]]. By this proxy along with his and Darth Vader's appearance in [[Soulcalibur IV]], Nagai also provided Yoda's voice in the Japanese version of the game.\n\nThe depiction of the number of Yoda's toes is inconsistent between different films, alternately numbering three, four and five toes. [[Leland Chee]], keeper of the [[Holocron continuity database]], has stated that Yoda canonically has four toes&mdash;three in the front and one in the back.<ref name=\"Insider122AskLobot\">{{InsiderCite|122|Ask Lobot}}</ref> For more, see the article on [[Yoda's species/Legends#Number of toes|Yoda's species]].\n[[File:YodaConceptArt.png|thumb|175px|Very early concept art of Yoda]]\nYoda's popularity is such that the comedy musician [[Wikipedia:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic|\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] parodied the song \"[[Wikipedia:Lola (song)|Lola]]\" with a version called \"[[Wikipedia:Yoda (song)|Yoda]],\" included on the album ''[[Wikipedia:Dare to Be Stupid|Dare to Be Stupid]]'' (1985). More recently, [[Wikipedia:Luke Ski|the Great Luke Ski]] parodied the song [[Wikipedia:YMCA (song)|\"YMCA\"]] by [[Wikipedia:Village People|the Village People]] with a version called \"Y.O.D.A.\" included on the albums ''Fanboys 'n Da Hood'' (1996) and ''Carpe Dementia'' (1999).\n\nProducer/director [[Wikipedia:Mel Brooks|Mel Brooks]] lampooned Yoda in his 1987 movie ''[[W:c:spaceballs:Spaceballs|Spaceballs]]''. Brooks portrayed a diminutive character named [[W:c:spaceballs:Yogurt|Yogurt]], who specialized in manipulating a magical energy known as the [[W:c:spaceballs:The Schwartz|Schwartz]].\n[[W:c:muppet:Yoda Muppet|Yoda]] also made a cameo in ''[[Wikipedia:It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie|It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie]]'', voiced by [[W:c:Muppet:Eric Jacobson|Eric Jacobson]]. Jacobson took over many of Frank Oz's Muppet roles.\n\nYoda also appears in a [[Wikipedia:Hip hop|hip-hop]] Yoda music video that can be accessed via the ''Revenge of the Sith'' DVD when you go to the Options menu, highlight the [[THX]] logo, press 11, wait for the pause, press 3, wait for the pause, and finally press 8.\n\nTo get the animation team back in shape for their work on Episode III, Rob Coleman and his team replaced the footage of the Episode I Yoda puppet with their Episode III digital model as a test to see how far they could push his usual performance boundaries. This footage was released on the DVD, where it can be seen as part of \"The Chosen One\" featurette on Disc 2 of ''Revenge of the Sith''. The footage has since appeared in the Blu-ray release of ''The Phantom Menace'', replacing the puppet Yoda.\n\nOriginal concept art showed Yoda as blue instead of the green that he ended up being, and he is depicted as blue in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' novelization (published before the film of ''The Empire Strikes Back'') . In Marvel's [[Star Wars (1977) 42|''Star Wars'' (1977) 42]], Yoda also seems to be tinier than in his normal appearance.\n\n[[File:YodaScroll.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Artwork depicting Yoda keeping busy in his hut was used on children's lunchboxes]]\nIn some foreign dubs of the films, Yoda's bizarre manner of speaking has not been translated.\n\nIn ''[[Before the Storm]]'', Luke Skywalker tells [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] that when he first met Yoda, he was a hermit on Dagobah for a hundred years or more. The [[prequel trilogy]]'s storyline, created several years later, shows that Yoda was on Dagobah for no more than 22 years when Luke first met him.\n\n''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' and ''[[Vision of the Future]]'' describe how Yoda followed a Dark Jedi from [[Bpfassh]] to Dagobah and killed him on the planet. After the [[Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (novelization)|''Revenge of the Sith'' novelization]] (which hints that Yoda had never been on Dagobah before his exile) was published, it has been suggested the battle occurred shortly after the exile.<ref name=\"holocron\" /> In [[Star Wars Insider 98|''Star Wars Insider'' 98]] [[Leland Chee]] wrote that the location of the battle is no longer considered part of continuity, but that it is possible that a mortally wounded Dark Jedi died on the planet after having fought Yoda elsewhere. However, this has not been confirmed.\n\nYoda received an updated character model to look more accurate to his ''Revenge of the Sith'' appearance for [[The Clone Wars: Season Five]].\n\nIn the ride ''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]'', Yoda was one of the characters helping the [[StarSpeeder 1000]] pilot safely deliver a Rebel spy to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. However, as he was not known to have interacted with the Rebel Alliance during this time, it is unknown whether this is canon.\n\nIn November 2013, a deleted scene for ''Return of the Jedi'' was found on the laserdisc edition of the film. The scene, taking place on Yoda's deathbed and presumably occurring when Luke learns Vader was indeed his father, had him revealing that Obi-Wan Kenobi would have told Luke about his paternal relation to Vader had Yoda let him, making clear that Yoda was largely the reason Kenobi hid the truth from Luke.<ref name=\"Kenobi redeemed\">{{WebCite|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deleted-jedi-line-redeemed-obi-653550|text=The Deleted 'Jedi' Line That Redeemed Obi-Wan Kenobi|author=McMillan, Graeme|date=2013-11-05|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|The Hollywood Reporter]]|archivedate=20210213232210}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yodasign.png|thumb|150px|Yoda's signature in ''The Jedi Path'']]\nYoda's signature in [[The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force (real-life book)|''The Jedi Path'']] differs<ref name=\"The Jedi Path\" /> from that of the 1980 Yoda postcard made by Frank Oz.<ref name=\"Yoda postcard\">{{Lucasfilm|url=news/history-in-objects-a-postcard-from-yoda|text=History in Objects: A Postcard from Yoda}}</ref>\n\n===Non-canon appearances===\n{{Quote|Sick and weak I have become, Elderly and tir'd, And yet, I ask thee: When nine hundred years thou hast, Shalt thou look better?|Yoda to Luke Skywalker|<ref name=\"Jedi Doth Return\">''[[William Shakespeare's The Jedi Doth Return: Star Wars Part the Sixth]]''</ref>}}\n\n[[File:YodaAsImaginedByRoanNovachez-ReturnOfThePadawan.jpg|thumb|250px|A drawing by Roan Novachez of how he imagined Yoda would look]]\nOfficial non-canon ''Star Wars'' works generally still portrayed Yoda as a wise and skilled Jedi Master, but often played up his more humorous traits.\n\nIn [[Jeffrey Brown]]'s [[Jedi Academy (novel)|''Jedi Academy'']] books, Yoda is a top instructor at the [[Jedi academy]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], but not the academy's principal. Approximately 700 years old, he provides students with important training on the deeper aspects of the Force, but sometimes says things that are humorous or downright strange. He almost always talks backwards and laughs a lot. [[Roan Novachez]], a student recruited to the academy at a relatively late age, was surprised by Yoda's appearance and nature and initially suspected that Yoda was teaching instead of being a full-time Jedi Knight because he was going kind of senile. Later in the series, Yoda became the personal Jedi Master to the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Cyrus (Jedi Academy)|Cyrus]].\n\nIn ''[[William Shakespeare's The Empire Striketh Back: Star Wars Part the Fifth]]'' and ''[[William Shakespeare's The Jedi Doth Return: Star Wars Part the Sixth]]'', Yoda is the only character to speak entirely in haiku.\n\n''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles]]'' features Yoda and focuses on events seen in the prequel era.\n\n===Clone Wars: Infinities: What if the Father never rescued Anakin from the dark side?===\nAfter Anakin fell under the influence of the [[Son/Legends|Son]] from [[Mortis]], they both returned to the regular plane of the universe. Both Yoda and Palpatine sensed their arrival upon Coruscant. Because of this both Yoda and Palpatine called a temporary truce to stop Anakin, but Anakin proved too powerful for either of them and defeated them with relative ease. He then became even more powerful in the process, and proceeded to create a Force hurricane in the Senate building.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars Magazine 7\">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars

He was known for his legendary wisdom, mastery of the Force and skills in lightsaber combat. Yoda served as a member of the Jedi High Council in the last centuries of the Galactic Republic and as Grand Master oversaw the Jedi Order before, during, and after the devastating Clone Wars. Following the First Battle of Geonosis, Yoda held the title of Master of the Order in addition to that of Grand Master. In his centuries of service to the galaxy and the Force, Grand Master Yoda had a hand in the training of nearly all the Jedi in the Order, including such luminaries as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Oppo Rancisis, all of whom would come to serve on the Jedi Council along with him.\nStanding about 66 cm tall, Yoda was a male member of a mysterious species, details of which he did not reveal. Yoda served as a member of the Jedi Order for centuries, eventually gaining a seat on the Jedi High Council, before reigning as the Grand Master of the Jedi. He had exceptional skills in lightsaber combat, having mastered all forms and stances of lightsaber combat, except the Vaapad subset of Form VII (he had mastered the original Form VII variant known as Juyo), but known for being particularly accomplished in Form IV, often employing the acrobatic techniques of the form. Many considered him a swordmaster and the greatest duelist in the Jedi Order, even surpassing Mace Windu and Count Dooku.\nThough arguably the Orders greatest master of the Force and most skilled warrior, Yoda believed most firmly in the importance of instructing younger generations and never missed an opportunity to ensure his students learn from their experiences. At heart, the diminutive Jedi Master was a teacher; indeed, he instructed nearly all the Jedi in the order, to some extent, during his reign as Grand Master.Yoda: Dark Rendezvous'\nThough Yoda was, arguably, the most highly Force-attuned member of the Order, he was not flawless. It was partially due to his failure to recognize that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was actually responsible for the outbreak of the Clone Wars, and was in fact the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, or to destroy him in battle, that the Republic was overthrown and the Jedi Order decimated. The Grand Master was among the few Jedi to survive Darth Sidious' Great Jedi Purge, after the beginning of which, he went into exile on the swamp planet of Dagobah.\nLater, before dying and becoming one with the Force in 4 ABY, the exiled Jedi Master was responsible for the instruction of Luke Skywalker, who would use Yodas training as a basis for the creation of a New Jedi Order, after defeating the Sith. Following his death, Master Yoda retained his identity within the Force and was revered as amongst the most legendary Jedi Masters of all time by Skywalkers reconstituted Order.\n\n\u2022 Biography\n\n\u2022 Early life\n\nYoda\nGormo]]\nVery little is known about Yodas early life. He was from a remote planet, but which one remains a mystery.Star Wars: The Legendary Yoda' According to one legend, Yoda originally did not know that he was Force-sensitive at all. His path towards the Jedi began when he left his home planet with a Human friend, who also did not know he was Force-sensitive, on an old, barely space-worthy ship en route to the Core Worlds to seek employment. However, long before they could reach their destination, the ship was struck by a large asteroid, causing it to become severely disabled beyond their abilities to repair. They spent several days drifting dead in space during which time both their life support systems and rations came close to being exhausted, and there was still no response to their distress signal. It seemed like they would soon meet their deaths until their sensors picked up a star system not too far away. They had just enough power to make it there, and did so before crash landing on a strangeI swampy planet covered with a dense fog.\nThey spent a few days there before being found by a strange being: Hysalrian Jedi Master NKata Del Gormo, who revealed to them both that they were very much Force-sensitive. The Jedi Master invited Yoda to become his apprentice, also known as a Padawan. Master Gormo took them to his home, where he trained them in the ways of the Force and, not long after their training was complete, a Galactic Republic starship picked up their distress signal and rescued the two friends, who were now Jedi themselves. Departing the world, Yoda went to Coruscant, where he continued his training at the Jedi Temple as a Jedi Initiate. As time passed, he proved to be a skilled Jedi, and he studied under the Jedi Master Fae Coven.The Jedi Path Eventually, Yoda passed The Gathering and was assisted by the architect droid Huyang in the construction of his first lightsaber.A Necessary Bond\n\n\u2022 Jedi Master\n\nYoda\nWhen Yoda had completed his Padawan training, he became a Jedi Knight, meaning he could go on important missions. By the age of 96, he had become a Jedi Master. Later, he was elected to join the Jedi High Council. By 800 BBY, Yoda had begun the training of his first student, who would be one of the many Padawans Yoda would train over the long centuries of his life.\nLater, Yoda became one of the Jedi Masters who led the mobile academy aboard the starship Chu'unthor, which was constructed circa 500 BBY. After crash-landing on the planet of Dathomir at around 230 BBY, Yoda and the other Jedi fought with the famed Witches of Dathomir. Coming to a stalemate, he agreed to leave the ships data tapes. Although he left no means of reading the tapes, they were bestowed to Rell of the Singing Mountain Clan for safekeeping until such a time, Yoda foresaw, when a Jedi would come to save the planet from darkness and the information could safely be shared with the Witches. This did not happen until around 8 ABY, when Yodas final student, Luke Skywalker, found his way to Dathomir, fulfilling his Masters prophecy.The Courtship of Princess Leia'\nYoda once traveled to Kushibah in search of a new Padawan. There among the diminutive Kushiban, the Jedi Master discovered young Ikrit, who proved strong in the Force, and took him to be trained as a Jedi. As a Jedi Knight, Ikrit once lost control during a petty disagreement and almost murdered a friend with his lightsaber, with Yoda risking his own life to stop him. As a result, Ikrit forsook the use of lightsabers for years afterward.Junior Jedi Knights: Vaders Fortress\nBy around 400 BBY, when Beldorion left the Jedi Order, Yoda could be considered one of the greatest Masters in Jedi history, comparable with Nomi Sunrider or Thon, both of whom had lived more than 3,500 years earlier. Planet of Twilight, p. 187.\nBy 200 BBY, Yoda, along with other Jedi Masters of that time, discovered that the shape of the Force had begun to flux, becoming murky and uncertain. Studying the perplexing mystery in silent meditation, the Jedi High Council, of which Yoda was now a senior member, was unanimous: the power of the dark side was growing. While the Council and the other Jedi believed this indicated the growing power of the Sith or other dark-siders, Yoda put forth the possibility that the darkening of the Force might suggest the imminent approach of the Chosen One, which prophecy said would bring balance to the Force. In opposition to this theory, several of the younger Jedi disputed Yoda's findings, and formed a breakaway sect&mdash;the Potentium. Their heresy was not welcomed by the Council, and Yoda led the campaign to expel them from the order in 130 BBY.\nAround one hundred and fifty years before the Clone Wars, Yoda traveled to Ord Cestus and saved the native XTing from disaster. They honored Yoda by building a giant statue of him, at least 70 meters tall, inside the XTing Hall of Heroes.The Hive At some point between 133 BBY and 69 BBY, Master Yoda attempted to see the future of Byrch Dyshkava, a Padawan who had mysteriously gone missing after a mission. Yoda failed to provide the Order with any useful information.\nIn 102 BBY an infant by the name of Dooku, heir to the title of Count on the planet of Serenno, was discovered by the Jedi and willingly given to the Order by his parents. When Dooku reached the appropriate age, he was taken as a Padawan by Council member Thame Cerulian. However, even though he studied under Cerulian, Yoda took a particular interest in the young Dooku and was frequently his adviser and confidant. The Jedi Master, however, was equally quick to point out Dookus flaws when necessary. Yoda assisted quite closely in Dookus lightsaber training as a Padawan, and building from this foundation, Dooku became an accomplished duelist with the weapon. In Dooku's later years, only Yoda and senior Council member Mace Windu were considered equal to his skill with a lightsaber. Later, Yoda also served as the lightsaber instructor of Cin Drallig, who would become the Battlemaster of the Jedi Temple.\n\n\u2022 Yinchorri uprising (33 BBY)\n\n\u2022 Early engagements\n\nIn 33 BBY, the Jedi Council received a transmission sent four standard days earlier informing them of an attack on Mayvitch 7 instigated by the Yinchorri. After news of this reached Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, he asked Mace Windu to send Jedi to negotiate with the Yinchorri. However, the aggressive Yinchorri murdered the two Jedi sent to negotiate and sent their mutilated bodies to Valorums Coruscant doorstep as a warning.Star Wars: Jedi Council: Acts of War'\nFollowing this, the Council created a Jedi strike team of twelve, including senior Councilor Mace Windu, to the Yinchorri system. Reports of the Jedis engagement with Yinchorri forces that reached Yoda and the Council proved confusing and contradictory, while the diminutive Jedi Master sensed danger coming toward him in the Force. Yodas danger sense proved accurate when the Yinchorri launched a raid on the Jedi Temple.\n\n\u2022 Raid on the Temple\n\nThe Yinchorri task force found that all the Jedi sleeping quarters were empty. The troops then entered a chamber where they were met by several armed Jedi, including Yoda. In the end, almost all the Yinchorri were killed, and two Jedi died: Jude Rozess and Tieren Nie-Tan.\nYoda interrogated the last remaining Yinchorri and asked him the location of the Yinchorri high command. The soldier responded to the Jedi Master by telling him that he did not know since he was only an ordinary soldier. Yoda then turned to converse with Soon Bayts, a Jedi Knight who brought word from Adi Gallia and Eeth Koth that the high command was not on Yitheeth and that they were heading to Yibikkoror to help Plo Koon and Micah Giiett.\nThese distractions gave the Yinchorri in the Temple enough time to grab his weapon and attempt to shoot the Jedi Master. Yoda, however, used the Force to throw him against a wall, killing him. The Jedi then came to the conclusion that the Yinchorri were misguided rather than bloodthirsty and that the attack may have been the work of an unknown party, rather than the Yinchorri themselves.\n\n\u2022 Endgame\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful raid on the Jedi Temple, the Jedi strike team continued to engage the Yinchorri, while Yoda remained on Coruscant. Master Windu eventually reported to Yoda, informing him that the strike team had discovered the location of the Yinchorris high command, thanks to Master Yaddles knowledge of the Jedi holocrons. The Jedi led an attack on the world, while four navy attack groups authorized by the Senate arrived to help them, concluding the uprising.\n\n\u2022 Invasion of Naboo (32 BBY)\n\nMace Windu and Yoda, about Darth Maul\nIn 32 BBY, the Galactic Senate passed legislation that called for the taxation of trade routes to outlying systems, in an attempt to weaken the ever-expanding Trade Federation, which had grown increasingly powerful&mdash;to the point that it had its own Senate delegation and easily \"persuaded\" Republic weapons inspectors to overlook the arming of the Federation's shipment vessels into lethal battleships.I\n)]]\nAs such, the Federation created an invasion force of battle droids, in addition to their growing fleet of warships, and in protest of the Senate's legislation, blockaded the small world of Naboo. Queen Amidala of Naboo implored the help of the Republic, and as such, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum asked Yoda and the Council to send Jedi to negotiate with the Trade Federation, as ambassadors of the Republic.\nThe Council sent Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with the leadership of the Trade Federation. However, upon the arrival of the Jedi, the Federation attempted to assassinate them and began invading Naboo; the Jedi were able to escape their would-be killers and rescue the Queen of Naboo, Amidala.\nUpon returning to Coruscant, Qui-Gon Jinn brought a young Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi Council, requesting to train him once Obi-Wan Kenobi had completed the trials necessary to become a Jedi Knight, as Jedi could only have one apprentice at a time. Yoda, as the teacher of many of those on the Council, and its most venerable and respected member, played a key role in that bodys initial decision to deny the request. Yoda believed that the boy was clearly affected by his years as a slave and that he still clung too tightly to the memory of his mother to be trained safely. The boys future, Yoda thought, was clouded. Qui-Gon, however, continued to insist that Skywalker was the Chosen One, who would bring balance to the Force.\n\n\u2022 Return of the Sith\n\nCloak of Deception\nIn addition to this supposed Chosen One, Qui-Gon brought news of the return of the Sith; while he and the Queen's entourage had been preparing to depart the planet of Tatooine after having their damaged ship repaired, what appeared to be a Sith Lord confronted the Jedi Master in a lightsaber duel.\nAfter finding the Senate unresponsive to her pleas for aid, Queen Amidala demanded a vote of no confidence in Supreme Chancellor Valorums leadership, before returning to Naboo, where she successfully led a revolt against the occupation of the Trade Federation. During this battle, Qui-Gons mysterious attacker reappeared, and successfully murdered him, though the attacker in turn was defeated by Obi-Wan Kenobi. It became obvious to Yoda and others on the Council that the Sith had indeed returned; however, it was not clear whether the attacker Kenobi \"killed\" was the Sith Master or apprentice.\nFollowing Amidalas call for a vote of no confidence in Valorums leadership of the Senate, Naboos own senator, Palpatine, was elected the new Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. In addition, the Council against Yodas wishes, granted Obi-Wan, now a Jedi Knight, permission to train Anakin Skywalker as a Jedi. He vocally expressed his disapproval of the Councils decision, but reluctantly relented when he learned that Obi-Wan was willing to even go against the decision of the Council if it meant fulfilling Qui-Gons final wish.\nIn circa 31 BBY, the Human Len Markus seized the Darkstaff, an ancient dark side artifact, from the Cularin asteroid belt, causing the Cularin system to disappear from the galaxy for ten years. The event caused a surge of dark-side energy, which was so strong that it almost hospitalized Yoda. However, despite the physical absence of the system, Yoda could sense that the star systems inhabitants were still alive.Below the Belt: Philology\n\n\u2022 Mission to Mawan (25 BBY)\n\nSeven years after the events at Naboo, Yoda went on a negotiation mission to Mawan with Obi-Wan, Anakin and Yaddle. Their goal was to settle a devastating civil war between three crime gangs. These gangs, led by Decca the Hutt, Feeana Tala, and Striker, caused the remainder of the population to take refuge underground. Unbeknownst to them, the chaotic planet was a trap set for the Jedi by Striker, whose true identity was Granta Omega, son of Xanatos. After kidnapping Anakin, he released a deadly chemical weapon that Yaddle intercepted, killing her when she absorbed it through the Force. However, through her sacrifice, she saved the city of Naatan. The weapon was intended by its vengeful maker to kill thousands if he was betrayed by any opposition, and as his insurance to escape offworld, but it failed because of what Yaddle had done. Anakin and Obi-Wan managed to bring peace to Mawan, but Anakin still felt responsible for the death of the Jedi High Council member. Yoda, despite the loss of Yaddle, still managed to convince Decca to evacuate with her illegal operations by \"suggesting\" that the Jedi Council might build a Temple on the planet, which was more than enough to make the criminal flee.Jedi Quest: The Shadow Trap\n\n\u2022 Separatist Crisis (24 BBY&ndash;22 BBY)\n\nPalpatine and Yoda\nSpurred by the failure of the Senate to even vote on the Financial Reform Act, many planets, systems and corporations began to withdraw from the Republic. In addition, and particularly troubling for the Jedi, especially Yoda, the disillusioned former Jedi Count Dooku, who had once studied under Yoda, was the leading voice among these Separatists.II\n\n\u2022 Attempts on Senator Amidala\n\nThe growing threat prompted members of the Senate to call for a Military Creation Act, which would allow Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to create an army for the Republic. The leader of the opposition against this act was Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo. When the time to vote on the act arrived, and Amidala arrived on Coruscant, an attempt was made upon her life, though she survived.\nThe Jedi Council, disturbed by this, had Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, placed in charge of the Senator's safety. Following a second attempt on the life of Amidala, Kenobi and Skywalker captured the bounty hunter responsible, only to have her killed by a second bounty hunter, through the use of a toxic dart, during her interrogation.\nThe Council had Kenobi trace the second bounty hunter, while Skywalker was to accompany Amidala to the safety of her homeworld. Yoda helped Kenobi solve the mystery behind the missing planet Kamino, where the Jedi Knight had traced the origins of the toxic dart; it was Yoda's belief that certain files had been deleted from the Jedi Archives for an unknown purpose. Even more disturbing, only a Jedi would have been capable of erasing the files.\n\n\u2022 Clone army\n\nYoda and Mace Windu\nUpon making his way to Kamino, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered that a massive army of clones was being created, apparently on the orders of the late Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. Kenobi reported this to Masters Mace Windu and Yoda, the senior members of the Council, who had had no knowledge of a clone army. Obi-Wan felt certain that the template of the clone army, a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, was the same bounty hunter who had been involved in the attempts on Senator Amidala's life.\nWhile waiting for Kenobis report, Yoda meditated. He heard the voice of the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn and sensed that something had happened to Anakin Skywalker. He conferred with Windu that the young Padawan was in \"pain. Terrible' pain.\"\nKenobi traced Fett to Geonosis, only to be captured during his report, which detailed his discovery that Count Dooku had formed an alliance of powerful corporations into a Confederacy of Independent Systems. This caused the Senate to grant the Chancellor emergency powers, with which he authorized the Grand Army of the Republic while Senator Amidala and Anakin Skywalker attempted to rescue Kenobi, only to be captured themselves. In response, Master Windu formed a strike team to extract the captured trio, while Yoda went to Kamino in an attempt to discover the truth of the clone army, and also to bring some of those troops to Geonosis.\n\n\u2022 Clone Wars (22 BBY&ndash;19 BBY)\n\n\u2022 Battle of Geonosis\n\nMaster Yoda\n, Count Dooku, on Geonosis.]]\nWindu and the Jedi were confronted by a huge droid army under the command of Count Dooku, with only a handful surviving, when, with the rank of General, Yoda arrived with a contingent of the new clone army. Yoda commanded the forces of the Republic, before feeling a disturbance in the Force.\nMaster Yoda arrived in a hangar to confront Dooku, after he had grievously wounded Skywalker and Kenobi. After deflecting Dooku's Force powers, among which was Force lightning, Yoda realized that Dooku had turned to the dark side of the Force, becoming a Sith Lord. A lightsaber duel began between the two, with Dooku faring well against his old master. Yet, as the duel progressed the Grand Master of the Jedi showed speed and agility so incredible that it began to overwhelm Dooku, plus he was the only one save for one other being in the galaxy that held skill enough with a blade equal or even greater than the Makashi master. Yoda almost defeated Dooku, but the Sith Lord used the Force to drop a pillar over Obi-Wan and Anakin. While Yoda concentrated on stopping the massive construction from crushing the two Jedi, Dooku made his escape.\nThough the Republic won the First Battle of Geonosis under the direction of Yoda, many Jedi were killed. More importantly, the thousand-year peace that had existed since the Seventh Battle of Ruusan had ended. Yoda sensed that the Clone Wars would be a long and tumultuous period for both the Republic and the Jedi Order, and indeed they were, shaking the galaxy to its very core. During the Clone Wars, Yoda, along with many other Jedi Masters, was forced to become a general fighting in various battles for the Republic on worlds across the galaxy.Star Wars: Clone Wars\n\n\u2022 Frontline warrior\n\n20\n]]\nShortly after the beginning of the war, Yoda took the title of Master of the Order from Mace Windu. Early in the conflict, Yoda saw front-line action at the Battle of Axion, leading clone troopers into battle atop his kybuck steed. On that contested world, he saved the life of Commander Brolis, and in the process defeated a Hailfire droid in single combat. Around the time of the Battle of Muunilinst, Yoda came to the rescue of Jedi, Luminara Unduli and Barriss Offee, with the help of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo after the Crystal Caves on Ilum were destroyed by chameleon droids. Yoda sensed Unduli and Offees peril through the Force, and during his rescue mission destroyed dozens of chameleon droids, before rescuing the pair. On Ilum, Yoda learned that Dooku's treachery ran deeper than he had believed, for the former Jedi Master had ordered the attack on the crystal temple.\n's death]]\nYoda had lost his former Padawan to the dark side before the war began, but during the conflict, Yoda lost another good friend. King Alaric of Thustra was planning to secede his homeworld to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, although he intended to rejoin the Republic when the corruption he had witnessed was gone. Yoda traveled to Thustra to speak with Alaric, but his old friend was resolute, and eventually, his world became embroiled in battle. Unwilling to face the state of his world, Alaric drew a blaster on Yoda, knowing his friend would be forced to defend himself. Left with no choice, Yoda deflected the bolt into the body of the King. Yoda lamented the fall of his friend, but more worrying was how even he had been forced to draw his blade in battle, and feared he would have to draw it again in many battles to come.Jedi: Yoda\nThe Jedi Grand Master oversaw many missions from the Jedi Temple as well, sifting through several intelligence reports and working with the Council to determine which to act upon. He learned through Obi-Wan Kenobi that Dexter Jettster was a reliable informant, and soon learned to place his trust in Bail Organa as well after the senator revealed information of a hitherto unknown Sith planet designated Zigoola. Kenobi and Organa soon departed to bring an end to the planet, and Yoda and Mace Windu meditated and lent their support from afar, sensing the completion of their mission upon its closure and calling upon Padm\u00e9 Amidala once more to go and retrieve them.The Clone Wars: Wild Space\nWhen the Republic was contacted by crime lord Jabba the Hutt, in regards to his missing son, Rotta, and offered the Republic use of Hutt hyperspace lanes, should the Republic rescue the missing Huttlet, it became apparent that the only Jedi the Order could spare for the mission were Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. However, the two were embroiled in an ongoing conflict on Christophsis, and communications were impossible. As such, Yoda sent a youngling, Ahsoka Tano, to inform the pair of their new mission, and in addition, assigned her as Skywalkers Padawan. The trio eventually succeeded in rescuing Jabbas son, allowing the Republic to use unknown Hutt hyperspace lanes, an advantage the Confederacy did not have.Star Wars: The Clone Wars film\n\n\u2022 Rugosa\n\nAccept the challenge I do, Your Highness. Arrive by nightfall, I will'.\nShortly after, Yoda was selected to lead diplomatic relations with the Toydarian King Katuunko, as the Republic wished to build a base in his system to further combat the Confederacy in the Outer Rim Territories. However, the Confederacy intercepted communications between the king and the Republic with the newly built Skytop Station, and, hoping to derail the negotiations, Separatist leader Count Dooku sent his apprentice Asajj Ventress to the neutral moon of Rugosa, where the negotiations were scheduled to take place. When Master Yodas warship arrived at Rugosa, it was immediately set upon by several Separatist cruisers; however, Yoda refused to be deterred, and escaped the frenzy via escape pod along with three clone troopers, and landed safely on the moons surface.Ambush\nOnce on the moon, the Jedi Grand Master contacted Katuunko, and after becoming aware of Ventresss presence, agreed to a wager: should Yoda defeat Ventress best troops, Toydaria would join the Republic; however, should Ventresss forces overwhelm Yoda, then the king would ally his system with the Confederacy. Katuunko insisted that the Dark Jedi ensure Yoda be given a fair fight, to which she agreed. After returning to her base, Ventress contacted Dooku and stated that her forces were being deployed. She did not intend for Yoda to get his fair fight and dispatched the recently promoted 224 with the task of leading the droid forces, and the battle droids prepared to ambush the Republics diplomatic squad. Led by 224 in his Armored Assault Tank, the main column of Confederate forces advanced into the jungle. Yoda and his men made their way to the rendezvous position on a different path, as the Jedi Master was certain that their enemies were already heading toward them. The droids began to go through the coral of the jungle, but the dense foliage prevented the tanks from advancing.\nYoda and the clones split up, seeking to use their surroundings to their advantage.Ambush The clones engaged a squad of B1 battle droids from the south and managed to defeat them, but B2 super battle droids then came to attack the clones, and the three were forced to flee. Yoda, meanwhile, was able to defeat an entire squad of droids on his own without even using his lightsaber. CC-4477 was hit by a rocket fired by a B2-HA series super battle droid and was wounded in the leg. Yoda appeared and aided the clones, using the Force to turn around a battle droid and destroy the rest of the squad. Droidekas soon appeared, and the Republic forces fled. Yoda, clinging onto CC-4477's back, deflected the lasers at a nearby tall formation of land coral, causing the droids to be squashed and the four escaped to a cave to rest. The clones learned that they were low on ammunition, but the Jedi Master imparted his wisdom on the clone troopers to further inspire their efforts.\nAfter hearing the sounds of the droids approaching in the distance, Yoda and the clones exited the cave. The Jedi and his men arrived on a ridge to observe the advancing droids below, which were passing through a narrow pathway. Yoda left the clones on the ridge and faced three tanks and a large number of droids alone. The Jedi Master destroyed all of them, along with 224, leaving Katuunko amused and Ventress angry. However, Ventress did not give up easily; the Dark Acolyte broke the terms of the competition and secretly sent several droidekas to deal with the Jedi Master. As Yoda destroyed the last Confederate tank, the droidekas arrived, and the Jedi Master began blocking their laser attacks. CC-4477 launched the last of the rockets at an overhanging rock above the canyon, causing an avalanche to crush the droids. Yoda then led the clones to the rendezvous point, remarking that it was not polite to be late.\nKatuunko was greatly amused by the droids defeat. Through a holotransmission, the king informed Dooku that one Jedi was not worth a hundred battle droids, but rather a thousand, and stated that he would be joining the Republic. The count urged him to reconsider, but the Toydarian king refused to deal with those who went back on their promises, as Ventress had broken the terms of the competition. Seeing that his plan had failed, Dooku ordered Ventress to kill the king, believing that negotiations might go smoother with his successor. Katuunkos guards tried to stop the Dark Acolyte, but Ventress merely Force-pushed them aside, knocking them unconscious. As Ventress attacked the king with her paired lightsabers, she was confronted by Yoda, having arrived in time to save the king.\nYoda used the Force to stop the Dark Acolytes death blow from being struck. As Ventress droid escorts were dispatched by the clones, Yoda disarmed Ventress herself, and after examining her lightsabers, the Jedi returned them to her, having proven they were useless against his telekinesis, while commenting that she still had much to learn. Ventress was outnumbered, and Yoda suggested that she surrender. In order to escape, Ventress detonated pre-planted explosives and caused the hillside adjacent to the Republic forces to collapse. Yoda was forced to telekinetically stop the rocks from crushing all of them, and as he did so, Ventress seized the opportunity and fled to her ship. Dooku, watching the events unfold through the holoprojector, commented before taking his leave that it was a pity that he had not been there himself.\nWith the Confederate threat over, Yoda was able to enter into negotiations with Katuunko. The king stated that discussions were unnecessary, however, as the Jedi had already proven his worth. Katuunko presented his ceremonial sword to Yoda and entrusted him with his planets protection while pledging Toydarias support to the Republic, declaring that it would be an honor to fight on their side.\n\n\u2022 The Malevolence\n\nAfter the appearance of a mysterious Separatist super weapon that had ambushed several Republic fleets and left no survivors, Yoda and the Council sent one among its number, Jedi Master Plo Koon, to track down the unknown threat. After Master Koon discovered the weapon, he contacted the Jedi general in the closest system to him, Anakin Skywalker. However, during the transmission, Koons communication systems were jammed, and the Republic lost contact with his fleet. Masters Yoda, Windu and Kenobi, in conjunction with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, agreed that sending a task force to search for survivors of the latest attack would prove risky; however, Skywalker disobeyed their orders, and through his Padawan Ahsoka Tanos unique connection through the Force to Master Koon, rescued the stranded Jedi Master and his few remaining troops. With Master Koon alive to report on the nature of the Separatist weapon, the Republic learned that the Separatists had acquired giant ion cannons capable of disabling any fleet.Rising Malevolence\nA plan devised and instigated by Skywalker proved able to destroy the Malevolence primary weapon, and later, during a mission to rescue the captive Senator Amidala of Naboo, the giant warship was rigged to pilot itself into a nearby moon, destroying it, and freeing the Republic from the danger it represented.Destroy Malevolence'\n\n\u2022 Gunray's capture\n\nA short time later, Senator Amidala captured important Separatist leader Nute Gunray on Rodia. As such, the Council sent Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Padawan Ahsoka Tano to escort the viceroy to Coruscant, where he would face trial for war crimes. While guarding the viceroy, Master Unduli was to interrogate him, in the hopes of learning important Separatist secrets.Cloak of Darkness\nHowever, Unduli's starship came under Separatist assault and was boarded by large numbers of droids. Though Unduli defeated the droids, she was unprepared for the far greater adversary that had infiltrated the ship: Asajj Ventress. Ventress dueled both Unduli and Tano, holding them off while her secret ally, the Senate Commando Faro Argyus, betrayed his fellows and rescued Gunray. After receiving word of this, Ventress escaped the Jedi, who were left to explain the catastrophe to Master Yoda.\nYoda was particularly disturbed by the betrayal of Argyus, as he felt it revealed that the Republics enemies were everywhere. However, he supported Master Undulis proposal that Master Kit Fisto move to recapture Gunray, his escape ship having been tracked, as the Nautolans fleet was nearer the viceroys last known position.\nFisto was largely led on a wild bantha chase, however. Rather than recapturing Gunray, the Nautolan was forced to duel General Grievous and to watch his former Padawan, Nahdar Vebb, die at the cyborgs hands. After he escaped, Fisto reported to the Council in the persons of Mace Windu and Yoda. Yoda lamented that Vebbs death was largely the result of his own hubris and feared that in the war there was a danger of the Jedi losing the very essence of who they were.Lair of Grievous\n\n\u2022 Dealing with pirates\n\nSkywalker and Kenobi later launched a mission to capture the heart of the Confederacy, Count Dooku, though they were unsuccessful. However, where Skywalker and Kenobi failed, lowly pirates succeeded and contacted the Chancellors office demanding a reward in return for the Sith Lord. Yoda confirmed that the lightsaber handled by the head of the pirate organization, Hondo Ohnaka, was indeed his former apprentices.Dooku Captured\nUnder the advice of Senator Amidala, the Council sent Kenobi and Skywalker to confirm Dookus capture, which they ultimately did. However, Ohnaka had them captured in addition to Dooku, in the hopes of garnering a further reward from the Republic. Though Skywalker and Kenobi ultimately escaped with the help of the Republic dignitaries sent to deliver the reward, it came at the expense of the respected Senator Kharrus life, while Dooku managed to escape capture.The Gungan General\n\n\u2022 Blue Shadow Virus\n\nLater, the Naboo contacted the Council and asked Masters Windu and Yoda to send two Jedi, specifically Kenobi and Skywalker due to their relations with the native Gungans, to help uncover a Separatist bio-lab believed to have been established on world. While the Jedi did discover the lab and prepare its resident scientist Dr. Nuvo Vindi for trial, a deadly virus he had prepared, the Blue Shadow Virus, was released, infecting Senator Amidala and Ahsoka Tano. They were administered the rare antidote before the virus could claim them.Blue Shadow Virus (episode)Mystery of a Thousand Moons\n\n\u2022 Ryloth\n\nLater, when Master Windu led an assault on the planet Ryloth aimed at freeing the Twi'leki population from Separatist occupation, Yoda remained on Coruscant. However, the diminutive Jedi Master acted as advisor to Windu and was involved in tactical discussions regarding how to capture the capital city of Lessu. Yoda counseled Windu that it was important that the Separatist leader Wat Tambor, who was responsible for the occupation of Ryloth, be captured to answer for his many war crimes. Ultimately, Windu agreed with Master Yoda and was able to capture the Separatist Council member at the conclusion of the Battle of Ryloth.Liberty on Ryloth\n\n\u2022 Stolen holocron\n\nGrand Master]] Yoda\nFollowing the First Battle of Felucia, Master Yoda presided over a meeting of the Jedi Council which heard that Padawan Ahsoka Tano had refused to comply with orders given to her by her superior Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. In punishment for her actions, Ahsoka was appointed as a guard of the Jedi Archives in order to spend time away from the battlefield.Holocron Heist\nLater, while discussing the impact the defeat at Felucia would have on Republic war efforts in the region with Master Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Yoda was overcome by a disturbance in the Force which revealed to him that intruders planned to infiltrate the Jedi Temple. Kenobi and Skywalker incorrectly deduced that the culprits would attempt to steal the Jedi Order's transmission codes, and as such, focused their efforts on securing the codes. Yoda later sensed the arrival of the intruders and suggested to Kenobi and Skywalker that their enemies may head to the Jedi Temple communication center. The Grand Master then met there with Masters Mace Windu, Kit Fisto and Aayla Secura after having placed the Temple on high alert.\nAs Kenobi and Skywalker tracked the intruders through the Temple's ventilation system, Master Yoda deduced that it was likely that the intruders were receiving assistance from within the Temple considering their ability to avoid the two Jedi trailing them. As such, the diminutive Master contacted Ahsoka Tano and cautioned her that he sensed deception and that there was somebody in the Archives impersonating a Jedi. Fortunately, Tano was able to subdue the impostor, a Clawdite changeling named Cato Parasitti, who had been impersonating Master Jocasta Nu and feeding her employer Cad Bane information from the Jedi Archives.\nNonetheless, Banes scheme worked, as he was able to keep the Jedi off his tail long enough to break into the Holocron Chamber and steal a Jedi holocron as ordered by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. However, Parasitti revealed to the Jedi that Banes next target was Jedi Master Bolla Ropal. This allowed the Jedi to deduce that Bane was after the Kyber memory crystal in Ropal's keeping, which when combined with a holocron would reveal a list of all known Force-sensitive children in the galaxy.\nWhile Skywalker and Tano were dispatched to protect Master Ropal, they were ultimately too late; Ropal was captured and died under torture, refusing to use the Force to help Bane unite the holocron and Kyber crystal. However, the Jedi believed that Bane himself was killed during the Battle of Devaron, though he later proved to have survived. Prior to faking his death, Bane was able to coerce Skywalker into uniting the holocron and memory crystal, and as such, the bounty hunter began collecting the Force-sensitive children on behalf of Sidious.Cargo of Doom\nLater, Yoda led Windu, Kenobi and Skywalker in using the Force to pinpoint which children would be targeted by Bane. Yoda sensed that a child on Rodia was in danger, as well as one on Naboo. However, when Master Windu asserted that a child from Glee Anselm was being targeted by Bane, Yoda revealed that the infant had already been claimed by the bounty hunter and that the dark side hid his fate. Kenobi proved unable to prevent Bane from capturing the Rodian, but Skywalker and his Padawan captured Bane when he ventured to Naboo.\nMasters Kenobi and Windu then used Bane to relocate the stolen holocron, though the bounty hunter escaped in the process. However, even without Bane, Skywalker and his Padawan discovered a secret facility on Mustafar where the captured children were hidden, and ultimately rescued them.\n\n\u2022 The Zillo Beast\n\nWhen Supreme Chancellor Palpatine discovered the Zillo Beast on Malastare and ordered it brought to Coruscant for research, it promptly escaped and made a beeline for the Senate building, necessitating the interference of Yoda and the Jedi Order. Dismissing Mace Windus suggestion to shoot the beast down with stun rays, Yoda and Aayla Secura clambered atop the beasts back, distracting it with their lightsabers to buy Republic forces time to rescue the shuttle in the creatures grasp with Palpatine, Anakin Skywalker, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala inside. When all the shuttles occupants were brought to safety, Yoda aided Secura and Skywalker in protecting the group from the toxin-bombs detonated to kill the beast.The Zillo Beast Strikes Back\n\n\u2022 Savage Opress\n\nWitches of the Mist\nYoda and Mace Windu later showed Obi-Wan Kenobi footage of a recent massacre on Devaron, in which Jedi Master Halsey and his Padawan Knox were brutally murdered by an unknown assassin. The footage baffled Kenobi, for he believed he had killed the Sith Lord Darth Maul, but Yoda pointed out that it was a creature of the same species from Dathomir. Yoda tasked Kenobi with going to Dathomir to find this threat and defeat it.Witches of the Mist\n\n\u2022 Mortis communication\n\nThe Jedi Council later received a mysterious transmission which was over two thousand years old. After the Council reviewed the ancient transmission, they dispatched Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano to uncover if it was a Separatist trap. As a precaution, they sent a heavily armed fleet to accompany them.\nWhen the trio returned, Yoda learned from Kenobi that they encountered three beings: the Father, Son and Daughter, who resembled the light and dark sides of the Force.\n\n\u2022 Rescue of Even Piell\n\nJedi Master and councilor Even Piell was taken prisoner by Separatist forces after he recovered the Nexus Route coordinates, which were crucial to the war effort. As a result, the Jedi Council set up a rescue attempt, with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in charge. Ahsoka Tano also went along, disobeying orders to stay.\nBut the rescue attempt failed, and the team split up and later rejoined after their ship was destroyed. Yoda, Mace Windu, Saesee Tiin and Plo Koon then set up a rescue mission for the team, with Koon, Tiin, Adi Gallia and Kit Fisto successfully extracting them; however, Piell lost his life.\nWith the coordinates in the hands of both Ahsoka Tano and Piell's Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, Yoda decided to meet with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, as Tano vowed to Piell to give it to the Council, while Tarkin vowed to give it to the Chancellor.\n\n\u2022 Padawan lost\n\nAhsoka Tano vanished in a battle on the world of Felucia. After some time, a ship piloted by bounty hunters Sugi and Seripas came to the Jedi Temple with a band of Wookiees, and two Jedi younglings. Among them was Tano. Yoda and Mace Windu watched as Tano and Anakin Skywalker paid their mutual respects to each other in satisfaction.\n\n\u2022 Mon Calamari\n\nGungan Attack\nYoda and Mace Windu then made contact with Anakin Skywalker, Gial Ackbar and Senator Amidala, who were on Dac to cool down tensions between the Mon Calamari and the Separatist-aligned Quarren. When Kit Fisto and Ahsoka Tano went to aid their forces on the planet, they soon lost contact after the Republic was almost decimated by Separatist commander Riff Tamson.\nAs a result of this, the Jedi held a special session to discuss how to proceed. Saesee Tiin suggested that they find a nearby underwater race with an army to aid their allies, and Obi-Wan Kenobi pointed out Naboo. Yoda then contacted the Gungan boss, Lyonie, who dispatched Jar Jar Binks to lead the army to Mon Cala.\n\n\u2022 Aleen relief mission\n\nWhen several earthquakes struck the Aleena world of Aleen, Commander Wolffe and his team were sent to the planet with relief supplies as well as Senator Amidala's droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. Yoda also appeared in the transmission sent to Wolffe.\n\n\u2022 Rise of the Zygerrian Empire\n\nKidnapped\nYoda then made contact with Governor Roshti of planet Kiros to warn him that he could not trust Dooku and the Separatist cause. Roshti said it was out of his hands, as the Separatists had already arrived. Yoda promised to send assistance, in the form of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka Tano along with their forces.\nShortly after they won a battle there, the three appeared in holographic form alongside Admiral Wullf Yularen, who reported that he ran a scan but found none of the Togruta colonists&mdash;who were not even on the planet.\n\n\u2022 Kenobi's \"demise\"\n\nCriminal mastermind Moralo Eval hatched a scheme to abduct Supreme Chancellor Palpatine at the Festival of Light on Naboo with the aid of Dooku and a cadre of bounty hunters. The Jedi tried to make a deal with Eval for information, to no avail, so devised their own plan to thwart the attack. Obi-Wan Kenobi would fake his death via assassination and pose as the killer to infiltrate Dooku's team and send them information about the attack.\nWhen the deed was done, Yoda attended the mock funeral for Kenobi and later visited with Mace Windu as Kenobi underwent his facial transformation. Yoda and Windu received various communications from Kenobi, and later, he told Anakin Skywalker the truth about Kenobi's \"demise.\" With the aid of Kenobi, Dooku fled, the Chancellor was rescued, and Eval, Cad Bane, Twazzi and Embo were apprehended in Theed.\n\n\u2022 Return of Darth Maul\n\nRevenge (episode)\nThe Jedi later received a transmission that came from the Outer Rim world of Raydonia. To the horror of the Jedi, the person that sent the communication was the presumed dead Sith Lord Darth Maul, the one who murdered Qui-Gon Jinn eleven years before.\nMaul said that if Kenobi did not face him, he would destroy the planet, after he killed a group of people in the communication. Kenobi said that he could defeat Maul as he once did, and left for Raydonia. Mace Windu expressed his doubts about Kenobi's skill, but Yoda said he may gain an unexpected ally in his quest.\nKenobi returned, and the Jedi learned that Maul had teamed with his brother Savage Opress, the one that massacred the forces at Devaron. Many teams were sent to capture the two Nightbrothers on many worlds from Pleems Nexus, Orto Norwe, Paklan and Moorjhone. Each Jedi met their end to the two Siths blades, Bruu Jun-Fan, Ko Solok, Grohto, Judd and Salmara all lost their lives.\nKenobi and Adi Gallia soon tracked the two Sith from their last known location to Florrum&mdash;where Master Gallia was killed. Yoda, Windu, Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker met with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to inform him of Maul's return and his plans for the future, but the Chancellor dismissed it, believing that Kenobi took it too personally. Yoda reaffirmed this, but said that when they resurfaced, the Jedi would be swift.\n\n\u2022 Onderon\n\nYoda attended a session of the Jedi Council when rebels Saw Gerrera and Lux Bonteri sent a transmission with a plea for assistance in the rebellion against the Separatist droid army led by the corrupt ruler King Sanjay Rash, who ousted the previous monarch.\nThe Council said that they would not intervene in their affairs as the planet made their intentions at the start of the war, but promised to send some of their own to train and advise them. Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex were sent.\n\n\u2022 The Gathering on Ilum\n\nYoda then traveled to Ilum, where he awaited Ahsoka Tano and a clan of initiates who were deemed ready to construct their own lightsabers in the ancient ritual known as the Gathering. When Tano arrived with the younglings in the temple there, Yoda showed his own lightsaber and explained to them what they needed to do.\nWhen the younglings went inside to find their own crystal, Petro was the first to come out, but Yoda was quick to point out his flaw for certainty and said that he found a crystal, but brought water to them&mdash;that is, a water crystal. He directed Petro back inside. The other younglings, Gungi, Byph, Ganodi, Katooni and Zatt, each came out later. The students then went on to make their personal lightsabers.\n\n\u2022 Attack on the Jedi Temple\n\nDuring the peak of the war, Barriss Offee with the help of Letta Turmond bombed the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Yoda then ordered Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano to return from Cato Neimoidia to help investigate, refusing to trust anyone who was in the temple during the bombing. Yoda's judgement was clouded, but he still guided the Jedi as the leader of the Council.Sabotage (episode)\nTurmond was captured by Skywalker and Tano. In prison, she requested Tano speak with her, saying Tano was the only one she could trust. When Turmond was strangled to death via the Force, and several clones were murdered by a lightsaber, Republic Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin accused Tano of being the mastermind responsible for the attack. When Tano escaped the prison, desperate to prove her innocence, Tarkin ordered her captured. This resulted in a manhunt led by Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex, during which Tano lost her shoto-style lightsaber and escaped.The Jedi Who Knew Too Much\nAfter Tano eluded her master and fled to the Underworld, Yoda ordered Skywalker and Plo Koon to track her down and bring her to the temple. Tano was quickly captured by Asajj Ventress, now a bounty hunter after having been betrayed by Dooku, who agreed to help the young Padawan in exchange for a pardon for Ventress' crimes as a Sith. Tano contacted Barriss Offee at the Jedi temple. Offee led Tano into a trap by telling her she could find evidence to prove her innocence by going to a warehouse on Level 1315. There, Offee jumped Ventress, stealing her lightsabers and mask. She attacked Tano, knocking her out in front of crates of nano-droids and effectively framing her for the bombing.To Catch a Jedi\nTano was eventually brought back to the temple, where Yoda reluctantly agreed to expel her from the Jedi Order and have her face a Republic military tribunal before the Senate. Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Plo Koon, and several other members of the Jedi Council were in the Senate Chambers when Skywalker brought Barriss Offee before the Chancellor, where she confessed to being responsible for the bombings and for framing Tano. In light of this revelation, Yoda and the rest of the Council personally invited Tano to rejoin the Order, but she refused and left. Yoda would regret the Council's decision and began to question the doctrine of the war.The Wrong Jedi\n\n\u2022 Clone crisis\n\nPrior to the war, Darth Sidious and his apprentice, Darth Tyranus, secretly created the Clone Army with the assistance of an unsuspecting Sifo-Dyas, who had seen visions of a conflict beforehand. When this was done, they had organic inhibitor chips implanted in their brains. which caused the clones to do anything Palpatine told them to, in this case execute the Jedi. With one simple command, the clones would enter a trance-like state and perform whatever orders they were given.Conspiracy\nDuring the Battle of Ringo Vinda, Clone Trooper Tup murdered Jedi Master Tiplar when his inhibitor chip was activated prematurely. Sidious ordered Tyranus to apprehend Tup to prevent the Jedi from discovering the truth. Tup was eventually sent to Kamino after Anakin Skywalker, Captain Rex, and ARC trooper Fives were able to recover Tup from a Separatist Transport.The Unknown\nAfter escorting Tup to Kamino, Fives and Rex were greeted by Jedi Master Shaak Ti, alongside the main developer of the clones, Kaminoan scientist Nala Se. Rex returned to Ringo Vinda while Fives remained on Kamino to undergo examination in case Fives had a similar situation. Disputes over the tests led to a debate. While Shaak Ti advised a brain scan, Nala Se suggested terminating the clone and performing an autopsy to isolate the case. Shaak Ti contacted the Jedi Temple where Yoda, alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi, decided Tup should be brought to the temple to be examined through the Force.\nWhat the Jedi were unaware of was that the Kaminoans knew of the inhibitor chips and were working with Count Dooku, who used his Sith name, Tyranus, to prevent the Jedi from making the connection. Dooku ordered that Tup be terminated and that the chip be sent to him to be looked at.\nAngry at Nala Se and Master Ti for their treatment of Tup, Fives escaped the medical center and embarked on his own plan. Fives faked leaving the planet, but stayed to try and save Tup and discover the truth. He and the medical droid AZI-3 were able to perform a brain scan on Tup, where they learned of the inhibitor chips. Fives had the droid take the chip out of his and Tup's brains. Unfortunately, the already-weakened Tup died soon after the operation, whispering his last words to Fives. Fives blamed Nala Se for what happened to Tup. Suspecting the Kaminoans of treachery, and with the support of Master Ti, Fives insisted on presenting his evidence and the removed chips directly to Palpatine. Fives was eventually brought to Coruscant, at the request of Shaak Ti, where he was brought before the Chancellor. As the ship landed, Nala Se drugged Fives, causing him to act strange.Fugitive\nWhen Fives attempted to assassinate Palpatine, Yoda and the rest of the Jedi Council ordered Anakin Skywalker to investigate. Fives was killed in the end, and Yoda was ultimately told that the doctors had found another cause, and that a vaccination had been prepared, in case of a future incident.Orders (episode)\n\n\u2022 Uncovering the truth\n\nYoda and Mace Windu\nSometime later, the Jedi received a distress signal from a moon near Oba Diah. Plo Koon and Commander Wolffe, sent to investigate, found the remains of a shuttle and the lightsaber of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who was killed sometime around the Battle of Naboo while dealing with a conflict on Felucia. Upon reviewing the temple archives, Jocasta Nu and the Jedi found that the information had been sealed by order of the Supreme Chancellor. While sending Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Felucia, Yoda went to speak with Chancellor Palpatine. The latter directed Yoda to Finis Valorum, who had been Supreme Chancellor when these events took place. Anakin and Obi-Wan attempted to communicate with the native tribe on Felucia, but were unable to understand them. They did learn, however, that a second Jedi had shown up with Sifo-Dyas.The Lost One\nValorum told Yoda that he sent Sifo-Dyas to negotiate with the Pyke Syndicate to stop a booming drug trade underneath Coruscant. Valorum also revealed that he kept this secret, fearing his opponents in the bureaucracy. The talks were postponed after the Council sent Sifo-Dyas to intervene on Felucia. Valorum was unable to identify the second Jedi, but did say that his assistant, Silman, was with Sifo-Dyas when he was shot down.\nEventually, Yoda dispatched Anakin and Obi-Wan to Oba Diah, where they learned the Pykes were paid to shoot down the ship carrying Sifo-Dyas, but had kept Silman captive as leverage and that Dooku was in fact the individual known as Tyranus, leading them to realize Dooku impersonated Sifo-Dyas to help push forward the Clone Wars. Yoda, not knowing how to stop the plot, suggested the Jedi keep the discovery a secret, and that they should keep playing the Sith Lord's game.\n\n\u2022 Discovering immortality\n\nWhile meditating during the end of the war, Yoda heard the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn, who demonstrated his presence by levitating Yoda. The encounter left Yoda distracted during the subsequent Council gathering, leaving them worried about whether the stresses of the war were finally taking its toll on him. While strolling through the Temple gardens, Yoda was greeted by Anakin. Yoda asked him about his encounter with Qui-Gon's spirit on Mortis, which Anakin had dismissed as a trick, noting the Jedi belief that one could not retain their identity after becoming one with the Force. Yoda responded that he now questioned this dogma.Voices\nYoda confessed what happened to the Council, much to their disbelief. They agreed though to meditate with him, to verify his experience. Despite meditating together for an entire day, they were unable to hear anything. Ki-Adi Mundi expressed worry that Yoda had become susceptible to Sith manipulation, so Yoda underwent medical tests that revealed that he was still in good health. Jedi Doctor Rig Nema suggested Yoda undergo a deprivation ritual that would allow him to meditate more strongly and find the source of the voice.\nAgreeing, Yoda was suspended in a liquid tank with an oxygen mask to bring him as close as possible to death without actually becoming one with the Force. While unconscious, Qui-Gons voice requested Yoda go to Dagobah, and to tell no one about it. After, Obi-Wan broke open the tank due to his concern over Yodas failing life signs.\nPut on bedrest and under guard, Yoda convinced Anakin to help him escape by posing as simply accompanying each other for a walk. Guided to the Jedi Temple Hangar, Anakin lent Yoda his astromech droid R2-D2 to accompany him to his personal interceptor. Yoda and R2-D2 flew to Dagobah, where Yoda asked the droid to stay with their ship while he found a clearing to meditate.\nQui-Gon's voice greeted him. Yoda asked why he could not see him. Qui-Gon explained he had not been fully trained enough to do so. The Living Force appeared to Yoda in the form of fireflies, guiding Yoda to a cave strong with the dark side, it showed the Jedi Master a vision of the future, where a hooded Sith Lord slaughtered the Jedi. Qui-Gon explained to a distraught Yoda that he would help him bring hope for the future, and directed him to the planet that spawned the midi-chlorians.Destiny (The Clone Wars)\nArriving there, Yoda gave his lightsaber to R2-D2 for safekeeping, and descended into the world to meet the Force Priestesses, who agreed to teach him how to achieve life after death. First, Yoda confronted a manifestation of his own dark side, conquering his hubris. Next, he witnessed a vision of the Jedi massacred in the Temple, where an apparition of Katooni invited him to enter a peaceful courtyard to escape these painful events. Seeing Qui-Gon, Kenobi, Ahsoka and Dooku together, alive and full Jedi, Yoda recognized the vision's falsehood, overcoming its temptation and his attachment to those that have fallen.\nInstructed to complete his tests on the Sith homeworld of Moraband, Yoda and R2-D2 flew to the valley where the ancient Sith Lords were buried. Recognizing the danger, Yoda instructed R2-D2 to return to the Jedi Temple and inform the Council of what happened, if he did not come back after three nights. Spectres of a serpent, undead Sith warriors and even Darth Bane himself confronted him, but Yoda brushed them off. As he entered a temple execution chamber, the Force Priestesses warned Yoda that whatever he encountered there would be beyond their control.Sacrifice (episode)\nUnknown to Yoda, Darth Sidious and Dooku sensed his presence on Moraband, and met in an abandoned tower in the industrial sector of Coruscant. Using Dooku and Yoda's Force bond, Sidious planned to reach out to Yoda and crush his spirit. Appearing to Yoda in the form of Sifo-Dyas, Sidious had Yoda wake up in a Republic attack gunship with Anakin and members of the 501st Legion, en route to terminate the Sith on Coruscant. As they arrived, the clones, led by Captain Rex, rushed at Dooku only to be hit with Sith lightning. Anakin immediately attacked Dooku while Sidious fled. Walking sadly past the fallen clones, a dismayed Yoda witnessed Anakin decapitate Dooku. However, he left Anakin and pursued Sidious.\nEmerging on a catwalk, Yoda and Sidious ignited their lightsabers and engaged in a fierce duel that took them further away from the industrial tower. Anakin eventually caught up with the pair, engaging Sidious in lightsaber combat alongside the Grand Master. Yoda was able to throw Sidious away from them with a Force push, but Anakin foolishly took the chance to attack Sidious while he was still on the ground. The Dark Lord rose to his feet and immediately proceeded to Force-choke Anakin before rendering him unconscious with Force lightning. Sidious then turned his lightning upon Yoda, who immediately began to deflect it with his bare hands by using tutaminis, advancing upon Sidious and closing the gap between them. Although both struggled with the effort of overcoming the other, Yoda was able to cause Sidious to begin to slowly reel backwards with the strength of his counterattack before the combination of their powers caused an explosion that blasted them apart. Sidious was sent toppling over the catwalks banisters while Yoda was able to maintain his ground. Yoda immediately looked for a seemingly vanished Sidious only to witness the latter damaging the catwalk with his lightsaber from below. Yoda leapt after him, but Yodas attention soon became divided between Force-lifting Anakin to save him from falling to his death and blocking Sidious Sith lightning with his lightsaber. After Sidious taunted him by suggesting he sacrifice Anakin to concentrate on defeating him, Yoda put down his lightsaber to ensure Anakins safety only to be hit with lightning. As the catwalk collapsed, Yoda maneuvered Anakin to safety and prevented Sidious escaping by severing the collapsing catwalk with his lightsaber, dragging Sidious down too. The incident proved Yoda's selflessness and demonstrated his resolve to Sidious, who concluded the illusion as he realized it would take more to defeat the Jedi Master.\nYoda awoke and was greeted by a Priestess, who explained he would continue his training with Qui-Gons spirit. As she disappeared in a glow of light, Yoda had a vision of the future, including his own death. Yoda returned to the Jedi Temple, where Windu and Kenobi greeted him in the garden. Yoda claimed his journey had been uneventful, but wondered if Jedi had been wrong to wage the war on the Republics behalf. (Though, despite his fears, he never gave up opposing the Sith.)\n\n\u2022 Vjun\n\n]]\nNear the end of the war, Yoda journeyed to the planet Vjun after receiving a communication from Count Dooku, stating his intention to defect. Although Yoda was well aware of Dookus treachery, he could not help but hope the counts plea was sincere, and that his former student was, at last, trying to find his way home.\nTaking Jedi Masters Maks Leem, Jai Maruk, and their Padawans Whie Malreaux and Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy, Yoda traveled secretly to Vjun. However, along the way, Asajj Ventress tracked and captured the foursome, and unleashed new assassin droids. Killing Leem and Maruk, Ventress tried to destroy the space station to kill Yoda. The little green creature, using the help of his media doppelg\u00e4nger, destroyed Ventress ship, allowing them to escape. Yoda rendezvoused with Dooku in Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux and confronted the Sith Lord over his choice to join the dark side. Dooku attempted to convert Yoda, but the Jedi Master easily pushed aside Dookus hollow promises. Instead, Yoda tried to persuade Dooku to rejoin the Jedi Order, and it appeared his words had a profound effect on Dooku. The unexpected intervention of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker hardened Dookus resolve, however, and Yoda was forced into a second duel with the count. Just as their duel on Geonosis, Yodas fallen apprentice showed proficiency in lightsaber combat nigh akin to his own, even managed to pierce the Jedi Grandmaster's centuries worth of lightsaber knowledge by delivering a small blow that passed by his defenses. Both Yoda and Dooku survived, but each left the confrontation once again before the victor could be determined with much on their minds.\n\n\u2022 Argul\n\nWhen fierce fighting broke out on the planet Argul, Yoda traveled to the world with a number of other Jedi, to help evacuate refugees from Argul's cities. However, there were not enough transports for the Jedi to evacuate all of the Argullians, so Yoda left the planet, promising to return with more ships.\"Only the Force\"\nYoda commandeered the Sullustan task force and returned to Argul with the fleet, using it to reinforce Republic forces on the planet. The task force quickly turned the tide of the battle in the favor of the Republic, and Yoda landed with the reinforcements, via a gunship. He then congratulated the surviving Jedi on the world, for their efforts during the battle.\n\n\u2022 Bpfasshi Dark Jedi crisis\n\nEarly in 19 BBY, Yoda led a Jedi task force to confront the Dark Jedi crisis on the planet Bpfassh. A group of Bpfasshi Dark Jedi were responsible for a rampage of terror and destruction throughout the Bpfassh system and, indeed, the entire Sluis sector. The task force was able to stop the insurrection and quell the uprising.Star Wars: Rebellion Yoda then personally engaged the last of the Bpfasshi Dark Jedi, who survived the Jedi intervention and managed to escape, commandeering Jorj Cardass smuggling ship, in a duel that lasted a day and a half, before finally defeating himVision of the Future&mdash;or so it seemed. Mortally wounded, the fallen Bpfasshi Jedi made it to the swamp planet Dagobah, where he died.Tasty Taste]] At the site of the Dark Jedis death, a dark-side nexus was formed, becoming the Dark Side Cave.Heir to the Empire'\n\n\u2022 Rise of the Sith Lords\n\n\u2022 Battle of Coruscant\n\n25\nDespite these dark sojourns, Yoda largely remained on Coruscant and coordinated the war effort on behalf of the Jedi. He did, however, journey to Cato Neimoidia shortly before the Battle of Coruscant to investigate the discovery of Nute Gunrays mechno-chair.Labyrinth of Evil'\nDuring the Battle of Coruscant, Yoda again rode his kybuck into battle, to support the forces of Captain Fordo with a dazzling display of mounted lightsaber combat. He eventually sent the creature back to the Temple, and continued to fight, side by side with Mace Windu, on foot.\nduring the attack on Coruscant.]]\nDespite their efforts, the Jedi were unable to prevent the capture of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by General Grievous, though Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi later rescued him and killed Dooku in the process. With his hopes of converting his pupil back to the light dashed, Yoda set his focus on tracking down the last Sith Lord, though tensions between the Jedi High Council and the Office of the Supreme Chancellor were high.Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith novelization\nIn 19 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine appointed Anakin to the Jedi Council as his own representative. Again, the Council was hesitant about Skywalkers temperament but, in turn, acquiesced to the request. Yoda once more played a significant role in the young Jedis ascension in the order, as they denied Anakin the rank of Jedi Master. During that discussion, the clones reported that the Wookiees were under attack, and Yoda, having once been the planet's watchman, decided to venture to Kashyyyk to assist them.\n\n\u2022 Invasion of Kashyyyk\n\nYoda\n]]\nYoda was quite skilled in the technique of battle meditation and would use this to some effect during the Battle of Kashyyyk, assisting the Wookiees and clones as they fought the Separatist army.Star Wars: Republic: Hidden Enemy\nWhile Yoda was on Kashyyyk, Darth Sidious ordered the clones to execute Order 66, which meant the extermination of all Jedi. Yoda sensed his Jedi brethren being killed all over the galaxy and, coming to the only logical conclusion for so many concurrent deaths of his fellow Jedi, he suddenly realized, in one horrible instant, that the clone troopers were responsible. Worst of all, before the attack began, he felt Anakin Skywalkers ascension into Sidiouss new apprentice, Darth Vader. Despite being filled with grief, he was still able to defend himself, decapitating Commander Gree and his assistant with a single strike and stop the rest of his former troops from assassinating him. With help from the Wookiees Chewbacca and Tarfful, Yoda, like fellow Jedi Quinlan Vos, survived and was able to escape to meet with another surviving Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.\n\n\u2022 Dark revelations\n\nYoda\nYoda and Kenobi then went to the conquered Jedi Temple so they could reconfigure the emanating signal that was drawing Jedi survivors back to Coruscant into a trap. They disabled the deadly beacon after cutting through several clone troopers, and saw the Temple littered with the bodies of fallen Jedi, including younglings, who had been slaughtered with a lightsaber.\n, now in the hands of the Empire.]]\nAs Kenobi finished recalibrating the coded signal, he felt he must know who was responsible for the attack. Yoda, knowing that the revelation of Anakins turn to the dark side would cause Kenobi pain, cautioned him before his fellow Master activated the security recordings. As they watched, they learned of Palpatines Sith identity and that the Republic was now a Galactic Empire. They agreed that the two Sith Lords needed to be destroyed. Yoda would remain on Coruscant to confront the newly crowned Emperor in the Senate Building, while a deeply reluctant Kenobi would battle his former apprentice.\n\n\u2022 Duel in the Senate\n\nDarth Sidious and Yoda\nAs Sidious waited for word from his apprentice, Yoda entered the office. Quickly dispatching Sidious' guards by Force-pushing them into the wall, Yoda confronted the Sith Lord, who seemed surprised at his survival and attacked Yoda with Force lightning. Yoda quickly fought back with a Force push that sent the Sith Lord across the room and into his chair, where he fell onto the ground in a crumpled heap. As Sidious tried to flee, Yoda jumped in front of him and pulled out his lightsaber. Sidious then drew his own lightsaber, and the duel began.\nin the Grand Convocation Chamber.]]\nThe duel moved into the Senate, where the two Force users engaged in a saber duel in the Chancellors podium. The two at first stalemated each other, but Yoda ultimately started to gain the upper hand, pressuring Sidious by using his small size to easily avoid the latters strikes and to nimbly navigate through the podium, whereas Sidious was hampered by the podiums tight space. Not allowing a moments rest for Sidious, Yoda flurried around the Sith with his centuries worth of lightsaber knowledge, hitting with pristine determination to end this here and now. Eventually, Yoda dislodged the Dark Lords lightsaber from his grip and would have slain the Sith if not for a desperate bolt of Sith lightning forcing him back.Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith junior novel After retreating to the surrounding Senate pods, Sidious changed tactics and began using the Force to hurl several Senate Hoverpods at him from above, forcing Yoda to concentrate on dodging the improvised projectiles instead of getting to Sidiouss level. The Grand Master of the Jedi Order and the Dark Lord of the Sith were counterpoised.\nAs the duel progressed, during a match between the embodiments of the light and the dark, Yoda realized the Jedi had lost the war before it even started. In the last millennium, the Sith had changed and adapted, becoming a new entity; while the Jedi Order, under his leadership, spent the same time merely training to re-fight the last war. Moreso, he sensed that while he was weakening, Sidious was only growing stronger. Hence, Yoda realized that the longer the duel continued, the greater the gap between his power and Sidious would become. For while both of them were elderly avatars of the dark and light side, Yoda was ancient at nearly 900 years while Sidious, still old, stood at the beginning of his 60s. If he was to win at all, he had to end the duel, and quickly. As Sidious continued his telekinetic assault, Yoda caught one of the Senate podiums and flung it back at Sidious, who leapt out of its path to a lower Senate pod. Yoda took the opportunity to engage the distracted Dark Lord at close quarters once again, but Sidious fired a torrent of Force lightning at Yoda. The attack tore Yodas lightsaber from his hand, and the diminutive Jedi was forced to use tutaminis to withstand the Dark Lords lightning. As Sidious increased the power of his lightning and aimed his attack above Yodas defense by elevating his body, Yoda began to falter. As Sidious intensified his attack further, the Jedi Masters vision pierced the veil of the dark side, and he was able to see a glimpse of the future. What he might have seen was unclear, but Yodas vision certainly did reveal to him that, if the galaxy were ever to be free of the Sith, he had to remain alive.\nYodas newfound hope gave him the strength to resist Sidiouss might, and he quickly managed to coalesce the energy of Sidious lightning into a blue orb, slowly redirecting it back to an astounded Sidious, who was slowly being pushed back by the strength of Yodas counterattack. But just as Yoda appeared to be on the brink of succeeding, the combination of both of their powers caused the orb to explode, and the blast blew them both apart, ending the battle. Both Masters were able to grasp the edge of nearby Senate pods, with Sidious barely managing to right himself and achieve the high ground. Yoda, however, was unable to maintain his grasp, and fell to the floor of the Senate Chamber. Realizing that any chance he had to defeat Sidious was gone with his stamina exhausted and his body battered, Yoda decided to flee and escaped through several service pipes, with his small size proving advantageous in this moment, and met up with Bail Organa, who hurried him away in his speeder as Yoda mused about his failure. The two left for the asteroid colony of Polis Massa.\n\n\u2022 Exile (19 BBY&ndash;4 ABY)\n\nBail Prestor Organa]]\n, his new home.]]\nOn Polis Massa, Yoda communed with the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn, who agreed to train Yoda in secret Whill techniques he had learned after his death. He also regrouped with Kenobi, who had defeated but not killed Vader. Kenobi brought with him a badly injured Amidala, who was treated in Polis Massa. Although Amidala bore twins, Luke and Leia, she died soon afterward. Yoda decided that the babies were strong in the Force.\nWhen returning to the Sundered Heart with Bail Organa and reuniting with Obi-Wan Kenobi, he decided that Luke and Leia&mdash;the Skywalker children&mdash;should be hidden from Darth Vader and Darth Sidious in secret locations. Other than the ancient Jedi Master, only the Organas, the Lars, and Kenobi would know of their placement. He also told Obi-Wan that an old friend, Master Qui-Gon Jinn, had found a way to retain one's consciousness after death, and would teach both of them this skill. Yoda would take on a role he had not played in centuries: that of an apprentice.\nDuring the Great Jedi Purge, Yoda stowed away aboard an automated Polis Massan&ndash;registered barge that was transporting grain to starving inhabitants of the ex-Separatist world of Sluis Van. The ship briefly dropped out of hyperspace near the planet Dagobah. Undetected and unrecorded, Yoda launched his escape pod and landed on the swamp planet. He would spend his entire exile hiding on Dagobah, from the onset of the Dark Times to the early period of the Galactic Civil War.Yoda's escape pod\nYoda soon found and healed the badly wounded smuggler Jorj Cardas, who had been wounded by a survivor of the Bpfasshi Dark Jedi insurrection. After a revived Cardas left Dagobah, Yoda made his home near the Dark Side Cave, which, in addition to the massive number of lifeforms (which masked his presence in the Living Force), counteracted his presence in the light side. Yodas imprint on the Force was hidden, as was his sanctuary from the Emperor's sinister agents. Moreover, Dagobah was one of the thirty-seven planets erased from the Jedi Archives, further ensuring his anonymity.\nAt some point, he encountered the Children, a group of cannibals whose parents had been part of a Republic survey team that became stranded on the planet decades earlier. For some reason, the Children became extremely afraid of him and called him the \"Imp.\"Galaxy of Fear: The Hunger\nShortly afterward, Qu Rahn, another Jedi who survived both Order 66 and its aftermath, went to Dagobah and was taught many skills by the old master. Before the Battle of Hoth, Tash and Zak Arranda also encountered Yoda. It was during these years that the diminutive being developed a taste for rootleaf stew.\nWhen Starkiller, a clone of Darth Vaders deceased secret apprentice, traveled to Dagobah to meditate, he discovered the entrance to a cave. Before entering, Starkiller met Yoda, although he was oblivious to the diminutive creatures identity. Despite his vague comments, Yoda assured the clone that his path clearly brought him to the cave and venturing inside would yield some answers for him. After Starkiller exited the cave, Yoda told him that he had to follow his destiny, to which the clone said he would follow it to the ends of the galaxy.\nBy this time, Emperor Palpatine increased the bounty on Yoda by a further 30,000 credits.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, PS3/Xbox 360 Yoda Databank entry Due to multiple attempts at collecting the reward through fraud, the Empire had to modify the conditions so that no one else would be tempted to cheat the Empire. First, the reward was only good for a living subject. Second, a non-negotiable death penalty was attached to the bounty and would be enforced on anyone who tried to collect the reward by handing over a \"false Yoda.\" The Empire also used the fate of bounty hunter Rurrk Carivv to remind others that Imperial authorities were quite capable of telling the difference between a Jedi Master of advanced age and a dead Jawa stripped of his clothing and surgically altered, noting the smell as the first and most obvious sign of deception. Shortly thereafter, Yoda was listed one of eight of the Empires most wanted criminals, alongside Alderaanian Princess Leia Organa, former Mon Calamari senator Meena Tills, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, of which they were often issued in recruitment videos for stormtroopers and the Imperial Army.couperin9\nOne day around 0 BBY, Jorj Cardas suddenly showed up once more on Dagobah, violently demanding that Yoda put his failing health right. Yoda simply took his blaster and the beckon call from his ship and flung them into the swamp, then berated Cardas for wasting the second chance he had been given. He also told Cardas that he couldnt help him any further, since he was busy preparing for the most important training he would ever lead. Cardas became so embarrassed by his own actions that he couldnt return to his group, so he fled to Exocron, where Yoda had indicated he might receive help from the Aing-Tii monks.\nAt some point during his exile, Alliance historian Major Arhul Hextrophon discovered Yodas whereabouts and traveled to Dagobah to find him. Yoda originally intended to wipe his mind but in the end decided against it, since it was not the Jedi way to cause pain and suffering&mdash;in this case, through the loss of memory. Hextrophon was instead made to swear not to reveal his existence. He erased the records which led him to Yoda in the first place, and apart from keeping logs in his private journal, it is believed he kept his word.The Star Wars Sourcebook'\n\n\u2022 The next Skywalker\n\nYoda to Luke Skywalker\nWhen Luke Skywalker, son of Anakin Skywalker, arrived on Dagobah, Yoda met him but kept his identity to himself, acting like a primitive life form as a means to test Luke, although he did promise to lead Luke to Yoda. He also warned Luke before returning to his hut that Luke must avoid the water as there were many dangers in the swamps of Dagobah. Upon Lukes arrival at the hut, Luke expressed his irritation at his not encountering Yoda yet, causing Yoda to voice his doubts to Obi-Wan Kenobis ghost about whether training Luke was a good idea. Yoda reluctantly agreed to train him in the ways of the Force, after Luke realized the creature was Yoda and pledged to train under him, as well as Obi-Wan's reminder to Yoda that Obi-Wan himself was also reckless and impatient when he was younger. He expressed caution, though, as he sensed in Luke traits similar to his father and judged him too old for training.\nThe experienced Jedi Master expedited Luke Skywalkers Jedi training to fit in the limited time they could afford. At one point Yoda sent Luke Skywalker to fight the Dragonsnake King in order to humble the beast and casually reminisced with R2-D2 during the battle, before using the Force to help the droid avoid harm and strike the beast with electricity--this was later shown to be a ploy by the old Grandmaster to ensure the beast would be dethroned as it was too large and powerful and had unbalanced the ecosystem.Star Wars Adventures: Luke Skywalker and the Treasure of the Dragonsnakes Yoda taught Luke new ways of using the Force, such as short-term memory enhantment,Dark Force Rising and deepening Luke\u2019s telekinetic abilities. However, prior to finishing his instruction, Luke chose to leave Dagobah without completing his training in order to confront Darth Vader at Cloud City above Bespin and save his friends. Yoda and the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi attempted to convince him to stay, thinking Luke ready to face neither Vader nor the revelation to come. Skywalker promised to come back in order to complete his training. Obi-Wan was concerned about this decision, telling Yoda that Luke was their last hope. Yoda quickly reminded Kenobi that hope still remained in the person of \"another,\" namely Leia Organa, Lukes sister.\nAfterwards, Yoda reflected on the events that led to that point. Although he knew that the Jedi Council was all but gone, and that his own age meant he would soon die, he nonetheless was still a Jedi Master, and even during the Dark Times, he believed the struggle would continue, with droids and aliens such as R2-D2 and Chewbacca, respectively, fighting the Empire. He also noted that Leia Organa, one of the leaders of the Rebel Alliance, resembled her mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and noted that an imprint on the parent was always strong. However, he grew concerned regarding Luke and Vader, noting that the imprint was not always a good path, and that Luke could become an agent of evil should he follow the same path as his father. But he also noted that Luke was both strong and good-hearted, which might mean that not only would he not turn to the dark side, but also that Anakin Skywalker might be redeemed. He then proclaimed his faith in the light side and the return of the Jedi Knights.Star Wars: The Power of the Force comic\n\n\u2022 Death\n\nYoda, to Luke Skywalker, shortly before his death\n.]]\nWhen Luke returned a year later, Yoda had grown sick and weak, and knew his death was imminent. He informed Luke that his training was complete, but that his final test would be to face Darth Vader. He proceeded to confirm that Darth Vader was his true father, and scolded him for recklessly fighting Vader on Cloud City. He also told Luke that he should not underestimate Darth Sidious, and that he should pass on what he had learned, as the Force ran strong within Luke's family. With his final breaths, Yoda struggled to tell Luke his final words: \"Luke. There is another Skywalker.\"\nYoda then died and dissipated as he became one with the Force. Darth Sidious eventually discovered Yodas demise by probing Lukes mind when he was brought aboard the second Death Star, and proceeded to mock the deceased Jedi Master, while Vader reacted without any emotion at the news.Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi novelization At the celebration after the Battle of Endor, Luke would look upon the specters of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his redeemed father.\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\nDoubtlessly, Yoda was one of the most gifted Force users in the history of the Jedi Order. Aside from his mastery of the Force, his most noticeable attributes were leadership and a very long lifespan. With almost a millennium of life, Yoda was able to establish himself as the most venerated Jedi Master throughout the entire Order&mdash;a status that would remain solely his for centuries until the fall of the Republic. As the reigning Grand Master for many centuries, Yoda had essentially become the \"face\" of the Jedi. As Etain Tur-Mukan mused, \"Yoda was the Jedi Order,\" making it impossible to criticize him without sounding blasphemous.\nIronically, in this regard, Yoda had more in common with his Sith counterpart, Darth Sidious, than he realized. As Sidious was regarded as the vital and infallible leader of the Sith, so too was Master Yoda the vital and infallible leader of the Jedi Order. Thus, neither Yoda or Sidious could be criticized without their critics being automatically discredited and regarded with suspicion.\nIn 5 ABY, when Pic and Gorc were sent to kidnap Qu Rahn, Pic noticed an old silver-hilt lightsaber, which, although only Rahn knew at the time, had once belonged to Grand Master Yoda. Pic placed weapon on his belt and later used it to fight Kyle Katarn.Dark Forces: Rebel Agent Pics body was left by Katarn on the Sulon Star along with Gorcs; Kyle did not realize at the time that the tiny darksider carried a weapon which had once belonged to Master Yoda. Later, after realizing the importance of the saber, Luke Skywalker sent a group of Jedi to retrieve the lightsaber, though it was unknown if they succeeded; the weapon and Pic's body could have stayed intact on the ship, or someone else might have taken it.\nAfter his death at the age of 900, Yoda retained his individuality in the Force. As a so-called Force ghost, he would look down on Leia and the Solo twins when they were born. His teachings would become the basis for what Luke taught his New Jedi Order. Since Yoda's teachings to Luke were rushed, most teachings of the Jedi Order were lost until the New Jedi Order began to find ancient holocrons, or, in some cases, libraries like the one on Ossus.\nYodas ghost manifested on Coruscant for the birth of Jacen and Jaina.The Last Command' 1\nYodas power and wisdom impressed Luke throughout his life. Luke considered Yoda to have been wiser than himself or anyone else Luke had met.The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion'\nAs Yoda had informed Luke of the history of The Ones and their encounter with Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars when he taught the Skywalker, he contributed to the Jedi pursuit of Abeloth.Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse\n\n\u2022 Personality and traits\n\nYoda, to Whie Malreaux\non his hand.]]\nYoda was the personification of what it meant to be a Jedi and a servant of the Jedi ideals. Yoda was the best equipped to guide the Jedi order. To his students, the elfin luminary Yoda could appear as either very strict or like a grandfatherly figure, testing them to mental and physical extremes one moment and showing warmth the next. Students often strongly disagreed with him at first, but gradually came to understand his attitudes. He believed strongly in the need to heed the insights of the Unifying Force,Star Wars Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook though he rejected the theoryThe New Jedi Order: Traitor the Force was essentially \"grey.\"\nAmong his colleagues on the Jedi High Council, he was known to have a penchant for mischief and practical jokes. To all of the young Jedi, he was the humble Yoda, who offered enlightened leadership and epitomized the ideals of the Jedi Order; a grand master of that august body, he was widely known as a sage instructor.\nAlthough Yoda was a strict and firm leader, he deeply cared for the Jedi Order and the light side. The Jedi Master had the deepest commitment to the Force and the teachings thereof. Yoda respected Wookiees.Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith 3 He was willing to sacrifice a chance to win and neutralize Dooku by saving Anakin and Kenobi when Dooku unleashed an attack that would have killed them. Yoda also greatly grieved Anakin Skywalkers fall and Order 66 killing almost all Jedi, to the point of falling to his knees. He was also willing to acknowledge whenever he was proven wrong, as shown by how he humbly apologized to Jinn&mdash;when the latter proved his unique wisdom was beneficial, as he had acquired the ability to retain identity&mdash;for having doubted him and acknowledged that he was a great Jedi.Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith' 4\nDespite a body of evidence to the contrary, which included famous names such as Ulic Qel-Droma, Oss Wilum, and Revan, Yoda was largely a traditionalist in his belief that a Jedi who was seduced by the dark side of the Force would be forever condemned to walk in darkness. During the Clone Wars, however, he originally believed that no Jedi was beyond redemption and forgiveness. Even after Count Dooku betrayed the Republic and the Jedi by committing numerous atrocities as the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, Yoda once tried to persuade his former student to let go of the dark side and return to the ways of the Jedi, and very nearly succeeded in redeeming Dooku. Even as Quinlan Vos slipped further into the dark sides embrace, Yoda had faith that the disturbed young Jedi Master would find his way back to the light side of the Force; unlike Dooku, Vos vindicated Yodas belief in redemption.\nHowever, Yodas failure to redeem Dooku, as well as his inability to prevent the rise of the Galactic Empire, left the Grand Master more jaded than ever. In addition to the fall of the Republic, the Jedi Order was pushed to the brink of extinction by the fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whose fall to the dark side turned him into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Before his death, he warned Vaders son, Luke Skywalker, that \"when a person falls to the dark side, their destiny would forever be dominated by darkness.\"\nYoda spoke an unusual version of Basic. He tended to place verbs (especially auxiliaries) after the object and subject (an object-subject-verb format). An example of Yodas speech pattern: \"When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not.\"(Listen) Most agreed that this pattern of speech was convoluted, and while it seems as though others of his species (e.g. Yaddle) had the same penchant for rearranging sentences, not all of them did (e.g. Vandar Tokare). As suggested by Ben Skywalker, he purposefully chose to speak like this so that people would have to listen attentively to what he said.Fate of the Jedi: Backlash'\n]]\nYoda walked with the aid of a cane later in life, although he was capable of throwing it aside and moving nimbly while using the Force. One of his canes was a gift from the Wookiees. His rare gimer cane contained nutrients that could sustain him were he to chew on it. He also used a hoverchair for moving around the Temple quickly and more efficiently.\nAnother item unique to Master Yoda was a blissl, an instrument similar to a pan flute, which he wore around his neck while on Dagobah. During the Clone Wars, he would often make use of a kybuck given to him by a Woolwarricca princess from Kashyyyk as a gift.kybuck\nYoda also had a unique crest that adorned his quarters.\nYodas origins were secretive and he never revealed his homeworld to anyone.Star Wars: Attack of the Clones: The Ultimate Illustrated Guide'\n\n\u2022 Powers and abilities\n\nYoda and Luke Skywalker, meeting on Dagobah\nConsidered by many to be the greatest Jedi Master of the era, Yoda was one of the most skilled lightsaber duelists and users of the Force in the history of the galaxy. Yodas powers awestruck even the Dark Jedi Beldorion, who grouped him among three elite Jedi Masters, along with Thon and Nomi Sunrider, who had lived several millennia earlier than him. Beldorion considered the trio to be truly great as they were prodigiously talented in the Force, specifically in the directing of pure light-side energies. Of all the Force users in the galaxy, only Darth Sidious, perhaps the most powerful Sith Lord of all time, rivaled Yodas mastery of the Force and strength with a lightsaber.\n\n\u2022 Lightsaber training\n\n.]]\nIn addition to his immense connection to the Force, Yoda was amazingly skilled in lightsaber combat, one of the greatest duelists in history, and was widely acknowledged as being perhaps the greatest Jedi duelist and Swordmaster of his time despite being trained as a Jedi Consular. He was known to be the only Jedi who could best both Mace Windu and Count Dooku. Although he did not often participate in direct combat, Yodas impeccable swordsmanship remained as sharp as ever. In his duel with Dooku, who had became Darth Tyranus and improved his skill even further, Yoda held the upper hand throughout the majority of the fight and would have defeated him had Tyranus not fled. Testament to his unnatural experience in dueling was that Dooku under his tutelage became a swordsman of rare skill and elegance, quickly rising to surpass most Jedi apart from Windu and Yoda himself. Nearly inconceivable was the last fight the small Jedi had against the leader of the CIS, which resulted in Dooku actually landing a hit (though minor) on the master of Ataru, a feat thought basically impossible to accomplish. Another testament to Yodas immense dueling skill was that not only was he able to fight on equal footing with Darth Sidious, but he was also even able to defeat and disarm the Dark Lord, a feat that only Luke Skywalker (while empowered by the might and meditation of his family) and Mace Windu were ever able to replicate. In fact, Sidious was confused and confounded by Yodas speed and skill.Star Wars: Jedi Battles He was able to disarm Darth Sidious, who only preserved his life by throwing a huge blast of lightning Yoda had to cease his deathstrike to block with the Force, and then by shooting Yodas saber from his hand when the Grandmaster was a moment too slow while maneuvering around the Senate chamber. Overall, Yodas mastery of lightsaber combat marked him as the greatest duelist of his time. Sidious himself, after having dueled Yoda, stated his belief that the Grand Master would have \"destroyed\" Darth Vader if the young Sith had faced him rather than Kenobi on Mustafar.Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader'\nYoda received intensive training in the use of all the seven forms of lightsaber combat and had achieved full mastery and knowledge of them all and all of their stances and techniques. Known to be the best lightsaber instructor in the Temple, his complete mastery of each form was such that he was able to decide which one fitted his student the most and instruct them how to use their specialized form effectively. His most preferred style was Form IV, which he particularly specialized at, as it allowed him to compensate for his limited reach and stature. Known to be the Orders greatest master of Ataru, his technique was said to consist of the pure basics of Ataru taken to their highest possible levels. Despite his advanced age and short stature, Yoda remained an exceptionally formidable duelist, displaying amazing speed and dexterity, leaping through the air and twirling as he battered at an opponents defenses. Much of his lightsaber combat style relied on jumps and acrobatics, augmented by his mastery of Force valor. Despite the fact that Yodas primary combat specialization was Ataru, his skill in the form was such that he was capable of effectively overcoming its weaknesses with ease and demonstrated an extreme level of skill with regard to deflecting blaster bolts and could easily handle many opponents at once, evidenced by his easy victory over many clone troopers when he returned to the Jedi Temple during Order 66. In addition, Yoda at times applied his mastery of the other forms into his dueling style. He was known for having proficiently applied elements of Shii-Cho bladework and his outstanding deflection ability implied a superb level of skill in either Shien or Soresu.\nHowever, in his later years, Yoda lost a great deal of his mobility, demonstrating a pronounced limp and depending on a cane to aid him in his everyday movements. This loss of mobility was due to the fact that, in his old age, Yoda suffered from debilitating arthritis. When possible, Yoda preferred to use a hoverchair rather than walk at all. His mastery of Force valor allowed him to overcome these physical infirmities, but due to the extremely taxing nature of the ability, he was only able to utilize it for a short time before tiring. Even when he trained Luke Skywalker, however, Yoda retained enough skill to effortlessly defeating his pupil with only a stick, in spite of Skywalker being armed with a lightsaber and employing a saber throw against him--and only lost when he allowed Skywalker to seize his stick.\nMaster Yoda carried a green-bladed shoto, which, unlike most other lightsabers, possessed an ignition button that also acted as a clip. Yoda was one of the few Force-users, Jedi and Sith alike, who kept his trademark homespunStar Wars Character Encyclopedia robe on during combat, possibly because it was small enough not to hinder his movements.\nYoda was able to cave his way through a host of Spelunker probe droids, often moving faster than they could react or fire.15\nYoda fought his way to safety through a squad of clones during Order 66.\n\n\u2022 Force powers\n\nYoda, as befitting a centuries-old Jedi Grand Master, was extraordinarily powerful and skilled in the Force, one of the most powerful Force users in history&mdash;rivaling Darth Sidious&mdash;and was the greatest and strongest master of the Force among the Jedi of his time, surpassing even the potentially more powerful Anakin Skywalker, due to having far more experience in using it. Luke Skywalker considered Yodas powers to be far beyond what Darth Vader was capable of, and felt Yoda was likewise much more powerful than he was in 9 ABY. His power in the Force was described as being \"as light as the stars.\" His midi-chlorian count was also known to be the second highest in the history of the Jedi, surpassed only by the Chosen One Anakin Skywalker. His strength and mastery of the Force was great enough that he could easily defend himself against and dominate other powerful masters of the Force, as shown when he casually repelled all of Dookus Force assaults despite the increase in power and skill Dooku had acquired from turning to the dark side. Yoda was so powerful and skilled in Force combat that he could effortlessly overpower highly skilled and armed adversaries using nothing but the Force, as evidenced with Asaji Ventress. Indeed, Yoda was the only one to have ever managed to single-handedly go up against Darth Sidious in Force combat and matched the Dark Lord to a draw, although he proved incapable of defeating him as they were evenly matched. His power and skill in the Force remained tremendous even as he continued to age and lost his former great mobility. Even the Dark Lords of the Sith Darth Tyranus and Darth Sidious acknowledged his Force power and mastery, with Darth Tyranus holding his former masters strength in the Force in high enough regard that he believed that should Yoda fall to the dark side, he would be so powerful that not even Sidious would be able to stand against him. According to Luke, Yodas powers far surpassed his own and Darth Vader's.\nMaster Yoda was extremely skilled in the use of mind-related powers. He could cast mind tricks that were easily strong enough to effectively manipulate strong-willed individuals, such as Captain Typho, and could easily delve deep into the minds of others to decipher their thoughts with great precision. Yoda's telepathic capabilities also allowed him to manipulate the memories of his targets.\nYoda was also extraordinarily skilled in telekinesis. He demonstrated on one occasion the ability to easily telekinetically lift and carry an X-wing, and during the Battle of Coruscant, he caused a pair of C-9979 landing craft to collide with each other on two separate occasions. In their duel on Geonosis, Yoda easily deflected every telekinetic assault from Darth Tyranus, who was a former Temple instructor of telekinesis. Yoda was able to catch Darth Sidious off guard with a Force-push that blasted Sidious away from him and later managed to stop a Senate Hoverpod that Sidious hurled at him from above, which he then proceeded to use the Force to throw back at him, an all the more impressive feat due to the fact that the pod was thrown upwards against gravity. He even could effortlessly toy with the very powerful Asajj Ventress, who was known to have defeated Kit Fisto and could hold her own against the likes of Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker, using only telekinesis: he was able to easily send her flying, stop her strike in midair, and even go as far as to casually disarm her of her lightsabers with a simple gesture. A master practitioner of the Force Push and Force Wave powers, Yoda used these abilities in conjunction with Mace Windu to blast away dozens of battle droids simultaneously during the Battle of Coruscant and also to raise an expansive force of Separatist battle droids into the air, ensuring that they would collide into the incoming airborne Separatist attack ships, which eliminated the two attack forces in one seamless stroke. Master Yoda was also adept at the saber throw, as demonstrated in his return to the Jedi Temple during the Great Jedi Purge.\nYoda also displayed an astounding level of mastery in the use of the defensive power of Tutaminis, using it during his duel with Darth Tyranus to effortlessly absorb and redirect the Sith Lords Force lightning with no effort. Despite being nearly overwhelmed by its power, Yoda was ultimately able to absorb Sidiouss lightning, eventually managing to coalesce the energy of the Dark Lords Force lightning into a blue orb between the two of them, which slowly redirected the lightning back onto an astounded Sidious and caused him to slowly reel backwards with the strength of Yodas counterattack before the combination of both of their Force powers blasted the two of them apart. Yoda also was able to use Force Valor to improve his physical attributes with the Force, and even after his exile was so strong in the Force that he was able to resist old age long enough to train Luke.The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook Yoda could, with great effort, use the Force to stifle and quash the efforts of his enemies to draw on the Force.Revenge of the Sith Star Wars Miniatures However, despite his great power and skill as a warrior, Yoda was known to strongly dislike combat in general, and was even a bit disdainful of the idea that \"greatness\" could be achieved through martial prowess.\noverpowering Force lightning with his bare hands.]]\nMaster Yoda was able to foresee events with a great clarity, rivaling even that of Darth Sidious. In addition, Yoda had extremely strong Force senses, as he was able to quickly sense the deaths of almost all members of the Jedi Order and identify each one, while also sensing that Anakin Skywalker had turned to the dark side even all the way from Kashyyyk. Due to his training with Qui-Gon Jinn, Yoda acquired the power to retain his identity after becoming one with the Force. He even was able to foresee that Luke would need to know about Mortis, an eventuality that came to pass more than forty years after the Jedi did. He was also able to ponder matters of the dark and light sides of the Force with unparalleled clarity that surpassed all other Jedi of his time, even Mace Windu. He was the most skilled user of Force empathy among the Jedi, exceeding even the renowned empathic abilities of Depa Billaba.Power of the Jedi Sourcebook He could sense intense feelings coming from others even from other planets, as he was able to sense the immense pain Anakin felt from the death of his mother, as well as hear the voice of Jinns spirit, while the latter was on Tatooine even though Yoda was on Coruscant and meditating. He also easily sensed the tension between Kenobi and Anakin when they pursued Dooku and was able to identify the cause as Padm\u00e9s fall from an LAAT gunship. Yoda could see things far off, and had watched Luke through the Force for a long time. Supposedly, he had a Force technique to guide humankind to be more moral.Dark Empire 1 Yoda could enhance his memory and taught this power to Luke. He could also sometimes look through the eyes of other Jedi. Yoda could stun his foes, change the environment to try to block their attacks, quash others Force powers and make those not sensitive to the Force able to use it to a limited extent, such as when his healing of Jorj Cardas made the man able to use the Force to a limited extent.\nYoda was also quite proficient in the valued Force technique Battle Meditation, having even been able to determine the outcome of battles by lifting the morale of thousands of companions while simultaneously dampening the spirits of thousands of his opponents, wielding armies with the same ease as sabers. Yoda could enter a trance state, then when he emerged his ability to use the Force briefly was more focused. Moreover was able to summon the force power of Emerald Lightning, such as when he fought Darth Sidious,Star Wars The Clone Wars: Who are the Jedi? and when he seeded it into a dark mirror of himself. In addition, Yoda could use Force harmony to defend himself from Dark powers and even shatter powers already in effect\u2014this ability became more effective if Yoda was able to join his power with that of other Jedi. Yoda was believed by Luke to have, in 3 ABY, used the Force to disable the sensors of the young Jedis ship, then used the Force to guide the craft to where it needed to be. He was also capable of using it to inspire great amounts of hope while simultaneously eliminating feelings of doubt and despair from the spirit of others with a single touch, as he did to saturate Palleus Chuff with feelings of hope and potential mission success while also completely dispersing his feelings of doubt and despair. Yoda was very proficient in the use of the Force to preserve life, having learned the use of many powers to heal himself and others, and even keeping himself alive though sheer willpower until he trained Luke Skywalker, though just before he allowed himself to pass into the Force he admitted he was at the end of his strength due to the great power required for such a feat. Upon his death, Yodas body vanished as he became a Force ghost.\nHowever, despite his advanced skill and power in the Force, he was only able to lift five of the seven Muntuur stones while in meditation once he passed his seven hundredth year. Moreover, Yoda was aware of several Sith spells\u2014though he did not use them, and understood the Dark Side powers to kill with a touch or take total control over a victim, though again he is not known to actually used these Dark Side powers. Yoda contemplated using the dark side to remove all memory of himself from a man, but ultimately decided that to do so would be wrong, and instead did what he felt the Force was guiding him to do and spared the historian.\n\n\u2022 Other abilities\n\nUnlike most other Jedi of his era, Master Yoda knew how to create Jedi holocrons. The diminutive Jedi Master created at least one holocron, through which he discussed various aspects of the Jedi Code. This particular holocron was rescued by Jax Pavan during Vaders attack on the Jedi Temple.\nYoda was known for being the wisest and smartest Jedi of his time. He was an exceptional strategist, being a great contributor to the highest level of Jedi strategy, and was also an exceptional diplomat comparable with the likes of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu. As such, many of the sage's missions during the Clone Wars were diplomatic in nature, and he prevented many battles from occurring, though some, as in the case of his missions to Vjun and Rugosa, ultimately descended into battle. Yoda later demonstrated his strategical aptitude by choosing Dagobah as his place of exile, using the strong dark-side presence around the cave representing the dark side to block the senses of Sidious and Vader. Yoda also came up with a plan to evade CIS fire when his ship was ambushed, ordering all escape pods to be launched so the droids would not know which one he was in. Despite at times offering help to others, he was able to avoid any confrontation with the Empire during his exile.\nYoda was a very capable leader, as Mace Windu passed on the mantle of the Master of the Order to him, and he also at times led many attacks during the Clone Wars to victory. He also had enough strength to carry a box with a gigantic chaingun, this weapon he used to destroy a droid army in order to save a planet. He was confidant that he could destroy the droid attack on the Wookiees.Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith 2 Sometime during his exile, he was able to craft a new lightsaber.Star Wars: The Card Game'\nAlthough Yoda usually had his soldiers handle the piloting, when required to personally pilot a ship, he proved surprisingly capable, as evidenced when he was forced to travel alone to Dagobah: he single-handedly flew a starfighter without fail, avoiding any damage while piloting it. He could even enhance his piloting skills using the Force, allowing him to safely reach the planet where the Force Priestesses were when Artoo and the instruments on the ship malfunctioned while in a small, glowing, golden nebula.\nYoda was perceptive with his physical senses as well as the Force, as shown when he was able to catch Luke Skywalker cheating during exercises. By his own admission, food Yoda prepared often tasted foul. However, Skywalker felt the old master's stews tasted good.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\n.]]\n.]]\nYoda was voiced by Muppeteer Frank Oz in the Star Wars films. In the original trilogy and The Phantom Menace, he was realized as a puppet (controlled by Oz). Yodas appearance was originally designed by British makeup artist Stuart Freeborn, who based Yodas face partly on his own and partly on Albert Einsteins. In The Phantom Menace the actor Warwick Davis played Yoda for scenes where the character was required to walk. Rendered with computer animation in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, Yoda appeared in ways not previously possible, including his participation in elaborate fight scenes. However, Yodas first appearance as a completely CG-rendered image was in The Phantom Menace, at the close of the film where he talks with Obi-Wan about his and Anakin's futures.\nFor the radio dramatizations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, he was voiced by veteran character actor John Lithgow. Tom Kane provided Yodas voice for both the Clone Wars animated series and The Clone Wars 3D series, as well as many video-game incarnations: Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, Star Wars: Super Bombad Racing, Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, Star Wars: Battlefront, Star Wars: Battlefront II, Star Wars: Republic Commando and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'.\nAlong with a few substitute voice actors in the original trilogy, but from the second one onwards, Yoda is dubbed in Japanese by the late Ichir\u014d Nagai. By this proxy along with his and Darth Vaders appearance in Soulcalibur IV, Nagai also provided Yodas voice in the Japanese version of the game.\nThe depiction of the number of Yodas toes is inconsistent between different films, alternately numbering three, four and five toes. Leland Chee, keeper of the Holocron continuity database, has stated that Yoda canonically has four toes&mdash;three in the front and one in the back. For more, see the article on Yoda's species.\nYodas popularity is such that the comedy musician \"Weird Al\" Yankovic parodied the song \"Lola\" with a version called \"Yoda,\" included on the album Dare to Be Stupid (1985). More recently, the Great Luke Ski parodied the song \"YMCA\" by the Village People with a version called \"Y.O.D.A.\" included on the albums Fanboys n Da Hood (1996) and Carpe Dementia (1999).\nProducer/director Mel Brooks lampooned Yoda in his 1987 movie Spaceballs. Brooks portrayed a diminutive character named Yogurt, who specialized in manipulating a magical energy known as the Schwartz.\nYoda also made a cameo in It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, voiced by Eric Jacobson. Jacobson took over many of Frank Oz's Muppet roles.\nYoda also appears in a hip-hop Yoda music video that can be accessed via the Revenge of the Sith DVD when you go to the Options menu, highlight the THX logo, press 11, wait for the pause, press 3, wait for the pause, and finally press 8.\nTo get the animation team back in shape for their work on Episode III, Rob Coleman and his team replaced the footage of the Episode I Yoda puppet with their Episode III digital model as a test to see how far they could push his usual performance boundaries. This footage was released on the DVD, where it can be seen as part of \"The Chosen One\" featurette on Disc 2 of Revenge of the Sith. The footage has since appeared in the Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, replacing the puppet Yoda.\nOriginal concept art showed Yoda as blue instead of the green that he ended up being, and he is depicted as blue in The Empire Strikes Back novelization (published before the film of The Empire Strikes Back) . In Marvels Star Wars' (1977) 42, Yoda also seems to be tinier than in his normal appearance.\nIn some foreign dubs of the films, Yoda's bizarre manner of speaking has not been translated.\nIn Before the Storm, Luke Skywalker tells Han Solo that when he first met Yoda, he was a hermit on Dagobah for a hundred years or more. The prequel trilogy's storyline, created several years later, shows that Yoda was on Dagobah for no more than 22 years when Luke first met him.\nHeir to the Empire and Vision of the Future describe how Yoda followed a Dark Jedi from Bpfassh to Dagobah and killed him on the planet. After the Revenge of the Sith novelization (which hints that Yoda had never been on Dagobah before his exile) was published, it has been suggested the battle occurred shortly after the exile. In Star Wars Insider 98 Leland Chee wrote that the location of the battle is no longer considered part of continuity, but that it is possible that a mortally wounded Dark Jedi died on the planet after having fought Yoda elsewhere. However, this has not been confirmed.\nYoda received an updated character model to look more accurate to his Revenge of the Sith appearance for The Clone Wars: Season Five.\nIn the ride Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, Yoda was one of the characters helping the StarSpeeder 1000 pilot safely deliver a Rebel spy to the Rebel Alliance. However, as he was not known to have interacted with the Rebel Alliance during this time, it is unknown whether this is canon.\nIn November 2013, a deleted scene for Return of the Jedi was found on the laserdisc edition of the film. The scene, taking place on Yodas deathbed and presumably occurring when Luke learns Vader was indeed his father, had him revealing that Obi-Wan Kenobi would have told Luke about his paternal relation to Vader had Yoda let him, making clear that Yoda was largely the reason Kenobi hid the truth from Luke.\nYodas signature in The Jedi Path' differs from that of the 1980 Yoda postcard made by Frank Oz.\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\nWilliam Shakespeares The Jedi Doth Return: Star Wars Part the Sixth\nOfficial non-canon Star Wars works generally still portrayed Yoda as a wise and skilled Jedi Master, but often played up his more humorous traits.\nIn Jeffrey Browns Jedi Academy books, Yoda is a top instructor at the Jedi academy on Coruscant, but not the academys principal. Approximately 700 years old, he provides students with important training on the deeper aspects of the Force, but sometimes says things that are humorous or downright strange. He almost always talks backwards and laughs a lot. Roan Novachez, a student recruited to the academy at a relatively late age, was surprised by Yoda's appearance and nature and initially suspected that Yoda was teaching instead of being a full-time Jedi Knight because he was going kind of senile. Later in the series, Yoda became the personal Jedi Master to the Zabrak Padawan Cyrus.\nIn William Shakespeare's The Empire Striketh Back: Star Wars Part the Fifth and William Shakespeare's The Jedi Doth Return: Star Wars Part the Sixth, Yoda is the only character to speak entirely in haiku.\nLEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles features Yoda and focuses on events seen in the prequel era.\n\n\u2022 Clone Wars: Infinities: What if the Father never rescued Anakin from the dark side?\n\nAfter Anakin fell under the influence of the Son from Mortis, they both returned to the regular plane of the universe. Both Yoda and Palpatine sensed their arrival upon Coruscant. Because of this both Yoda and Palpatine called a temporary truce to stop Anakin, but Anakin proved too powerful for either of them and defeated them with relative ease. He then became even more powerful in the process, and proceeded to create a Force hurricane in the Senate building.Star Wars: The Clone Wars Magazine 7\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nCrucible]] Crucible (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\nJedi Academy]]\n\u2022 Menace of the Sith\n\n\u2022 Attack of the Jedi\n\n\u2022 Escape from the Jedi Temple\n\n\u2022 Race for the Holocrons\n\n\u2022 Jedi Academy: Return of the Padawan\n\n\u2022 Raid on Coruscant\n\n\u2022 Clash of the Skywalkers\n\n\u2022 Jedi Academy: The Phantom Bully\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Keeping the Peace\n\nLuke Skywalker]]\nMace Windu]]\n\n\u2022 Non-canon sources\n\n\u2022 Return of the Ewok\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Dark Side\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Yoda\n\n\u2022 Yoda\n\n\u2022",

It would be the first major combat of the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]], as well as the first major battle the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] would fight in years.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Quote|More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed.|Yoda|<ref name=\"AotC\" />}}\nIn [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] was in the midst of a crisis.

The Republic [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] planned to meet that year to discuss the [[Military Creation Act/Legends|Military Creation Act]]. Three months before the vote, angry showdowns occurred between planets' inhabitants and among the two opposing governments while the [[Refugee Relief Movement/Legends|Refugee Relief Movement]] tried to help where possible.<ref name=\"NEC\" />\n\nThe day of the vote, [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] arrived on Coruscant to vote against the Act, but faced an [[Plot to assassinate Senator Amidala|assassination attempt]]. She was then assigned Jedi protectors&mdash;[[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his youthful [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]. Kenobi followed the trail of the [[Mk I Saberdart|toxic dart]] which [[Death/Legends|ended the life]] of the [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] while Skywalker escorted the Senator back to Naboo.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nKenobi followed the tip from his friend [[Dexter Jettster/Legends|Dexter Jettster]] to the planet [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]], which had been erased from the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|Jedi Archives]] by forces unknown. There he discovered that [[32 BBY/Legends|ten years earlier]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Sifo-Dyas/Legends|Sifo-Dyas]] had placed an order for a [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone trooper]] [[Army/Legends|army]]. During the tour, he met the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]]. Kenobi reported back to the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] and decided to pursue Fett, suspecting that he was involved in the assassination attempt. They battled on a landing platform, and Kenobi was able to plant a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing beacon]] on [[Slave I/Legends|Fett's ship]].<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nOn his way to Geonosis, Dooku encoded a message to [[General/Legends|General]] [[Sev'rance Tann/Legends|Sev'rance Tann]] telling her he foresaw a great battle was about to happen.

His ship barely avoided a [[Homing torpedo/Legends|homing torpedo]], and he landed on the surface. He snuck into a facility and watched a meeting of [[Separatist Council/Legends|Separatist leadership]], where it was revealed that [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]] of the Trade Federation was behind Amidala's assassination attempt. Kenobi reported back to the Jedi Council but was captured by [[Droideka/Legends|destroyer droids]]. His signal was rerouted through Amidala's [[H-type Nubian yacht/Legends|ship]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], as she and Skywalker had traveled there in a [[Mission to rescue Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|failed attempt]] to rescue [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|his mother]]. Meanwhile, Dooku met with the captive Kenobi to try to turn him to his side, even revealing that the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|events]] on Naboo years prior had in fact been orchestrated by a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] named [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]], and also strongly insinuated that Sidious was [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|one of the high ranking officials]] of the Republic's government. Kenobi refused, and Dooku suggested it would be difficult for him to secure his release.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nSkywalker and Amidala traveled to Geonosis to rescue Kenobi but were captured in the [[Geonosis droid factories/Legends|Geonosis droid foundries]]. The two were sentenced to death in the [[Petranaki arena]] along with Kenobi. When Kenobi enquired them as to why they were present, Skywalker explained Amidala's idea to rescue him, with Kenobi sarcastically congratulating them for the failed objective. They narrowly escaped their executions, which involved an [[Acklay/Legends|acklay]], a [[Nexu/Legends|nexu]], and a [[Reek/Legends|reek]].<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nIn response to Kenobi's report about the Separatists' conspiracy, the Galactic Senate, at the suggestion of [[Junior Representative/Legends|Representative]] [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]], granted Supreme Chancellor Palpatine \"emergency powers\" to deal with the crisis.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nJedi [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] brought the secret clone trooper [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|army]] into use, and sent them to Geonosis right behind a Jedi strike force.<ref name=\"AotC\" /> The rapid nature of the deployment off Kamino left \"[[Cuy'val Dar]]\" sergeants such as [[Kal Skirata]] reeling at waking up to discover the commando squads they had trained gone.<ref name=\"Triple Zero\" />\n\n==The battle==\n===Penetrating the defenses===\n{{Quote|You call this a diplomatic solution?''\"<br />\"''No, I call it aggressive negotiations.|Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala|audio=AggressiveNegotiations-AOTC.ogg|<ref name=\"AotC\" />}}\nA [[Jedi assault team/Legends|group of 200 Jedi]],<ref name=\"TEA\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> led by Jedi Masters [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]], [[Coleman Trebor/Legends|Coleman Trebor]], [[Eeth Koth/Legends|Eeth Koth]], [[Kit Fisto/Legends|Kit Fisto]], [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]], [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]], [[Even Piell/Legends|Even Piell]], [[Luminara Unduli/Legends|Luminara Unduli]] and [[Ki-Adi-Mundi/Legends|Ki-Adi-Mundi]] were sent to Geonosis by the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi and investigate reports that Separatists were constructing an army on Geonosis.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\n[[File:Jedi_Squadron.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A squadron of Delta-7 ''Aethersprite''-class light interceptor, led by Mace Windu and Luminara Unduli, approach Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.]]\nUpon entering the system, the fleet of [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor/Legends|Jedi starfighters]] were fired upon by [[Anti-orbital cannon]]s, taking several casualties. Mace Windu and Luminara Unduli slipped past the firing range of the cannons and piloted [[TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank/Legends|TX-130S fighter tanks]], and employed communications jamming to stop any CIS forces from calling for reinforcements. They set off to disable the orbital cannons. The droid defenses, consisting of [[Ground Armored Tank|GATs]], [[IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank/Legends|Hailfire droids]], and [[Single Trooper Aerial Platform/Legends|STAPs]], attempted to hold them off, but were destroyed by the Jedi. The power nodes were destroyed, causing the cannons to explode.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars game\" />\n\nThe last cannon, however, was housed in a [[Geonosian/Legends|Geonosian]] base. Windu set out on foot to disable the cannon. He penetrated the droid defenses and destroyed the last power nodes with his [[Mace Windu's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. With the orbital defenses disabled, a landing zone had to be made. The Jedi strike team landed in a captured Confederate outpost and moved toward the arena in a convoy of [[Republic Troop Transport/Legends|RTTs]]. Windu and Unduli cleared the way in their tanks. They reached the perimeter of the arena, where they destroyed tunnel catacombs deploying [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]]. The Jedi deployed into the arena quietly.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars game\" />\n\nAlso around this time, the [[Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ship/Legends|''Acclamator''-class assault ship]] [[Aken (Acclamator-class)|''Aken'']] was traveling to Geonosis through its [[Asteroid field/Legends|asteroid belt]]. ''Aken'' was escorted by Jedi starfighters lead by [[Adi Gallia/Legends|Adi Gallia]], who had traveled from [[Battle of Nod Kartha|Nod Kartha]], and [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]]. After they were spotted by [[Vulture-class starfighter/Legends|droid starfighters]], the Jedi had to defend the ''Aken'' from two [[C-9979 landing craft/Legends|C-9979 landing craft]] and two [[Lupus-class missile frigate|Trade Federation Missile Frigates]] that appeared behind them along with [[Nantex-class territorial defense starfighter/Legends|Geonosian starfighters]] from the surface. The Separatist forces pushed the Republic group forward until the ''Aken'' reached the edge of the [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] ring. There, a [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]] of Missile Frigates arrived to trap them. Gallia led the starfighters and destroyed a pair of the [[Frigate/Legends|frigates]] in their line. This allowed the ''Aken'' to escape and eventually reach the surface of Geonosis.<ref name=\"JSF\" /> Eventually, the rest of the ''Acclamator''-class Assault ships penetrated the atmosphere, and proceeded to make pre-emptive strikes against the Geonosian beak-wing facilities, which resulted in the few fighters remaining unable to make headway against the Republic's orbital blockade.<ref name=\"ITW:AOTC\" />\n\n[[Republic Strategic Command]], including the [[Zilkin/Legends|Zilkin]] [[Meebur Gascon/Legends|Meebur Gascon]], was involved in planning the battle and analyzing maps to direct Republic forces.<ref name=\"TCW:SW\" /> [[Gaba-18 airspeeder]]s provided [[Scout/Legends|reconnaissance]].<ref name=\"TNEGTVAV\" /> [[V-19 Torrent starfighter/Legends|V-19 Torrent starfighter prototypes]] also fought in the battle.<ref name=\"V-19 db\" />\n\n===Arena battle===\n{{Expandsect}}\n{{Quote|This party's over.|Mace Windu to Dooku and the Separatist leadership|<ref name=\"AotC\" />}}\n[[File:JediCircle.jpg|thumb|right|230x230px|Mace Windu and the remains of his strike team.]]\nThe three captives, Skywalker, Amidala and Kenobi managed to avoid the beasts that had been set upon them long enough for Master Windu's rescue mission team to arrive. However, Count Dooku revealed the Separatist's new secret battle droid army, and a heated battle took place.<ref name=\"AotC\" /> At one point in the battle, the Padawan [[Tu'ala]], taking after her [[Zuth|master]], sacrificed herself to save Anakin Skywalker from a Geonosian soldier.<ref name=\"Lesson\">{{Tales|14|The Lesson (Star Wars Tales)}}</ref>\n\nThough outnumbered, the Jedi fought to the end. As the Jedi appeared throughout the arena, many Geonosians fled the arena.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nIt was during the heated battle that followed that bounty hunter Jango Fett attempted to fight and kill the legendary [[Korun/Legends|Korun]] Jedi Master, Mace Windu. However, during the fight, the reek nearly trampled Fett and damaged his jet pack. After killing the reek, Fett was charged by Mace Windu; at the last second the Mandalorian attempted to activate his [[Jetpack/Legends|jetpack]], but failed. The Jedi closed in on Fett, initially slashing his left hand and cutting it off before decapitating the infamous bounty hunter. His battered helmet was soon found by his \"son\" [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]. However, Dooku's forces held the upper hand. [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] had accidentally lost his head in a droid factory, and his head was attached to a battle droid's body, while his own body walked onto the assembly line and had a battle droid's head attached in turn. Both incarnations of C-3PO were defeated in the arena and were re-attached by [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]]. Eventually, Dooku signaled for a cessation of the fight. He offered the chance to surrender, but Windu refused, saying the Jedi would not become hostages. Dooku then remorsefully signaled the surrounding droids to execute the Jedi.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nMeanwhile, huge Republic assault ships penetrated the upper atmosphere and dropped a fleet of [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/Legends|gunships]], carrying thousands of clone troopers and dozens of [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer/Legends|AT-TEs]] as well as [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] Yoda, to the surface. By the time the fleet reached the arena, the Jedi had already suffered heavy casualties; all but just over 20 had been killed.<ref name=\"AOTC novel 331\">{{PageNumber}} [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'' novelization]], p. 331</ref> Yoda ordered the clones to form a perimeter around the survivors as they evacuated.

After having escorted the ''Aken'' to the surface of Geonosis, Master Gallia and Siri Tachi led several LAAT/i gunships at their command to deploy troopers near the power plant. The two Jedi defended the clones on the ground and in the air from Separatist forces which included battle droids, [[Armored Assault Tank/Legends|Armored Assault Tanks]], and droid starfighters. Along the way, Gallia had the gunships destroy a nearby [[Core ship/Legends|Trade Federation Core Ship]]. Clone troopers eventually reached the power plant and set up explosives inside it. After the plant was detonated by the clones, Adi Gallia and Siri Tachi took to space to prevent Separatist transports from escaping.<ref name=\"JSF\" />\n\nAfter the rescue of the Jedi, the droid and clone armies engaged one another in a complex series of engagements on a number of different fronts. The Republic army landed in twelve ''Acclamator''-class assault ships,<ref name=\"ITW:AOTC\" /> off-loading infantry, armored vehicles, artillery, and air support. The Separatist army consisted of droid infantry of varying strength and larger droid-controlled vehicles.\n\n[[File:Drop_Zone_EaW.png|thumb|right|250px|The drop zone for the clone army at the battle.]]\n\nThe Battle of Geonosis was primarily a ground campaign. However, the Republic's crucial use of aerial bombardment of the Separatists' fighter craft allowed the Republic's gunships to have air superiority throughout much of the battle, giving the clone forces a crucial advantage. And although the clone troopers were vastly outnumbered by droids, the droids were heavily exposed to attacks from the air by Republic gunships. The Republic gunships were instrumental in clearing away the Hailfire droids and allowing the AT-TEs to establish superiority on the battlefield, although the Hailfires were able to shoot down a number of LAATs, and a few were destroyed by lucky shots from laser emplacements.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nClone trooper [[CT-1226]]'s [[Regiment/Legends|regiment]] was deployed near the arena. A wave of droids headed toward the force. One of the Republic walkers launched a projectile which created a crater, and CT-1226 fell into it. A Hailfire droid passed over his head. A [[B2-HA super battle droid/Legends|B2-HA series super battle droid]] swatted aside B1 battle droids to target one of the walkers. CT-1226 was able to target the B2's heat exchangers, and a missile the droid launched hit a Hailfire instead. CT-1226 disabled the B2 with an [[Electromagnetic pulse grenade/Legends|electromagnetic pulse grenade]] and destroyed the droid with his blaster. The clone was then helped inside the walker as it plowed through the hole in the droid's defensive formation CT-1226 had formed.<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\nSeparatist General Sev'rance Tann was ordered to clear the way for Count Dooku. Along with a force of [[B2-series super battle droid/Legends|B2 super battle droids]], she proceeded along a canyon where Confederacy forces engaged Republic forces. Tann took control of surviving units, including [[B2-series super battle droid/Legends|Mortar Super Battle Droids]], [[B2-series super battle droid/Legends|Repeater super battle droids]], [[DSD1 dwarf spider droid/Legends|heavy dwarf spider droids]] to battle [[Clone Scout Walker]]s and [[Clone Personal Walker]]s, and OG-9 spider droids to duel AT-TEs. At least one [[Blurrg trooper]] fought in those skirmishes. A trooper kept Tann updated with Count Dooku's status. Near the end of the canyon, Tann dueled and defeated three [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]. When Dooku arrived at the end of the canyon, he congratulated her for her efforts.<ref name=\"GB:CC\" />\n\n[[File:Clone_Army_Charge.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Jedi Knights lead the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic into the Battle of Geonosis.]]\nRepublic reconnaissance troopers mounted their [[74-Z speeder bike/Legends|speeder bikes]] and raced across the battlefield, gathering vital information about enemy activity. Elsewhere, Geonosian-trained acklays and nexus devoured unfortunate clone troopers.<ref name=\"NEC\" /> A group of the airborne infantry, including [[Clone battalion commander|Battalion Commander]] [[CRC-09/571]], led the frontal assault on the Separatist Core Ships.<ref name=\"Shatterpoint\" /> Jedi Master Mace Windu, who was fighting on the ground, made his way to a LAAT/i and used it to destroy several [[Hardcell-class interstellar transport/Legends|''Hardcell''-class interstellar transports]] before landing and defending in a TX-130 ''Saber''-class fighter tank [[Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery|SPHA]] guns bringing down Core Ships. In this way, another three Core Ships were taken down, before Windu was informed that contact with Master Yoda had been lost. Windu raced off to find the Grand Master but was intercepted by a trio of Dooku's [[Sith acolyte/Legends|Sith Acolytes]] piloting [[Sith Enforcer|Enforcer]] hovertanks. Windu was able to defeat the trio.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars game\" />\n\nHaving beaten the droid army into retreat, Yoda noted that much of the [[Confederate Navy/Legends|Confederate Navy]] was still grounded receiving shipments of droids when the Republic attacked. Lightly armored and vulnerable Techno Union starships attempted to withdraw immediately, but many were destroyed in the first wave of attacks from the Republic gunships. The Jedi Master now ordered the army's [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] to attempt to take down as many of the heavily armored Trade Federation Core Ships as possible,<ref name=\"AotC\" /> as they each held millions of deadly battle droids, and managed to bring down at least one.\n\nDespite taking control of the surface of the planet, the Republic was unable to capture the Separatist leadership and stop the war before it began, and most of the Confederacy's battle droids and heavy equipment escaped aboard Core Ships.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\n[[File:SPHAT-concentratedfire.png|thumb|right|220px|SPHA-Ts concentrate fire on a fleeing ''Lucrehulk''-class Core Ship.]]\nMeanwhile, Jedi Master [[Echuu Shen-Jon]] and a team of other Jedi, including Plo Koon, destroyed several Core Ships and Techno Union vessels. They received reinforcements in the form of 10 [[Energy pummel/Legends|GAR Energy Pummels]] carried aboard [[AA-9 Coruscant freighter/Legends|AA-9 freighters]] while a nearby [[Republic Starship]] and [[Gunship Bomber]]s engaged targets of opportunity. [[Corporate Alliance Artillery]] Regulars were among the Separatist forces. The Jedi team then set off to pursue Count Dooku. However, they were delayed by Sev'rance Tann, who killed [[Stam Reath]], Echuu's apprentice, angering Shen-Jon. Tann then escaped.<ref name=\"GB:CC\" />\n\nIn the midst of battle, the Republic's [[Hawkbat Battalion]] was ordered to march directly into the line of fire of a column of [[OG-9 homing spider droid/Legends|spider droids]]. The battalion was almost completely annihilated, but [[Clone Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Deviss/Legends|Deviss]], leader of [[K Company]], stayed behind in a shallow crater to tend to two critically injured troopers at great personal risk. Surrounded by spider droids, he defended their position for three hours until the [[casevac]] team arrived. His heroic acts had not been in vain, as the two men under his command were rescued.<ref name=\"GttGAR\" />\n\nElsewhere, [[Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando|ARC trooper]] [[Jangotat]], previously having studied power cell recharge cycles, recognized when a Hailfire droid was about to enter a reflux pattern. The whine of the droid's capacitor was barely audible, but CT-96/298 leapt from cover and eliminated the Hailfire before it could explode, thus saving the lives of five of his cohorts.<ref name=\"TCD\">''[[The Cestus Deception]]''</ref>\n\nDeep within the [[Geonosian catacombs/Legends|Geonosian catacombs]], the Separatist [[Kaleesh/Legends|Kaleesh]]/[[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] General [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] had his first combat deployment during the battle. He killed Master [[Ur-Sema Du]] and a battalion of clone troopers with an [[Electrostaff/Legends|electrostaff]], claiming the Jedi's lightsaber as part of what would soon be his gruesome \"collection.\"<ref name=\"US:Grievous\" />\n\nLater, above a crevasse, the [[Clone commando/Legends|Republic Commando]] squad [[Theta Squad]] rappelled in and placed charges on a Geonosian door, while [[Delta Squad/Legends|Delta Squad]] held off OG-9 homing spider droids nearby. After the door was blown, Theta and Delta entered the Geonosian caverns and split up. Heading for a droid foundry, Theta squad leader [[Taler (clone commando)|Taler]] ordered [[Darman Skirata|Darman]] to stay behind and hold a position while the rest moved forward. 1136, or Darman, lost contact with his squad and pulled out. He was the only survivor of Theta.<ref name=\"Hard Contact\" />\n\nDelta Squad managed to kill Geonosian Separatist General [[Sun Fac/Legends|Sun Fac]] as he attempted to flee the planet in his personal Geonosian fighter. They also spotted General Grievous's [[Soulless One/Legends|''Soulless One'']]. The acquisition of the codes allowed the Republic artillery and fleet to take down the rest of the CIS fleet. Along the way, Delta Squad also eliminated significant numbers of droids, Geonosian warriors, and an anti-aircraft turret.<ref name=\"SW:RC\" />\n\nA LAAT/i gunship deployed the four members of Delta Squad into a canyon relatively close the Core Ship access way. They proceeded into the canyon, and fought through a series of ambushes. They finally reached the entrance to the Core Ship, but they were unable to penetrate the shield, so their [[Advisor/Legends|Clone advisor]], [[01/425]], ordered them to blast through a rock wall to reach a nearby exit. [[Boss (clone commando)|Boss]] led his three commandos towards the second door, and the defending droids were destroyed in short order.<ref name=\"SW:RC\" />\n\nSuddenly, however, an [[A-DSD advanced dwarf spider droid]] came through a different doorway, and began firing its cannons at the stranded squad. After several intense minutes, the droid was blown up, and a gunship blasted the shield protecting the Core Ship's entryway, allowing access for Delta Squad.<ref name=\"SW:RC\" />\n\n[[File:CoreShipRaid-RC.jpg|thumb|left|B2 Battle Droids on standby in the Core Ship.]]\nThe squad split up, tasked with sabotaging various crucial systems. Boss stormed through the B2 battle droid storage racks, rapidly finishing off any of them that were activated. Boss found Sev in a corridor just before three destroyer droids rolled by, but they easily destroyed them using EC detonators, proceeding to save Scorch and Fixer, who were under heavy fire. Now together Delta Squad encountered a [[battle droid dispenser]], then several [[Geonosian elite/Legends|Geonosian elites]] and a second Advanced dwarf spider droid. Entering a lift, the squad prepared for their ultimate objective, the theft of the Core Ship launch codes, which were housed on the bridge. At that moment, a battle droid announced over a loudspeaker that all primary systems would overload in five minutes.<ref name=\"SW:RC\" />\n\nDelta Squad charged through multiple corridors, meeting dozens of droids on the way, and finally entered the bridge with only about one and a half minutes to spare. They brought down three auto-turrets and a squad of B1 battle droids, and Fixer began extracting the codes from a console as droidekas and B2s began swarming onto the bridge. After a minute, Delta Squad, gravely injured and being constantly hit by laser bolts, retreated through a corridor to a waiting LAAT/i Gunship just as the Core Ship began to explode. Delta squad was one of only a handful of Republic Commando squads not to lose any members during the Battle of Geonosis.<ref name=\"SW:RC\" />\n\n===501st Mission===\n{{Quote|Frankly I'm still amazed we ever made it through the first hour, never mind the first day.|Entry from the [[501st Journal]]|<ref name=\"BF2\" />}}\nDuring the battle, a portion of the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] engaged in combat. A clone trooper was assigned to secure [[Checkpoint Alpha]]. He encountered three B2 super battle droid scouts, but managed to destroy them before they called in reinforcements. Blowing a Hailfire droid to pieces with his thermal detonators, he then secured the wreckage of a nearby ''Hardcell''-class interstellar transport.<ref name=\"BF2\" />\n\nThe events soon became a full scale battle between the Geonosians, droids, and clones. A clone engineer was deployed to repair the [[Power droid/Legends|Power droids]] and [[FX-series medical assistant droid/Legends|FX-series medical assistant droids]], ensuring ammunition and medical supplies would aid the battle. During the course of the engagement, two Spider Droids arrived on the battlefield. The clone engineer was then ordered to the recently-deployed AT-TE. The Republic force soon destroyed the droids to prevent the balance of power from swinging.<ref name=\"BF2\" />\n\nA Geonosian soldier was shot and killed, which resulted in him dropping a [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocron]] on top of the wrecked ''Hardcell''. A [[Clone jet trooper/Legends|clone jet trooper]] was called in, and managed to get the [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]] to Checkpoint Alpha. The troopers then used the AT-TE to mount an assault on a nearby hill fortress, soon securing it. A [[Clone sharpshooter/Legends|clone sniper]] was deployed, and picked off Geonosians and droids alike. A [[Clone heavy assault trooper|clone heavy trooper]] came into play, using his rocket launcher to destroy a Spider droid.<ref name=\"BF2\" />\n\nGeneral Windu arrived shortly after and led an assault that secured the Northern CIS bunker against droids including [[Assault battle droid]]s, [[engineer battle droid]]s. and [[IG-100 MagnaGuard/Legends|IG-100 MagnaGuards]].<ref name=\"BF2\" />\n\n===Spire Mission===\nMaster Yoda then sent a group of clone troopers, an AT-TE, and a couple of LAAT/i gunships into battle. Their mission was to secure the Spire council chamber, and wipe out the remaining droids in the area. They first destroyed the Techno Union Transport ships, denying the droids escape. The clone troopers then wiped out the remaining droids, and successfully captured the spire. The droid defenses included [[battle droid assassin]]s, B2 battle droids, and destroyer droids.<ref name=\"BF I\">''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]''</ref>\n\n===Space battle===\n{{Quote|Droid transports may yet try to escape.

Navigating through the asteroid ring, the Jedi received a hyperspace transmission from the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Nym/Legends|Nym]], warning that [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Cavik Toth]] of [[Sabaoth Squadron/Legends|Sabaoth Squadron]] was en route to Geonosis with his Hex fleet. With the power of the biological weapon [[Trihexalon]], Toth intended to level the battlefield on Geonosis, under the orders of Count Dooku.<ref name=\"JSF\" />\n\nGalia and Tachi led the fight against Toth's 8 [[Hex Deployer]]s and 12 [[Hex Bomber|Bombers]] alongside [[Zeta Squadron (Jedi Order)|Zeta Squadron]], a squadron of Jedi pilots, including [[Darth Krayt|A'Sharad Hett]], [[Bant Eerin/Legends|Bant Eerin]], and [[The Dark Woman|An'ya Kuro]]. The Hex threat was summarily defeated under Jedi firepower, though the pilots were soon outmatched with the arrival of two [[Sabaoth destroyer]]s and complements of [[Sabaoth starfighter]]s and [[Sabaoth Defender|Defenders]]. Fortunately, Loyalist aid arrived in the form of Nym and the [[Lok Revenants/Legends|Lok Revenants]] with three [[G-400]] starfighters and Nym's [[Havoc (starfighter)|''Havoc'']] soon joined by three [[Mere cruiser]]s capable of taking down Toth's capital ships. Nym and his forces dealt with the [[capital ship turret]]s on the [[Destroyer/Legends|destroyers]] while the Jedi attacked the waves of fighters.<ref name=\"JSF\" />\n\nAfter one warship was destroyed, a third Destroyer emerged from hyperspace&mdash;Toth's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]]. The [[Mere]] cruisers, led by [[Antilles (Mere)|Antilles]] on the ''[[Tritus]]'', directed their fire on the second vessel while all starfighter forces then began to target the flagship's capital turrets before they could cripple the Mere cruisers. Developments on Geonosis forced Master Windu to call back Zeta Squadron leaving Gallia and Tachi with only the Revenants for support. Nym sustained critical damage to his craft during the fight, and was forced to leave the battlefield. Nevertheless, the Revenants penetrated the flagship's [[Deflector shield/Legends|deflector shields]], and the Destroyer's main systems went critical. Toth himself fled his flagship in a [[Cavik Toth's starfighter|personal starfighter]], and engaged Adi Gallia in single combat. Toth's weaponry could not overcome the Jedi's mastery of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and his fighter was destroyed moments before his flagship exploded.<ref name=\"JSF\" />\n\n===Confrontation with Count Dooku===\n{{Quote|I can't take Dooku alone!

A Republic gunship carrying Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and clone troopers pursued him. Dooku's wing guard of fighters piloted by Geonosians opened fire on the gunship; the resulting attack on the gunship led to Amidala and a clone trooper falling to the desert below. While Skywalker protested that they should not leave Amidala behind, Kenobi persuaded him that they had a mission. The gunship continued to pursue, deploying Kenobi and Skywalker into the Count's hangar shortly before being destroyed by laser fire.<ref name=\"AotC\" /> Trailing Dooku and the Republic gunship was General Mace Windu in a [[Hovertank/Legends|fighter tank]], who was intercepted by three of Dooku's [[Dark Acolyte/Legends|Dark Acolytes]] in front of the hangar. They engaged Windu in combat, and all three were killed by the Jedi Master's TX-130S fighter tank, but not soon enough to allow the Korun master to involve himself in the fight.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars game\" />\n\n====Kenobi vs. Dooku====\n[[File:Sai.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kenobi and Dooku engaging one another.]]\nUpon arriving at Dooku's hangar, Kenobi and Skywalker challenged the Count. As Kenobi began to strategize, Skywalker, his anger getting the best of him, charged at Dooku. Dooku released a barrage of [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] and blasted Skywalker aside before turning to Kenobi. Kenobi began to circle Dooku as the Count attempted to blast Kenobi with another bolt of Force lightning, demanding the Jedi Knight's surrender. Kenobi grounded the blast on his lightsaber and calmly stated that he would not withdraw. Drawing his lightsaber and angling the blade into a guard position, Dooku awaited Kenobi. Kenobi promptly charged at Dooku and attacked, but Dooku quickly deflected Kenobi's initial attack and his subsequent jab. After a quick flurry of bladework, Kenobi slashed at Dooku's legs. Dooku overleapt the attack and flourished his blade to drive Kenobi back as he landed. As Kenobi fell back, Dooku calmly [[Dun M\u00f6ch/Legends|taunted]] him, telling him that he had expected a better performance from someone who was held in such high esteem by Yoda.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nKenobi attacked again, attempting to regain the offensive, but was forced into retreat by Dooku's elegant [[Form II/Legends|Form II]] bladework. Dooku quickly seized the offensive, the precision bladework of his Makashi style wearing away at Kenobi's [[Form III/Legends|Form III]] defense. Despite the energy efficiency of Kenobi's defense, Dooku's precision was so great that most of Kenobi's defensive slashes missed Dooku's blade entirely, forcing him to awkwardly scramble to fend off Dooku's attacks and quickly tiring him.<ref name=\"AOTC novel\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'' novelization]]</ref> Eventually Kenobi, straining to keep up, was pulled into a bladelock. Dooku, a wide grin on his face, pushed Kenobi's blade aside, and suddenly jabbed at Kenobi's arm, cutting it across the side. As Kenobi fell back in pain, the Count stayed on him, slashing the Jedi across the leg and bringing him down. Despite his wisely shown restraint against Dooku, Kenobi, fatigued by the battle, wielding an unfamiliar lightsaber, and outmatched by Dooku's skills, was defeated.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nAs Dooku raised his lightsaber to kill Kenobi, Skywalker recovered from the blast of Force lightning and saw Kenobi's predicament. Leaping across the hangar from the corner in which he lay, Skywalker reached the two in time to block the Count's blow. As Dooku turned to regard Skywalker, Kenobi used the Force to retrieve his fallen saber and tossed it to Skywalker.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\n====Skywalker vs. Dooku====\n{{Quote|Brave of you, boy, but I would have thought you had learned your lesson.''\"<br />\"''I ''am'' a slow learner.|Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker|<ref name=\"AotC\" />}}\n[[File:Duel_in_the_Geonosian_Hangar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker and Dooku battle.]]\nSkywalker, taking up the second blade, began to unleash of flurry of broad [[Form IV/Legends|Form IV]] attacks, briefly taking the Count off his guard.<ref name=\"AotC\" /> While initially surprised, Dooku was able to recover his guard and drive Anakin back. Owing to his little practical experience with [[Jar'Kai|dual-wielding]], Skywalker was forced to revert to his standard [[Form V/Legends|Form V]] practices when Dooku masterfully disarmed him, flicking his second blade out of Skywalker's hand and destroying the hilt in mid air. Warding off Dooku with two rapid strikes, Skywalker quickly retreated, regaining his composure.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nSlashing a power cable connected to Dooku's ship as he raised his blade into a high guard, Skywalker caused a short circuit that briefly caused the hangar lights to flicker. As the chamber dimmed, the two advanced on each other. As they stared at one another, blades at the ready, Skywalker attacked. The two engaged in a flurry of swordplay, seemingly equally matched.<ref name=\"AotC\" /> Briefly breaking off, Dooku quickly reassessed Anakin's strength before quickly attacking, and the duel resumed.<ref name=\"AOTC novel\" /> Despite holding his own against Dooku for much of the duel, Skywalker was finally brought down when Dooku twirled and slashed off his arm with a sudden undercut. As Anakin cried out in pain, Dooku blasted the Jedi aside with a Force push. Skywalker eventually landed at Kenobi's feet.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\n====Yoda vs. Dooku====\n{{Quote|Master Yoda.''\"<br />\"''Count Dooku.''\"<br />\"''You have interfered with our affairs for the last time.''\"<br />\"''Powerful, you have become, Dooku.

Turning to the hangar entrance, Dooku and the newly-arrived Yoda regarded one another. Dooku attempted to kill Yoda by telekinetically ripping wall fixtures out of the hangar sides and hurling them at Yoda. When the ancient Jedi blocked, Dooku countered by ripping chunks of stone out of the hangar ceiling, a dangerous proposition as the hangar was carved out of a cavern and doing so could cause a cave-in. Yoda caught the chunks and threw them aside, turning to Dooku and acknowledging his power, but noting that he sensed the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] in Dooku. Dooku, affirming his apparent superior power, unleashed a barrage of Force lightning at Yoda. The Jedi effortlessly caught the lightning and deflected it back at Dooku, who again deflected it into a nearby wall. Dooku proceeded to unleash a second blast against Yoda, but as a show of his mastery, Yoda absorbed the bolt completely, with no need for deflection, showing Dooku the clear futility of this assault.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\nDooku brandished his lightsaber, stating that this contest would not be decided by their mastery of the Force, but rather by their skill with a lightsaber. As Yoda drew his own weapon, Dooku leapt into action, unleashing his full Form II mastery against Yoda. However, Yoda's own mastery of Form IV allowed him to hold off Dooku's relentless attacks, and seize the offensive. Realizing both that he would not be able to defeat Yoda and that Republic reinforcements would soon arrive, Dooku distracted Yoda by using the Force to topple one of the hangar's power columns onto Kenobi and Skywalker. As Yoda broke off the duel to telekinetically catch the power column, Dooku was able to quickly board [[Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop/Legends|his ship]] and escape.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n{{Quote|I have good news for you, my Lord.

They also decided to investigate the Sith Lord that Dooku had mentioned to Obi-Wan Kenobi during the latter's imprisonment, Darth Sidious, in case Dooku was truthful about this revelation. It would not be until [[19 BBY/Legends|three years later]], nearing the end of the Clone Wars, that they would eventually identify Sidious as being none other than the Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine.

Jackson requested George Lucas that his character be given a purple lightsaber because he wanted to be able to find himself in the Geonosis battle scene in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Attack of the Clones'']].

It would be the first major combat of the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as the first major battle the Jedi would fight in years.\n\n\u2022 Prelude\n\nYoda\nIn 22 BBY, the Galactic Republic was in the midst of a crisis. Thousands of star systems and conglomerates including the Trade Federation, InterGalactic Banking Clan, Techno Union, Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance, had seceded and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems under the guidance of former-Jedi Count Dooku as terrorist strikes hit the capital planet Coruscant. The Republic Senate planned to meet that year to discuss the Military Creation Act. Three months before the vote, angry showdowns occurred between planets' inhabitants and among the two opposing governments while the Refugee Relief Movement tried to help where possible.\nThe day of the vote, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo arrived on Coruscant to vote against the Act, but faced an assassination attempt. She was then assigned Jedi protectors&mdash;Obi-Wan Kenobi and his youthful Padawan, Anakin Skywalker. Kenobi followed the trail of the toxic dart which ended the life of the assassin while Skywalker escorted the Senator back to Naboo.\nKenobi followed the tip from his friend Dexter Jettster to the planet Kamino, which had been erased from the Jedi Archives by forces unknown. There he discovered that ten years earlier, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas had placed an order for a clone trooper army. During the tour, he met the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Kenobi reported back to the Jedi Council and decided to pursue Fett, suspecting that he was involved in the assassination attempt. They battled on a landing platform, and Kenobi was able to plant a homing beacon on Fett's ship.\nOn his way to Geonosis, Dooku encoded a message to General Sevrance Tann telling her he foresaw a great battle was about to happen. He also ordered her to prepare for his swift departure.\nKenobi pursued Fett to Geonosis. His ship barely avoided a homing torpedo, and he landed on the surface. He snuck into a facility and watched a meeting of Separatist leadership, where it was revealed that Viceroy Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation was behind Amidalas assassination attempt. Kenobi reported back to the Jedi Council but was captured by destroyer droids. His signal was rerouted through Amidalas ship on Tatooine, as she and Skywalker had traveled there in a failed attempt to rescue his mother. Meanwhile, Dooku met with the captive Kenobi to try to turn him to his side, even revealing that the events on Naboo years prior had in fact been orchestrated by a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious, and also strongly insinuated that Sidious was one of the high ranking officials of the Republic's government. Kenobi refused, and Dooku suggested it would be difficult for him to secure his release.\nSkywalker and Amidala traveled to Geonosis to rescue Kenobi but were captured in the Geonosis droid foundries. The two were sentenced to death in the Petranaki arena along with Kenobi. When Kenobi enquired them as to why they were present, Skywalker explained Amidala's idea to rescue him, with Kenobi sarcastically congratulating them for the failed objective. They narrowly escaped their executions, which involved an acklay, a nexu, and a reek.\nIn response to Kenobis report about the Separatists conspiracy, the Galactic Senate, at the suggestion of Representative Jar Jar Binks, granted Supreme Chancellor Palpatine \"emergency powers\" to deal with the crisis.\nJedi Grand Master Yoda brought the secret clone trooper army into use, and sent them to Geonosis right behind a Jedi strike force. The rapid nature of the deployment off Kamino left \"Cuy'val Dar\" sergeants such as Kal Skirata reeling at waking up to discover the commando squads they had trained gone.\n\n\u2022 The battle\n\n\u2022 Penetrating the defenses\n\nAnakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala\nA group of 200 Jedi,The Essential Atlas led by Jedi Masters Mace Windu, Coleman Trebor, Eeth Koth, Kit Fisto, Plo Koon, Shaak Ti, Even Piell, Luminara Unduli and Ki-Adi-Mundi were sent to Geonosis by the Jedi High Council to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi and investigate reports that Separatists were constructing an army on Geonosis.\nUpon entering the system, the fleet of Jedi starfighters were fired upon by Anti-orbital cannons, taking several casualties. Mace Windu and Luminara Unduli slipped past the firing range of the cannons and piloted TX-130S fighter tanks, and employed communications jamming to stop any CIS forces from calling for reinforcements. They set off to disable the orbital cannons. The droid defenses, consisting of GATs, Hailfire droids, and STAPs, attempted to hold them off, but were destroyed by the Jedi. The power nodes were destroyed, causing the cannons to explode.\nThe last cannon, however, was housed in a Geonosian base. Windu set out on foot to disable the cannon. He penetrated the droid defenses and destroyed the last power nodes with his lightsaber. With the orbital defenses disabled, a landing zone had to be made. The Jedi strike team landed in a captured Confederate outpost and moved toward the arena in a convoy of RTTs. Windu and Unduli cleared the way in their tanks. They reached the perimeter of the arena, where they destroyed tunnel catacombs deploying battle droids. The Jedi deployed into the arena quietly.\nAlso around this time, the Acclamator-class assault ship Aken was traveling to Geonosis through its asteroid belt. Aken was escorted by Jedi starfighters lead by Adi Gallia, who had traveled from Nod Kartha, and Siri Tachi. After they were spotted by droid starfighters, the Jedi had to defend the Aken from two C-9979 landing craft and two Trade Federation Missile Frigates that appeared behind them along with Geonosian starfighters from the surface. The Separatist forces pushed the Republic group forward until the Aken reached the edge of the asteroid ring. There, a blockade of Missile Frigates arrived to trap them. Gallia led the starfighters and destroyed a pair of the frigates in their line. This allowed the Aken to escape and eventually reach the surface of Geonosis. Eventually, the rest of the Acclamator-class Assault ships penetrated the atmosphere, and proceeded to make pre-emptive strikes against the Geonosian beak-wing facilities, which resulted in the few fighters remaining unable to make headway against the Republic's orbital blockade.\nRepublic Strategic Command, including the Zilkin Meebur Gascon, was involved in planning the battle and analyzing maps to direct Republic forces. Gaba-18 airspeeders provided reconnaissance. V-19 Torrent starfighter prototypes also fought in the battle.\n\n\u2022 Arena battle\n\nMace Windu to Dooku and the Separatist leadership\nThe three captives, Skywalker, Amidala and Kenobi managed to avoid the beasts that had been set upon them long enough for Master Windus rescue mission team to arrive. However, Count Dooku revealed the Separatists new secret battle droid army, and a heated battle took place. At one point in the battle, the Padawan Tu'ala, taking after her master, sacrificed herself to save Anakin Skywalker from a Geonosian soldier.The Lesson (Star Wars Tales)\nThough outnumbered, the Jedi fought to the end. As the Jedi appeared throughout the arena, many Geonosians fled the arena.\nIt was during the heated battle that followed that bounty hunter Jango Fett attempted to fight and kill the legendary Korun Jedi Master, Mace Windu. However, during the fight, the reek nearly trampled Fett and damaged his jet pack. After killing the reek, Fett was charged by Mace Windu; at the last second the Mandalorian attempted to activate his jetpack, but failed. The Jedi closed in on Fett, initially slashing his left hand and cutting it off before decapitating the infamous bounty hunter. His battered helmet was soon found by his \"son\" Boba Fett. However, Dookus forces held the upper hand. C-3PO had accidentally lost his head in a droid factory, and his head was attached to a battle droids body, while his own body walked onto the assembly line and had a battle droid's head attached in turn. Both incarnations of C-3PO were defeated in the arena and were re-attached by R2-D2. Eventually, Dooku signaled for a cessation of the fight. He offered the chance to surrender, but Windu refused, saying the Jedi would not become hostages. Dooku then remorsefully signaled the surrounding droids to execute the Jedi.\nMeanwhile, huge Republic assault ships penetrated the upper atmosphere and dropped a fleet of gunships, carrying thousands of clone troopers and dozens of AT-TEs as well as Jedi General Yoda, to the surface. By the time the fleet reached the arena, the Jedi had already suffered heavy casualties; all but just over 20 had been killed. Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones novelization, p. 331 Yoda ordered the clones to form a perimeter around the survivors as they evacuated. As they left, the empty stadium was littered with droid parts as the opening battle of the Clone Wars began.\nStar Wars: Force Collection\nA Jedi joined the strike team, cutting down numerous battle droids. As the battle spread past the arena, the Jedi continued to fight.Star Wars: Force Collection Geonosis Battlefield Events\n\n\u2022 Desert battle\n\nYoda\nAround the time of the arena battle, a group of clone troopers lead by Jedi Master Adi Gallia and Jedi Knight Siri Tachi attacked a power plant that fueled the droid foundries in the surrounding area. After having escorted the Aken to the surface of Geonosis, Master Gallia and Siri Tachi led several LAAT/i gunships at their command to deploy troopers near the power plant. The two Jedi defended the clones on the ground and in the air from Separatist forces which included battle droids, Armored Assault Tanks, and droid starfighters. Along the way, Gallia had the gunships destroy a nearby Trade Federation Core Ship. Clone troopers eventually reached the power plant and set up explosives inside it. After the plant was detonated by the clones, Adi Gallia and Siri Tachi took to space to prevent Separatist transports from escaping.\nAfter the rescue of the Jedi, the droid and clone armies engaged one another in a complex series of engagements on a number of different fronts. The Republic army landed in twelve Acclamator-class assault ships, off-loading infantry, armored vehicles, artillery, and air support. The Separatist army consisted of droid infantry of varying strength and larger droid-controlled vehicles.\nThe Battle of Geonosis was primarily a ground campaign. However, the Republics crucial use of aerial bombardment of the Separatists fighter craft allowed the Republic's gunships to have air superiority throughout much of the battle, giving the clone forces a crucial advantage. And although the clone troopers were vastly outnumbered by droids, the droids were heavily exposed to attacks from the air by Republic gunships. The Republic gunships were instrumental in clearing away the Hailfire droids and allowing the AT-TEs to establish superiority on the battlefield, although the Hailfires were able to shoot down a number of LAATs, and a few were destroyed by lucky shots from laser emplacements.\nClone trooper CT-1226s regiment was deployed near the arena. A wave of droids headed toward the force. One of the Republic walkers launched a projectile which created a crater, and CT-1226 fell into it. A Hailfire droid passed over his head. A B2-HA series super battle droid swatted aside B1 battle droids to target one of the walkers. CT-1226 was able to target the B2s heat exchangers, and a missile the droid launched hit a Hailfire instead. CT-1226 disabled the B2 with an electromagnetic pulse grenade and destroyed the droid with his blaster. The clone was then helped inside the walker as it plowed through the hole in the droid's defensive formation CT-1226 had formed.\nSeparatist General Sevrance Tann was ordered to clear the way for Count Dooku. Along with a force of B2 super battle droids, she proceeded along a canyon where Confederacy forces engaged Republic forces. Tann took control of surviving units, including Mortar Super Battle Droids, Repeater super battle droids, heavy dwarf spider droids to battle Clone Scout Walkers and Clone Personal Walkers, and OG-9 spider droids to duel AT-TEs. At least one Blurrg trooper fought in those skirmishes. A trooper kept Tann updated with Count Dookus status. Near the end of the canyon, Tann dueled and defeated three Jedi Knights. When Dooku arrived at the end of the canyon, he congratulated her for her efforts.\nRepublic reconnaissance troopers mounted their speeder bikes and raced across the battlefield, gathering vital information about enemy activity. Elsewhere, Geonosian-trained acklays and nexus devoured unfortunate clone troopers. A group of the airborne infantry, including Battalion Commander CRC-09/571, led the frontal assault on the Separatist Core Ships. Jedi Master Mace Windu, who was fighting on the ground, made his way to a LAAT/i and used it to destroy several Hardcell-class interstellar transports before landing and defending in a TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank SPHA guns bringing down Core Ships. In this way, another three Core Ships were taken down, before Windu was informed that contact with Master Yoda had been lost. Windu raced off to find the Grand Master but was intercepted by a trio of Dooku's Sith Acolytes piloting Enforcer hovertanks. Windu was able to defeat the trio.\nHaving beaten the droid army into retreat, Yoda noted that much of the Confederate Navy was still grounded receiving shipments of droids when the Republic attacked. Lightly armored and vulnerable Techno Union starships attempted to withdraw immediately, but many were destroyed in the first wave of attacks from the Republic gunships. The Jedi Master now ordered the army's artillery to attempt to take down as many of the heavily armored Trade Federation Core Ships as possible, as they each held millions of deadly battle droids, and managed to bring down at least one.\nDespite taking control of the surface of the planet, the Republic was unable to capture the Separatist leadership and stop the war before it began, and most of the Confederacy's battle droids and heavy equipment escaped aboard Core Ships.\nMeanwhile, Jedi Master Echuu Shen-Jon and a team of other Jedi, including Plo Koon, destroyed several Core Ships and Techno Union vessels. They received reinforcements in the form of 10 GAR Energy Pummels carried aboard AA-9 freighters while a nearby Republic Starship and Gunship Bombers engaged targets of opportunity. Corporate Alliance Artillery Regulars were among the Separatist forces. The Jedi team then set off to pursue Count Dooku. However, they were delayed by Sevrance Tann, who killed Stam Reath, Echuus apprentice, angering Shen-Jon. Tann then escaped.\nIn the midst of battle, the Republic's Hawkbat Battalion was ordered to march directly into the line of fire of a column of spider droids. The battalion was almost completely annihilated, but Captain Deviss, leader of K Company, stayed behind in a shallow crater to tend to two critically injured troopers at great personal risk. Surrounded by spider droids, he defended their position for three hours until the casevac team arrived. His heroic acts had not been in vain, as the two men under his command were rescued.\nElsewhere, ARC trooper Jangotat, previously having studied power cell recharge cycles, recognized when a Hailfire droid was about to enter a reflux pattern. The whine of the droids capacitor was barely audible, but CT-96/298 leapt from cover and eliminated the Hailfire before it could explode, thus saving the lives of five of his cohorts.The Cestus Deception'\nDeep within the Geonosian catacombs, the Separatist Kaleesh/cyborg General Grievous had his first combat deployment during the battle. He killed Master Ur-Sema Du and a battalion of clone troopers with an electrostaff, claiming the Jedi's lightsaber as part of what would soon be his gruesome \"collection.\"\nLater, above a crevasse, the Republic Commando squad Theta Squad rappelled in and placed charges on a Geonosian door, while Delta Squad held off OG-9 homing spider droids nearby. After the door was blown, Theta and Delta entered the Geonosian caverns and split up. Heading for a droid foundry, Theta squad leader Taler ordered Darman to stay behind and hold a position while the rest moved forward. 1136, or Darman, lost contact with his squad and pulled out. He was the only survivor of Theta.\nDelta Squad managed to kill Geonosian Separatist General Sun Fac as he attempted to flee the planet in his personal Geonosian fighter. They also spotted General Grievouss Soulless One'. The acquisition of the codes allowed the Republic artillery and fleet to take down the rest of the CIS fleet. Along the way, Delta Squad also eliminated significant numbers of droids, Geonosian warriors, and an anti-aircraft turret.\nA LAAT/i gunship deployed the four members of Delta Squad into a canyon relatively close the Core Ship access way. They proceeded into the canyon, and fought through a series of ambushes. They finally reached the entrance to the Core Ship, but they were unable to penetrate the shield, so their Clone advisor, 01/425, ordered them to blast through a rock wall to reach a nearby exit. Boss led his three commandos towards the second door, and the defending droids were destroyed in short order.\nSuddenly, however, an A-DSD advanced dwarf spider droid came through a different doorway, and began firing its cannons at the stranded squad. After several intense minutes, the droid was blown up, and a gunship blasted the shield protecting the Core Ship's entryway, allowing access for Delta Squad.\nThe squad split up, tasked with sabotaging various crucial systems. Boss stormed through the B2 battle droid storage racks, rapidly finishing off any of them that were activated. Boss found Sev in a corridor just before three destroyer droids rolled by, but they easily destroyed them using EC detonators, proceeding to save Scorch and Fixer, who were under heavy fire. Now together Delta Squad encountered a battle droid dispenser, then several Geonosian elites and a second Advanced dwarf spider droid. Entering a lift, the squad prepared for their ultimate objective, the theft of the Core Ship launch codes, which were housed on the bridge. At that moment, a battle droid announced over a loudspeaker that all primary systems would overload in five minutes.\nDelta Squad charged through multiple corridors, meeting dozens of droids on the way, and finally entered the bridge with only about one and a half minutes to spare. They brought down three auto-turrets and a squad of B1 battle droids, and Fixer began extracting the codes from a console as droidekas and B2s began swarming onto the bridge. After a minute, Delta Squad, gravely injured and being constantly hit by laser bolts, retreated through a corridor to a waiting LAAT/i Gunship just as the Core Ship began to explode. Delta squad was one of only a handful of Republic Commando squads not to lose any members during the Battle of Geonosis.\n\n\u2022 501st Mission\n\nEntry from the 501st Journal\nDuring the battle, a portion of the 501st Legion engaged in combat. A clone trooper was assigned to secure Checkpoint Alpha. He encountered three B2 super battle droid scouts, but managed to destroy them before they called in reinforcements. Blowing a Hailfire droid to pieces with his thermal detonators, he then secured the wreckage of a nearby Hardcell-class interstellar transport.\nThe events soon became a full scale battle between the Geonosians, droids, and clones. A clone engineer was deployed to repair the Power droids and FX-series medical assistant droids, ensuring ammunition and medical supplies would aid the battle. During the course of the engagement, two Spider Droids arrived on the battlefield. The clone engineer was then ordered to the recently-deployed AT-TE. The Republic force soon destroyed the droids to prevent the balance of power from swinging.\nA Geonosian soldier was shot and killed, which resulted in him dropping a Sith holocron on top of the wrecked Hardcell. A clone jet trooper was called in, and managed to get the holocron to Checkpoint Alpha. The troopers then used the AT-TE to mount an assault on a nearby hill fortress, soon securing it. A clone sniper was deployed, and picked off Geonosians and droids alike. A clone heavy trooper came into play, using his rocket launcher to destroy a Spider droid.\nGeneral Windu arrived shortly after and led an assault that secured the Northern CIS bunker against droids including Assault battle droids, engineer battle droids. and IG-100 MagnaGuards.\n\n\u2022 Spire Mission\n\nMaster Yoda then sent a group of clone troopers, an AT-TE, and a couple of LAAT/i gunships into battle. Their mission was to secure the Spire council chamber, and wipe out the remaining droids in the area. They first destroyed the Techno Union Transport ships, denying the droids escape. The clone troopers then wiped out the remaining droids, and successfully captured the spire. The droid defenses included battle droid assassins, B2 battle droids, and destroyer droids.Star Wars: Battlefront\n\n\u2022 Space battle\n\nAdi Gallia to Siri Tachi\nFollowing an initial raid on a Geonosian power plant, Adi Gallia and Siri Tachi flew into orbit in their Delta-7 starfighters, intending to intercept escaping droid transports. Navigating through the asteroid ring, the Jedi received a hyperspace transmission from the pirate Nym, warning that Captain Cavik Toth of Sabaoth Squadron was en route to Geonosis with his Hex fleet. With the power of the biological weapon Trihexalon, Toth intended to level the battlefield on Geonosis, under the orders of Count Dooku.\nGalia and Tachi led the fight against Toths 8 Hex Deployers and 12 Bombers alongside Zeta Squadron, a squadron of Jedi pilots, including ASharad Hett, Bant Eerin, and Anya Kuro. The Hex threat was summarily defeated under Jedi firepower, though the pilots were soon outmatched with the arrival of two Sabaoth destroyers and complements of Sabaoth starfighters and Defenders. Fortunately, Loyalist aid arrived in the form of Nym and the Lok Revenants with three G-400 starfighters and Nyms Havoc soon joined by three Mere cruisers capable of taking down Toth's capital ships. Nym and his forces dealt with the capital ship turrets on the destroyers while the Jedi attacked the waves of fighters.\nAfter one warship was destroyed, a third Destroyer emerged from hyperspace&mdash;Toths flagship. The Mere cruisers, led by Antilles on the Tritus, directed their fire on the second vessel while all starfighter forces then began to target the flagships capital turrets before they could cripple the Mere cruisers. Developments on Geonosis forced Master Windu to call back Zeta Squadron leaving Gallia and Tachi with only the Revenants for support. Nym sustained critical damage to his craft during the fight, and was forced to leave the battlefield. Nevertheless, the Revenants penetrated the flagships deflector shields, and the Destroyers main systems went critical. Toth himself fled his flagship in a personal starfighter, and engaged Adi Gallia in single combat. Toths weaponry could not overcome the Jedi's mastery of the Force, and his fighter was destroyed moments before his flagship exploded.\n\n\u2022 Confrontation with Count Dooku\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi to Anakin Skywalker\nIn the confusion of the battle, the Separatist leader Dooku tried to flee to a hangar where his starship was docked. A Republic gunship carrying Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and clone troopers pursued him. Dookus wing guard of fighters piloted by Geonosians opened fire on the gunship; the resulting attack on the gunship led to Amidala and a clone trooper falling to the desert below. While Skywalker protested that they should not leave Amidala behind, Kenobi persuaded him that they had a mission. The gunship continued to pursue, deploying Kenobi and Skywalker into the Counts hangar shortly before being destroyed by laser fire. Trailing Dooku and the Republic gunship was General Mace Windu in a fighter tank, who was intercepted by three of Dookus Dark Acolytes in front of the hangar. They engaged Windu in combat, and all three were killed by the Jedi Masters TX-130S fighter tank, but not soon enough to allow the Korun master to involve himself in the fight.\n\n\u2022 Kenobi vs. Dooku\n\nUpon arriving at Dookus hangar, Kenobi and Skywalker challenged the Count. As Kenobi began to strategize, Skywalker, his anger getting the best of him, charged at Dooku. Dooku released a barrage of Force lightning and blasted Skywalker aside before turning to Kenobi. Kenobi began to circle Dooku as the Count attempted to blast Kenobi with another bolt of Force lightning, demanding the Jedi Knights surrender. Kenobi grounded the blast on his lightsaber and calmly stated that he would not withdraw. Drawing his lightsaber and angling the blade into a guard position, Dooku awaited Kenobi. Kenobi promptly charged at Dooku and attacked, but Dooku quickly deflected Kenobis initial attack and his subsequent jab. After a quick flurry of bladework, Kenobi slashed at Dookus legs. Dooku overleapt the attack and flourished his blade to drive Kenobi back as he landed. As Kenobi fell back, Dooku calmly taunted him, telling him that he had expected a better performance from someone who was held in such high esteem by Yoda.\nKenobi attacked again, attempting to regain the offensive, but was forced into retreat by Dookus elegant Form II bladework. Dooku quickly seized the offensive, the precision bladework of his Makashi style wearing away at Kenobis Form III defense. Despite the energy efficiency of Kenobis defense, Dookus precision was so great that most of Kenobis defensive slashes missed Dookus blade entirely, forcing him to awkwardly scramble to fend off Dookus attacks and quickly tiring him.Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones novelization Eventually Kenobi, straining to keep up, was pulled into a bladelock. Dooku, a wide grin on his face, pushed Kenobis blade aside, and suddenly jabbed at Kenobis arm, cutting it across the side. As Kenobi fell back in pain, the Count stayed on him, slashing the Jedi across the leg and bringing him down. Despite his wisely shown restraint against Dooku, Kenobi, fatigued by the battle, wielding an unfamiliar lightsaber, and outmatched by Dookus skills, was defeated.\nAs Dooku raised his lightsaber to kill Kenobi, Skywalker recovered from the blast of Force lightning and saw Kenobis predicament. Leaping across the hangar from the corner in which he lay, Skywalker reached the two in time to block the Counts blow. As Dooku turned to regard Skywalker, Kenobi used the Force to retrieve his fallen saber and tossed it to Skywalker.\n\n\u2022 Skywalker vs. Dooku\n\nCount Dooku and Anakin Skywalker\nSkywalker, taking up the second blade, began to unleash of flurry of broad Form IV attacks, briefly taking the Count off his guard. While initially surprised, Dooku was able to recover his guard and drive Anakin back. Owing to his little practical experience with dual-wielding, Skywalker was forced to revert to his standard Form V practices when Dooku masterfully disarmed him, flicking his second blade out of Skywalkers hand and destroying the hilt in mid air. Warding off Dooku with two rapid strikes, Skywalker quickly retreated, regaining his composure.\nSlashing a power cable connected to Dookus ship as he raised his blade into a high guard, Skywalker caused a short circuit that briefly caused the hangar lights to flicker. As the chamber dimmed, the two advanced on each other. As they stared at one another, blades at the ready, Skywalker attacked. The two engaged in a flurry of swordplay, seemingly equally matched. Briefly breaking off, Dooku quickly reassessed Anakins strength before quickly attacking, and the duel resumed. Despite holding his own against Dooku for much of the duel, Skywalker was finally brought down when Dooku twirled and slashed off his arm with a sudden undercut. As Anakin cried out in pain, Dooku blasted the Jedi aside with a Force push. Skywalker eventually landed at Kenobi's feet.\n\n\u2022 Yoda vs. Dooku\n\nCount Dooku and Grand Master Yoda\nAs Dooku briefly caught his breath, he noticed the sound of footsteps and the clack of a cane, as well as the characteristic panting. Turning to the hangar entrance, Dooku and the newly-arrived Yoda regarded one another. Dooku attempted to kill Yoda by telekinetically ripping wall fixtures out of the hangar sides and hurling them at Yoda. When the ancient Jedi blocked, Dooku countered by ripping chunks of stone out of the hangar ceiling, a dangerous proposition as the hangar was carved out of a cavern and doing so could cause a cave-in. Yoda caught the chunks and threw them aside, turning to Dooku and acknowledging his power, but noting that he sensed the dark side of the Force in Dooku. Dooku, affirming his apparent superior power, unleashed a barrage of Force lightning at Yoda. The Jedi effortlessly caught the lightning and deflected it back at Dooku, who again deflected it into a nearby wall. Dooku proceeded to unleash a second blast against Yoda, but as a show of his mastery, Yoda absorbed the bolt completely, with no need for deflection, showing Dooku the clear futility of this assault.\nDooku brandished his lightsaber, stating that this contest would not be decided by their mastery of the Force, but rather by their skill with a lightsaber. As Yoda drew his own weapon, Dooku leapt into action, unleashing his full Form II mastery against Yoda. However, Yodas own mastery of Form IV allowed him to hold off Dookus relentless attacks, and seize the offensive. Realizing both that he would not be able to defeat Yoda and that Republic reinforcements would soon arrive, Dooku distracted Yoda by using the Force to topple one of the hangar's power columns onto Kenobi and Skywalker. As Yoda broke off the duel to telekinetically catch the power column, Dooku was able to quickly board his ship and escape.\n\n\u2022 Aftermath and legacy\n\nDarth Tyranus and Darth Sidious\n.]]\nThe explosion of Toth's flagship was seen from the surface. Master Windu contacted Master Gallia for a status update. Gallia confirmed her mission was successful, and Windu informed her that the battle was over, although Dooku escaped and Skywalker had been wounded. The two later had a private meeting in the High Council Chamber.\nBy the end of the battle, only Republic soldiers remained. However, the victory had not come easy. When the Republic assault ship Implacable was extracted from Geonosis to Ord Mantell, med triage on board estimated 12,000 seriously injured men and 8,000 walking wounded. Approximately 72,000 clones were deemed combat-fit. Thousands of clone troopers had died in the fighting, and most of the Confederacy's army had been safely evacuated aboard Core Ships during the battle.\nGeonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser had fled along with the rest of the Separatist Council, and his warriors had retreated into the catacombs, where they resisted the Republic's every effort to dislodge them.\nDarth Tyranus arrived on Coruscant to meet with his master, who was settled in an abandoned executive building in The Works, not far from the Senate District and the Jedi Temple. Meanwhile, the Grand Army of the Republic was mobilized throughout the galaxy as the Clone Wars began.\nGrievous remained unknown to the Republic, for he killed off any of the Jedi or clones he encountered, while Sevrance Tann escaped Geonosis after killing Shen-Jons Padawan, Stam Reath.\nCuyval Dar sergeant Kal Skirata lost nine commandos that he trained in the battle, namely the casualties from Theta Squad, Teroch Squad, and Niners squad. He, Walon Vau, Niner, and Fi would later reflect that this had been due to the Jedi's ill-advised usage of the commandos as infantry rather than special forces.\nWhile back at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Masters Kenobi and Windu both expressed their mutual belief that the battle would not have been won without the clones, but Master Yoda retorted at the irony of Obi-Wans use of the word \"victory.\" The battle was but the first of many in what became known as the Clone Wars. They also decided to investigate the Sith Lord that Dooku had mentioned to Obi-Wan Kenobi during the latters imprisonment, Darth Sidious, in case Dooku was truthful about this revelation. It would not be until three years later, nearing the end of the Clone Wars, that they would eventually identify Sidious as being none other than the Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine. Skywalker, meanwhile, escorted Senator Amidala back to Naboo, where they were wed in a secret ceremony.\nAfter the battle, a collection of reports known as the Geonosian Debriefings was compiled, and for his role in the battle, CT-1226 was given a medal at the insistence of the Republic generals.\nJango Fetts son Boba buried his father and then took his ship to the moons of Bogden, where he engaged in a firefight.\nThe pirate Nym was later offered the post of commander of the Karthakk system, although he declined. Gallia then volunteered to be his personal \"Jedi advisor.\"\nIn the months following the battle Mace Windu would regret his decision not to strike down Count Dooku when he had the chance, and killing Jango Fett without a second thought.\nJedi Depa Billaba would later state to Windu on Haruun Kal that by simply bombing the arena on Geonosis, the Republic could have prevented a war that destroyed billions of lives at the expense of only a few hundred Jedi.\nAs the Separatists and Republic built up their forces, they engaged in harassment tactics. Shortly afterward, the two opposing governments fought the Decimator campaign and the Dark Reaper crisis.\nMonths later, the Republic occupation force was defeated, necessitating another planet-wide invasion.Landing at Point Rain\nOne year after the battle, the Geonosians began construction of the Death Star above Geonosis under the orders of Darth Sidious.\nBy two years after the battle, the Republic had built on Coruscant a memorial listing the names of every clone trooper that died during this first battle.\nThree years after the battle, when Skywalker and Kenobi confronted Dooku for what was ultimately the final time aboard the Invisible Hand above Coruscant, Kenobi told Skywalker that they are to fight him together this time around, referring to Skywalker's earlier brash attempt at attacking Dooku head-on that got him blasted with Force Lightning, with Skywalker admitting he was going to suggest the exact same thing.III\n\n\u2022 Participants\n\nMace Windu\n\n\u2022 Jedi and Republic\n\n\u2022 Survivors\n\nPablo-Jill\n\n\u2022 Victims\n\nTan Yuster]] (Human Jedi Padawan)\n\n\u2022 Confederacy\n\n\u2022 Survivors\n\nC-3PO]] (Head was accidentally attached to a battle droids body while his own body was attached to a battle droids head)\n\n\u2022 Victims\n\n\u2022 Sun Fac (Geonosian General, aide to Poggle the Lesser)\n\n\u2022 Jango Fett (Dooku's henchman, former Mandalore)\n\n\u2022 Cavik Toth (participated in the space battle above)\n\n\u2022 Dark Acolyte Trio (3 Dark Jedi)\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\n1\nThe First Battle of Geonosis continued the Star Wars sagas tradition of huge battles in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones'.\nA scene where Plo Koon and Ki-Adi-Mundi raid a Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship was originally going to be included, but did not appear in the final cut.StarWars.com Another cut scene was the appearance of the Corporate Alliance tank droid.\nAt one point in the arena battle, Ki-Adi-Mundi can be seen wielding a green lightsaber, unlike his customary blue lightsaber. In the arena battle, one of the Jedi in the strike team can be seen using a blue and a green lightsaber.\nIn the 2013 mobile card game Star Wars: Force Collection, players had the chance to take part in two large-scale \"quests\" known as the Geonosis Battlefields. The participation was optional, although this article assumes the player did so. The quest featured bosses such as B1 battle droids and Yoda, regardless of the player's alignment.\nSamuel L. Jackson requested George Lucas that his character be given a purple lightsaber because he wanted to be able to find himself in the Geonosis battle scene in Attack of the Clones. He reasoned that, since Windu is the second most powerful Jedi after Yoda, Windu should have a lightsaber of a different color from the customary red, blue, and green.\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\nNever!\nIn LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game and LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker face a battle droid firing squad rather than the three lethal beasts, and Anakin is seen wielding a green lightsaber.\nIn the 2012 young-readers book LEGO Star Wars: Anakin to the Rescue, Kenobi is captured by a trap set by Count Dooku&mdash;cookies.

The daughter of Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], Leia was the younger twin sister of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and, shortly after her birth, she became the adopted daughter of [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]] and [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Breha Organa/Legends|Breha]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], making her a [[Princess/Legends|Princess]] of Alderaan. An accomplished Senator, Leia Organa was most famous for her strong leadership during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] and other subsequent galactic conflicts, making her one of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] greatest heroes. Later she [[Wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa/Legends|married]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and became the mother of their three children: [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]], [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]], and [[Anakin Solo]]. Around the start of the [[Swarm War]], Leia unknowingly became a grandmother through Jacen's daughter [[Allana Djo Solo|Allana]].\n\nShe had a forceful personality and bright intellect, having accomplished much in her youth: she was a strong proponent for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], the youngest Senator ever of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] at eighteen standard years of age, and a member of the [[House of Organa/Legends|Royal Family of Alderaan]]. Years later, she was instrumental in the creation of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], and was elected to the position of [[Minister of State]], before becoming [[Chief of State (New Republic)/Legends|Chief of State]], serving twice in that office.\n\nDue to her powerful [[The Force/Legends|Force]] heritage, Leia, following her family's legacy, became a Jedi Knight in the [[New Jedi Order]]. She was partially trained by her brother Luke and later by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Saba Sebatyne]], who declared her a fully trained Knight at the end of the Swarm War. This training would serve her well as the galaxy teetered on the edge of collapse into civil war once more during the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], although it complicated her allegiance. During this conflict, Leia's son Jacen turned to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], becoming the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] Darth Caedus. Leia and Han became determined to destroy Caedus, feeling that their son was already dead. However, it was their daughter Jaina who ended his life in a [[Battle of Uroro Station|lightsaber duel]] that also concluded the war.\n\nIn the aftermath of Caedus' death, the Solos became the guardians of their granddaughter Allana, at the behest of her mother, [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]] of [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]], and remained two of the galaxy's most important figures, standing with the Jedi Order amidst the tensions that arose between it and the government of [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Natasi Daala]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life ([[19 BBY/Legends|19]]&ndash;[[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]])===\n====Birth on Polis Massa====\n{{Quote|It's a girl.''\"<br />\"''Leia.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padm\u00e9 Amidala|<ref name=\"ROTS\" />}}\n[[File:Baby_leia.png|thumb|left|200px|Leia shortly after birth]]\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], Leia was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] colony of [[Polis Massa/Legends|Polis Massa]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], shortly after the start of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]] and the [[Declaration of a New Order|formation]] of [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Her heavily-pregnant [[Parent/Legends|mother]], the [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], had suffered a [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Choke|Force choke]] by her [[Marriage/Legends|husband]] and Leia's father [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who had fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].<ref name=\"ROTS\" /> Amidala had been brought in a panic to a [[Polis Massa medical facility/Legends|hospital]] of the [[Polis Massa Research Base|Polis Massa Base]] by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who had arranged rendezvous with [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]], [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], and Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]].<ref name=\"ROTS:VD\">''[[Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> Due to Amidala's condition, the [[Kallidahin/Legends|Polis Massan]] surgeons were nearly forced to remove the twins she was carrying, but the children were born just in time.

Amidala's body was sent back to Naboo, with the instruction of preparing it to look like she was still pregnant. In this way, nobody would know of the children's existence. When they decided it would be best if the twins were separated, Master Kenobi suggested that he would take the boy, and Master Yoda would take Leia. However, Yoda disagreed, arguing that they should wait for the right time before [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] the twins in the ways of the Force. At that point, Bail Organa offered to adopt baby Leia, as he and his wife were childless and longing for a daughter.<ref name=\"ROTS:N\">[[Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'' novelization]]</ref> The Jedi agreed, and the infant boy Luke was sent to live on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] with his father's stepbrother [[Owen Lars/Legends|Owen Lars]] and his wife [[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru]].

However, she had inherited her biological father's gift, which surfaced for the first time in [[18 BBY/Legends|18 BBY]] when her caregiver [[Memily]] was about to lean on a weakened railing overlooking a cliff. By throwing a [[Laserball/Legends|laserball]] at it, Leia alerted Memily and saved her life.<ref name=\"Master of Deception\" />\n\nBecause of the incident, Leia became a target of the Galactic Empire for the first, but certainly not the last time. Word of a child with extraordinary reflexes had reached the galactic [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], and [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitors]] [[Ferus Olin]] and [[Hydra (Grand Inquisitor)|Hydra]] were sent to investigate. Olin, a former [[Padawan/Legends|Jedi apprentice]], was in fact a double agent trying to save as many Force-sensitives as possible, and had come to Alderaan on Obi-Wan Kenobi's behest. Even though the Inquisitorius was not aware of the child's [[Gender/Legends|gender]], Kenobi feared that the toddler might be Leia and wanted to turn the Empire's eye away from Alderaan. Olin covered up the incident, stating it was nothing more than a rumor, and Leia's heritage remained a secret. The Imperial informer turned out to be Deara Antilles; Queen Breha had mercy on her sister, but exiled her from the royal family forever.<ref name=\"Master of Deception\" /> Following the incident, Olin settled on Alderaan.

About six years old at the time, the Meeting was an unforgettable experience for Leia.<ref name=\"Children of the Jedi\" />\n\nDespite knowing that she was loved, Leia sometimes felt an outsider to her family. Winter was like a sister to her, but the young Princess still wished she had a brother or a sister of her own, someone she could truly feel close to.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" /> In her growing years, she often felt that she was just slightly different, without exactly knowing how,<ref name=\"Children of the Jedi\" /> and that a part of her was missing. Winter remained a comfort to Leia, despite the differences in their personality. Though the pair's physical resemblance was tempered by Winter's stunning white hair, the friends soon learned to employ similar looks for tactical advantage, a practice they would continue throughout their lives. Winter sometimes disguised herself as Leia so that the Princess could escape the [[Royal Palace of Alderaan/Legends|Aldera Royal Palace]] to create mischief and visit inappropriate boys.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" /> Leia also befriended [[Neena]], a musically talented girl about her age who lived in the Organa household.<ref name=\"Galaxy Guide 6: Tramp Freighters\">''[[Galaxy Guide 6: Tramp Freighters]]''</ref>\n\nBesides receiving palace education, Leia attended the [[Crevasse City Collegium for Young Ladies|Collegium for Young Ladies]] in [[Crevasse City (Alderaan)/Legends|Crevasse City]] as of [[12 BBY/Legends|12 BBY]]. During her time there, the young Leia expressed early tendencies toward rebellion. When the school's staff once served bottled juice instead of freshly squeezed, a seven-year-old Leia staged a sit-in protest with the other students. After playing the forbidden [[All Stars Burn as One|anthem]] of the Old Republic, and reprogramming the Collegium's security mainframe to swap every reference to Palpatine with a curse, the Princess was finally expelled from the school.<ref name=\"TFU2:DB\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]'' {{C|[[Wikipedia:PlayStation 3|PS3]]/[[Wikipedia:Xbox 360|Xbox 360]] databank}}</ref>\n\nIn the year [[11 BBY/Legends|11 BBY]], Leia and her friend Winter once hid a giant [[Alderaan furry moth|wooly moth]] in the desk drawer of Alderaan's [[Minister of Agriculture]]. The harmless joke, however, took a more serious turn when it was discovered that the moth had eaten the budget for the whole next year, written on a sheet of [[Flimsiplast/Legends|flimsiplast]]. As a means of punishment, Leia was banned from participating in a party held in the [[Grand Ballroom (Aldera Royal Palace)|Grand Ballroom]] of the Royal Palace. The Princess and Winter attended the gala anyway, hidden behind a marble staircase with a store of scavenged food. Having accidentally crossed the eyes of Fess Ilee, the young girls were afraid and got out of their hiding place, bumping into Bail Organa, who promptly banned them to their rooms. The following night, the Princess got over the wall so she could join Winter at the [[Gingerbell blossom festival]]. Walking alone in the deserted streets of Aldera, Leia was almost kidnapped by a trio of goons who worked for Senator [[Ask Aak/Legends|Ask Aak]] of [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]]. Aak wished to use the child as a bargaining chip so that Bail Organa would vote they way he wanted. The rapture attempt, however, was thwarted by Ferus Olin, who had been following the Princess in the streets. Later that night, Leia lost her way. The Princess climbed upon a half-finished building so she would be able to see the Palace in the distance, but she nearly fell while trying to climb down. Once again, Ferus Olin's timely intervention allowed Leia to escape unharmed.<ref name=\"RFH\" />\n\n[[9 BBY/Legends|Two years later]], Princess Leia was attending the prestigious [[Alderaan Select Academy for Young Ladies]] under the tutelage of the strict Madame [[Vesta]], whom the Princess described as \"a [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] of a nanny.\" Together with other daughters of Alderaanian [[Noble/Legends|nobles]], the Princess learned etiquette, table manners and many other useful (and to her mind, rather boring) things that a lady needed to know.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" /> During this time, Leia saw the downside of the upper class as well: many of the girls had a condescending attitude towards ordinary people, and expensive parties were thrown in the court even though many in the galaxy were hungry and suffering.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" /> Once she reached her adolescent years, Leia discovered that one of her school friends used drugs.<ref name=\"Planet of Twilight\">''[[Planet of Twilight]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:LeiaWinterCross.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jahan Cross \"mistakes\" Winter for Princess Leia.]]\nHowever, her adolescent years also had their share of cherished memories. Leia became friends with [[Heeth Panteer|Heeth]] and [[Raal Panteer]], two scions of the patrician [[House Panteer]]. Once, the Princess snuck out at night with Raal Panteer to swim in the reflecting pools of Aldera. The pair, who had fallen in love, exchanged their first kiss on that occasion, but the relationship failed to last. Organa and the Panteer brothers would meet again during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"A Little Piece of Home\">''[[Star Wars: Empire: A Little Piece of Home]]''</ref> At age thirteen, Leia and Winter met [[Jahan Cross]], the son of the Alderaanian diplomat [[Davim Cross]]. Both young girls had a \"mad crush\" on him, which, according to the Princess, \"lasted three whole days.\" \n\nAfter a long hiatus, the three met again in [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]], on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the [[Alderaan Ascendancy Contention]]. Upon seeing the two young ladies three years after leaving Alderaan, Cross made it look like he did not recognize Leia, \"mistaking\" Winter for the Princess on purpose.<ref name=\"AotEpt6\">[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1|''Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets'' 1]]</ref>\n\n====A senator in the making====\n{{Quote|I'm grooming her to take my place in the Imperial Senate.''\"<br />\"''Perhaps you should wean her first.|Bail Organa and Wilhuff Tarkin, discussing 13-year-old Leia|<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" />}}\n[[File:RunLeiaRun.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Leia runs away from Madame Vesta while Bail Organa and Wilhuff Tarkin watch.]]\nLeia showed promise in politics and from early on, Bail Organa began grooming her to one day succeed him in the Imperial Senate, encouraging her to attend Alderaanian debates and palace receptions for offworld personnel.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> In this Leia unknowingly followed the footsteps of not only her adoptive father, but her late birth mother, who had entered politics at an early age and became a Senator.

She had heard a lot about the [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] from her father, none of it good. She instantly disliked him, maintaining that he represented everything that was wrong with the Empire. Leia was particularly disgusted with the idea of Tarkin having a [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|slave]], as she did not understand how it was possible that the Emperor allowed [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]]. She even dropped a water balloon on his head while \"watering her plants.\" The visit made Leia seriously contemplate what kind of galaxy she lived in, and what she could do to change it.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" />\n\nAt the age of sixteen, Leia attended the [[University of Alderaan/Legends|University of Alderaan]] together with Winter, whose holographic and audiographic memory, as Leia would joke, was very useful with homework. They studied history and art, two subjects the Empire seemed eager to suppress, which in Bail Organa's opinion was all the more reason to study them.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" /> Leia also began training with [[Giles Durane]], a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] her father had hired to teach her self-defense and marksmanship.<ref name=\"The Weapons Master!\">{{StoryCite|story=The Weapons Master!|book=Star Wars Weekly 104|bformatted=''Star Wars Weekly'' 104}}</ref> True to her tomboyish nature, she enjoyed these lessons far more than those of Madame Vesta, and showed considerable talent in both areas.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" />\n\nAround this time, the Princess began to realize that her father was preparing her for something more than just becoming the next Senator of her home planet. A month before turning seventeen<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" />&mdash;the age of adulthood in the eyes of Alderaanian law<ref name=\"Age of responsibility\">It was established in ''[[Rebel Dawn]]'' that the \"age of responsibility\" on both Alderaan and Corellia was set at seventeen.</ref>&mdash;she accidentally overheard a secret [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] meeting Bail Organa was having with fellow Senators [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] of [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] and [[Garm Bel Iblis/Legends|Garm Bel Iblis]] of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], where the name [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] came up.

She decided not the tell her father what she had heard, but promised herself to make him proud and do whatever it took to restore the freedoms the Empire was systematically taking away.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_firstimpressions.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Leia, about to meet Emperor Palpatine for the first time]]\nAmong the Ancient Houses, it was customary to bring the daughters to Coruscant when they finished school at seventeen&mdash;or even sixteen, if the parents were ambitious to start the long and complex search of a suitable groom candidate at the Imperial Court. The Princess's aunts would have been glad to see their niece marry someone from one of the other old Houses; Leia, however, regarded their heirs as \"brainless twerps\" and refused to be presented to the Emperor until she could do so as a Senator in her own right, not simply as a young girl in the Court marriage market. Her aunts were horrified, doubly so when Leia's decision was backed by Bail Organa.<ref name=\"Children of the Jedi\" />\n\nThe time for Leia's introduction at the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]] came soon enough, though. At the age of 18, she became the youngest Imperial Senator ever elected,<ref name=\"Children of the Jedi\" /> and Bail Organa formally presented her to Palpatine shortly before she assumed her Senatorial post. Having witnessed earlier a Caamasi being arrested by two [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] for simply trying to buy a meal at a restaurant, Leia firmly decided that she would bring up the issue to Palpatine at the same time. When she met the Emperor, however, she became frightened by the dark side radiating from him and was unable to do anything more than mutter thanks to his compliments as [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] watched. Following the reception, Bail assured her that there was nothing to be ashamed of, as it was a common reaction to seeing Palpatine, especially for the first time. To make her feel better, Organa told Leia how proud he was of her, and related a piece of good news&mdash;he had arranged for the Caamasi she saw arrested to be released. Happy, Leia went to meet the Caamasi, who introduced himself as [[Eg'ros Akala]].<ref name=\"First Impressions\">{{Tales|15|First Impressions (comic story)}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial Senate and involvement in the Rebellion ([[2 BBY/Legends|2]]&ndash;[[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]])===\n====The Rebel Senator====\n{{Quote|You have your father's fire.

Her fire and abilities were noted by some Imperial officials because, as of [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], Leia was being held captive on the planet [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] to keep her out of the way. She was not harmed, but rather treated as a dignified \"guest\" as the Imperials in charge did not wish to provoke a galactic incident by harming the daughter of a powerful and wealthy Senator. Still, she was not allowed to leave, nor was she permitted to communicate with the outside world. Also, Captain [[Ozzik Sturn]] threatened to have her be an \"unfortunate victim in a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] uprising.\" While on the planet, Leia collected data on the [[Skyhook/Legends|Skyhook]] that was being used to take Wookiee slaves from the planet in mass numbers. She stored this data in her droid, [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]]. When Darth Vader's secret apprentice, [[Galen Marek]], arrived to save her in order to enlist the trust and cooperation of her father, Leia refused to leave until the skyhook was destroyed. Marek promised to destroy it if she would go leave the planet and fly to safety, which she did.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]''</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, Leia participated in the meeting on Corellia to establish the Rebel Alliance with her father, [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], [[Garm Bel Iblis/Legends|Garm Bel Iblis]], Jedi [[Rahm Kota/Legends|Rahm Kota]], and Galen Marek. However, while the other attendees of the meeting were present in person, Leia participated via [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]]. Her physical absence turned out to be beneficial as that her holo transmission was able to be terminated before her involvement could be discovered when the meeting was raided by stormtroopers led by Darth Vader. Thus her direct involvement with the new Rebellion was unknown to Vader and the Emperor.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nLeia was also present on Kashyyyk for the meeting that did officially establish the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Because Marek had sacrificed his own life to save her father, Kota, Mothma, and Bel Iblis from the Emperor so that they might live to establish the Rebellion, she suggested the adoption of his family crest as the symbol of the fight against the Empire.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\" />\n\n[[File:Constant_Spirit_Insider_145_by_Villeneuve.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The young senator Leia Organa on a diplomatic mission]]\nIn [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]],<ref name=\"First Impressions\" /> Bail Organa&mdash;now a known enemy of the Empire<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\" />&mdash;stepped down as Senator of Alderaan, a position he had held for thirty-one years, and Leia took his place. A keen political thinker, Leia knew that her diplomatic immunity and consular ship would be perfect for running covert missions for the Alliance. Bail agreed, and thus began Leia's double life as a Senator and a Rebel.<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" />\n\nYoung Senator Organa inherited her father's diplomatic cruiser, the [[CR90 corvette/Legends|Corellian corvette]] [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']].

The two became good friends, completely unaware of their familial relationship.<ref name=\"Galaxies\">{{GalaxiesAED}}</ref> Not everyone was pleased with the young Senator, however. Despite her first intimidating encounter with Palpatine, Leia became one of the leading voices of criticism towards the Emperor's policies.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> Being somewhat of a political firebrand, her outraged sense of justice made some people feel threatened, while others viewed her as pathetically idealistic. [[Drost Elegin]], head of the Ancient House [[House Elegin/Legends|Elegin]] and a notorious playboy at Palpatine's court, mockingly called her \"Madame Senator\" and \"Little Miss Inalienable Rights.\"<ref name=\"Children of the Jedi\" />\n\nDuring the early stages of the Galactic Civil War, Leia aided Star Tours as a rebel front for ferrying Rebel spies. When [[Unidentified Rebel spy|one]] of the Rebel spies nearly ended up [[Raid at Spaceport THX1138|captured]] at [[Spaceport THX1138]], Leia gave a transmission to the escaped ''StarSpeeder 1000'' carrying the spy to go to the rendezvous point where the spy will be safely extracted by the Rebels.<ref name=\"ST2\">''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]''</ref> In addition, she eventually ended up getting a price on her head and was among the most wanted criminals in the galaxy.<ref name=\"ST2j\">''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]'' (Tokyo Disneyland)</ref>\n\n====Mission to Ralltiir and the Battle of Kattada====\n{{Quote|Please, your highness, put away your sorrow.

It was here that she discovered a wounded Rebel who possessed vital information on the Death Star. While in the process of rescuing him, Leia encountered the Moff of Ralltiir, [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Tion (Lord)/Legends|Tion]]. After getting the information, Leia rescued the Rebel. Later, Leia killed Tion in self-defense, making her an enemy of the Empire. After discovering the Imperial superweapon, Rebel [[Spy/Legends|spies]] were able to steal the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star's]] blueprints, sending them to the Rebel Alliance before being killed.<ref name=\"PrincessWarrior\" />\n\n[[File:LeiaAtlas.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Leia during the Battle of Kattada]]\nFollowing the trip to Ralltiir where they retrieved the Ralltiir rebel, [[Basso]], Princess Leia and her uncle Raymus Antilles traveled on the ''Tantive IV'' to Kattada's main space port in [[Haleoda]]. Upon arriving, they were greeted by Haleoda's ruler Madam [[Mia Ikova]], a sympathizer of the Rebel Alliance, who agreed to help deliver supplies to the rebels on Ralltiir. Later, at the spaceport, Leia and Mia Ikova received word from a messenger that an Imperial patrol ship was landing. By then, Leia and her crew had realized that it was too late to escape and that they could not leave Mia Ikova and her people to deal with the Empire alone. The Imperial Landing craft landed directly beside the Tantive IV, and both sides opened fire. Shortly after, a force of stormtroopers and [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout troopers]] departed from the landed on the planet under the command of Commander [[Karg]], who announced that all who were present were under arrest in the name of Emperor Palpatine. After refusing to surrender Karg ordered his legion of stormtroopers to shoot, injuring Mia.<ref name=\"PrincessWarrior\" />\n\nEnraged at her refusal to surrender, Karg attempted to shoot Leia. Luckily, Leia was saved when the ''Tantive IV'' turbolaser turret opened fire on Karg, wounding him severely. The ''Tantive IV''{{'s}} crew then retrieved Leia, Ikova and Karg and brought them to the medical bay. Unfortunately, Mia wasn't able to overcome her injuries and died. Leia blamed herself for what had happened and wished she had never come to Kattada. Ikova's father responded by reminding Leia that she had come to seek help for the rebels on Ralltiir who needed their aid badly and that she should not let what had occurred sway her from her purpose, before presumably dying. Later, Organa lead a ground assault, successfully neutralizing the imperial threat on the planet. Following the battle, Leia left for Alderaan on the ''Tantive IV'' after saying farewell to her Kattadan allies.<ref name=\"PrincessWarrior\" />\n\nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Kattada]], Organa was contacted by her father, giving her an important mission to track down [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and bring him to Alderaan.

She was secretly on a rebel mission above Tatooine to find Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and return him to Alderaan, although she simply stated she was a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan. After a skirmish between the star destroyer and ''Tantive IV'', the rebel ship's reactor was damaged, and Darth Vader boarded the ship through the main hangar of his star destroyer after pulling in the damaged ship with a tractor beam. The [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] sought to recover the plans for the Death Star I.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nUnknown to Vader, the young senator had hidden the plans inside an [[Astromech droid/Legends|R2 unit]], [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], and sent the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] to find the legendary Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet Tatooine. Leia attempted to hide from the stormtroopers in her ship, but was found and stunned after shooting one of them with her sporting blaster. She was cuffed and brought before Lord Vader, who accused her of [[Treason/Legends|treason]], although Leia untruthfully denied any connection with the Alliance.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nVader brought her to the Death Star I, where he personally interrogated and tortured her, seeking the location of the plans and the hidden Rebel base from which the Empire suspected the Alliance was striking. Remarkably, she managed to keep silent, despite Vader's [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] powers and the use of an [[Interrogation droid/Legends|interrogation droid]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> In an interrogation cell, she was able to resist punishment and refrain from revealing the base's location.\n\n[[File:LeiaOrganaTorture-JvS.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Darth Vader interrogates Princess Leia.]]\nWilhuff Tarkin, Leia's old acquaintance<ref name=\"The Princess Leia Diaries\" /> and now a [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]], threatened Organa with the destruction of her homeworld, Alderaan, if she did not reveal the location of the Rebel base. She lied, giving them instead the location of a long-since abandoned base on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. Tarkin proceeded with the destruction of Alderaan regardless, saying Dantooine was too desolate and sparsely populated to make a suitable demonstration of the superweapon's power; this was one of the most infamous acts of the Empire and a shocking example of the [[Tarkin Doctrine/Legends|Tarkin Doctrine]] of rule by terror. Leia was then placed in a holding cell and scheduled to be executed, while the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] deployed scout craft to investigate [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nPrincess Organa's message had reached Obi-Wan Kenobi by this time, and he set out from Tatooine with Luke Skywalker, intending to bring R2-D2 to Leia on Alderaan. Kenobi had hired [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] as a pilot. Arriving in the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]] shortly after the world's destruction, the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] was captured by the Death Star's [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]], while the station was still positioned in the system.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nSurprisingly, this small group managed to avoid immediate capture. Finding that Organa was on the station, they set out to [[Rescue of Princess Leia/Legends|rescue]] her. Killing a number of stormtroopers they succeeded in rescuing Leia. Tarkin had by this point discovered that Dantooine was indeed abandoned. In order to find the true location of the hidden base, he ordered his soldiers to allow the small band to escape with Leia, after planting a tracking device on the ''Falcon''. Darth Vader, meanwhile, set out to find Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom he later killed in a duel.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nThe Princess ran with the band of rescuers, traveling along a large portion of the station to try to locate the ''Millennium Falcon''. They found the ship, and, using Obi-Wan's duel with Vader as a distraction, escaped the station, thanks to Obi-Wan disabling the tractor beam. Organa realized that her escape must have been deliberately permitted by the Empire, and surmised that the ship was being tracked. However, she nonetheless decided to return to the [[Great Temple/Legends|base]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Leiadeathstar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leia on the Death Star I with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo]]\nPresumably, she would have been arrested immediately had she tried to land on any inhabited Imperial world, and finding another place to trade ships would have been complicated and dangerous. (Locating the tracking device would have been virtually impossible, given how small such a device could be.) This was a risk, of course: if no weakness could be found, or if the discovered weakness could only be exploited by, for instance, a saboteur on board the Death Star, it would be necessary to stage a massive evacuation.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nReturning to Yavin 4, Princess Organa found that her gamble had paid off, as the plans did in fact reveal a weakness that [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] could potentially exploit: a small exhaust vent in the polar trench. The rebel Alliance readied their fighters, and, receiving Instructions from Leia, readied for what would be known as the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], a major turning point in galactic history, and the event the new date system for the galaxy was based on. During the battle, the Death Star was destroyed by Organa's twin brother, Luke Skywalker (although this familial relationship was unknown by both twins at this time) after two runs attempting to hit the vent. This marked a turning point for the Rebellion.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nFollowing the Rebel victory at the Battle of Yavin, Leia held a public ceremony, rewarding Luke Skywalker and Han Solo for their accomplishments and heroism during the battle.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Following the ceremony, Leia joined in the following celebration and gave Han a kiss.

She, along with Luke, raced out to catch him, but he rocketed away in the ''Millennium Falcon'' just as they got to the temple. Furious, she denounced Solo, despite his efforts at the major battle, and issued a warrant for his arrest, should he return to Yavin 4. When he ''did'' return, she found out that the treasure was sold to finance the Alliance, and she forgave him. Subsequently, she went with him on a mission to the [[Incom Factory]] to negotiate the purchase of new X-wings with [[Vors Voorhorian]].<ref name=\"X-Wing Marks the Spot\">{{Kids1997Cite|issue1=6|issue2=10|story=X-Wing Marks the Spot}}</ref>\n\nA week after the Battle of Yavin, Leia, R2-D2, and Luke traveled to Rebel base of [[Akuria II]] to insure against a sudden Imperial counter-attack on Yavin. But because Artoo wasn't properly repaired the ship went off course. After a near-miss with an Imperial fleet, Organa and Skywalker encountered four android children, who had the power to control the elements, and a computerized \"[[The Keeper|Keeper]]\" on a formerly war-torn world who helped them to escape the Imperials.<ref name=\"The Keeper's World\">''[[The Keeper's World]]''</ref>\n\nWhen the Galactic Empire destroyed Alderaan the Rebellion lost a lot of its funds. Therefore, Jan Dodonna sent Leia to [[Muunilinst/Legends|Muunilinst]] where she should meet the [[Muun/Legends|Muun]] [[Mak Luunim]]. That Muun had codes for some secret accounts of the Rebellion and although Leia wanted to travel to some survivors of Alderaans destruction by [[Delaya/Legends|Delaya]] she agreed to the mission. Together with Luke, Chewbacca, Han and the droids she flew to Muunilinst but they were attacked by an imperial TIE fighter before they could meet Mak Luunim. In the fight an unknown pilot came to their aid and adjacent he crashed on a moon. Leia and the others found his empty fighter and by the searching of him they met a [[Reek/Legends|reek]] which Luke could beat. After that they discovered the pilot in a cave where they were attacked a second time by a reek and Han shot with his blaster for their defense so that they were surrounded in the cave. Only Luke could disburden them and with the Falcon the group and the pilot who said that his name had been [[X-7|Tobin Elad]] could leave the moon. Because he told Leia that he had been a warrior who had lost his home and family she got some sympathy for him. They took him with them to Muunilinst nevertheless Han and Leia weren't sure whether they could trust him. On Muunilinst Luke must drive a race for the Muun [[Nal Kenuun]] so that he gave him the codes of the Rebellion which he took after the death of Mak Luunim. Without the others Leia and Luke made an emergency plan and before the race began the two seemed to have a controversy. Leia left the group and appropriate the [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]] [[Urgiluu]] of Nal Kenuum. So she had a pressurizing and could change the freedom of the group against the dragon when Kenuum wanted to get the head money of Han and Tobin. With the codes of the Rebellion they went back.<ref name=\"Rebel Force: Target\">''[[Rebel Force: Target]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Rally_Point.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leia directing a Rebel briefing]]\nAgainst Luke's better judgment, Leia sought the help of [[Raal Panteer]], a childhood friend from Alderaan, in finding a new location for the Rebel base. Raal did not care for the Rebellion much, though he did care for Leia, and proposed that she stay on the moon with him and together they could preserve a bit of Alderaan together. When Leia accompanied Raal on a tour through the wild preserve, they crash-landed on planet where Panteer was bitten by a creature and died. Enraged [[Heeth Panteer|Heeth]] ordered Leia to leave the planet, refusing to help the Rebellion.<ref name=\"A Little Piece of Home\" />\n\nShortly after the loss of their base on Yavin 4, Leia, [[Nera Dantels]], and [[Jorin Sol]] accompanied Luke to [[Jabiim/Legends|Jabiim]] where they discovered that the locals had a personal vendetta against Anakin Skywalker after he abandoned them to the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. They were captured by the natives shortly after. Having managed an escape from the rebel group who wanted revenge for their father's actions during the Clone Wars, Leia, Luke, and the droids fought their way through Imperial stormtroopers and encountered [[Nolan Gillmunn]], a local resistance leader and son of [[Orliss Gillmunn]]. Becoming allied with Nolan and his band of rebels, Organa and the others participated in the [[subjugation of Jabiim]].<ref name=\"In the Shadows of Their Fathers\">''[[Star Wars: Empire: In the Shadows of Their Fathers]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]] Organa traveled to [[Metalorn/Legends|Metalorn]] on a mission to spread the message of hope to its residents. Metalorn, a factory planet, had been controlled by the Empire, under the direction of [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Corwyth]] with no information of the Rebellion reaching its citizens. Leia managed to evade Imperial stormtroopers long enough to contact her former instructor Arn Horada in order for him to spread the word that the Rebel Alliance actively opposed the Empire's tyranny. Soon after Organa was confronted by [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Orman Tagge/Legends|Orman Tagge]] before she was able to establish any details, but managed to escape with the help of a youngster named [[Tammia Hollusen|Tammi]].<ref name=\"A Princess Alone\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_Organa.jpg|thumb|left|Leia directing Alliance troops]]\nA short time later, she was [[Mission to Bedlam|forced]] to land on [[Bedlam/Legends|Bedlam]] while escaping from Imperial forces. While running from Imperial stormtroopers, Leia tripped over a stormtrooper helmet, twisting her ankle. She soon discovered the remains of Imperial stormtroopers she'd tripped over seemed to have been lying there for thousands of years. Spotting Imperial forces closing in on her, Leia decided to keep moving despite her injured ankle. She then met four [[Bedlam Spirits]]&mdash;[[Tilotny]], [[Horliss-Horliss]], [[Cold Danda Sine]] and [[Splendid Ap]]&mdash;and [[three stormtroopers]]. The Spirits, curious about the \"tiny movers,\" decided to play with them. Tilotny turned one stormtrooper into a [[Diamond/Legends|diamond]] and then transformed Leia's [[Heart/Legends|heart]] into a diamond as well, killing her instantly. Meanwhile, Tilotny killed the remaining stormtroopers and ordered Splendid Ap to clean the mess. He resurrected Leia and the stormtroopers, but [[Time travel/Legends|placed]] the latter [[8000 BBY|8,000 years in the past]]. After regaining consciousness, Leia somehow managed to return to Yavin base.<ref name=\"Tilotny\" />\n\nDuring the time period shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Leia was assigned to go [[Shelkonwa]] to meet with an [[Adarian/Legends|Adarian]] named [[Yeeru Chivkyrie]] to see if she could integrate three separate Adarian groups into the Rebel Alliance. Originally, Luke and Han were going to go with her, but a series of pirate attacks on their supply lines caused the Alliance to send them to investigate, and Han's attention had been annoying her anyway. She would later regret that decision, though. Arriving on Shelkonwa, Leia met with the leaders of the resistance groups, and later with [[Administrator/Legends|Administrator]] [[Vilim Disra]], who she had been told wanted to seek to join the Alliance. However, Disra, upon seeing her, double-crossed them, locking down the spaceports and starting a search for her. Leia took cover in a small lower-income neighborhood, posing as a tapcafe waitress. While there, she foiled a burglary attempt on a nearby tenement, causing the local populace to not tell patrollers of her presence. Eventually, Vader and the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] arrived in search of her, but Han, Luke, and Chewie arrived on Shelkonwa, having heard that she was in trouble. Using an ISB freighter that had been appropriated by the [[Hand of Judgment]], who were working with Han, Luke, and Chewie, they made their way back to the ''Falcon'', where the Rebels and rogue stormtroopers parted ways.<ref name=\"Allegiance\">[[Allegiance (novel)|''Allegiance'']]</ref>\n\nWith Organa now exposed as a Rebel, she took over the Alliance's diplomatic efforts.

On Mimban, Leia and Luke encountered [[Halla]], a Force-sensitive. They struck a deal with her, promising to find the [[Kaiburr crystal]] if she aided in their escape. During their search, Leia and Luke confronted Darth Vader. Darth Vader managed to injure Skywalker and would have killed him if it weren't for Leia. Using [[Anakin Skywalker's second lightsaber/Legends|Luke's lightsaber]], Leia briefly dueled the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] and while had been able to strike a [[Shiim/Legends|glancing blow]] on him, she was quickly defeated due to her inexperience with the weapon.

Leia helped establishing [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base]] since it was but a small outpost. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Luke went missing while on a patrol. Worried, Organa sent Han to look for him. Fortunately Han returned with an unconscious and badly injured Skywalker in tow. Luke was immediately put into a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]] and recovered from his encounter with a [[Wampa/Legends|wampa]]. When Han confronted Leia on the issue of their relationship, an incensed Organa kissed Luke, causing a love triangle between the three friends.<ref name=\"Episode V\">{{Film|V}}</ref>\n\nAdmiral Ozzel, the Imperial officer directing Lord Vader's fleet, used probe droids to find the Rebel base, although at the time, he thought they were smugglers. When Vader confirmed that it was indeed the rebel base, he ordered a full-scale attack. Discovering that the Alliance was at risk, Organa helped coordinate the evacuation of the Rebel base from Hoth. Transports were launched to take members to other bases, accompanied by fighters and ground-based ion cannons. Snowspeeder squadrons and infantry were deployed to hold off incoming Imperial [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-ATs]]. However, the attacking forces penetrated the rebel base, and damaged it substantially. Despite the ongoing [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|battle]], she remained composed and issued commands from the crumbling base. Luckily, she was able to escape any danger and flee with [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], Han Solo and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] on the ''Millennium Falcon'', left with no other option but to accompany them due to a cave-in caused by the bombardment blocking the path to the transports. Pursued by Imperial fighters, and hobbled by a non-functional [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]], they escaped by flying into an asteroid field.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n====Crisis at Cloud City====\n{{Quote|You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us here in the clouds.|Lando Calrissian|<ref name=\"Episode V\" />}}\n[[File:Leia19.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leia senses Luke's distress.]]\nPrincess Organa's initially adversarial relationship with Han Solo around this time evolved into a more romantic one. In the asteroid field, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia landed in a tunnel on a small asteroid, attempting to repair the damaged hyperdrive of the ''Millennium Falcon''. The trio did not realize that the tunnel was in reality the throat of a fabled [[Exogorth/Legends|space slug]], but escaped just in time. They then tried to find a system near enough to reach; they make their way to [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]].\n\nNot long after their escape from Hoth, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and Threepio went to [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], then owned by Han's friend, [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], to get help with the ''Falcon''. Soon after they landed, on platform 327, Cloud City officials came to greet them, but the group does not know that they only allowed them onto the system because the Imperial bounty hunter, [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] was present searching for the escaped rebels, and had followed them. C-3PO went missing, and Lando took them in for breakfast, only for the trio to find that Darth Vader and his stormtroopers were lying in wait. Han was soon tortured and Leia and the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] were thrown in the dungeon. Moments later Lando came to the dungeons to tell the group that he did what he needed to and informed them of Vader's trap for Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nSolo was then used as a test subject for the [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]]-freezing process, which Darth Vader intended for Luke Skywalker (Solo survived the freezing process, and was taken to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]].) Before he was frozen, her parting words were \"I love you,\" to which Solo responded \"I know.\" ({{Audio|ILoveYouIKnow-ESB.ogg|Listen}}) After Han was frozen Leia unsuccessfully warned Luke of the incoming danger before being taken as Vader's prisoner. Lando then felt pity for the prisoners and escaped in the ''Millennium Falcon'' along with Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and the rediscovered C-3PO and R2.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nLeia displayed latent [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathy]], despite having never been trained in the use of the Force, when Luke reached out to her and she sensed his distress as he hung from a weather vane after being defeated by Darth Vader. She led the ''Falcon'' back to rescue him, and together they departed for a secret rendezvous point where the Rebel fleet was hiding.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n====Rescue of Han Solo====\n{{Main|Rescue of Han Solo/Legends}}\n{{Quote|Just relax for a moment.

However, they were unaware that Darth Vader and his entourage of paid assassins were also on the planet.<ref name=\"The Third Law\">[[Star Wars (1977) 48|''Star Wars'' (1977) 48]]</ref>\n\nVader's assassins made several attempts on Tardi's life, but Leia's quick wit not only saved the Viscount, but destroyed the assassins as well. Ultimately Vader was forced to play his hand and cut Tardi down with his lightsaber, only to discover that Viscount [[Tardi (droid)|Tardi]] was actually just a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] made in his image and the real Tardi had died months ago. Leia had R2-D2 record video images of the \"murder\" and transmitted them to C-3PO who was at police headquarters in order to prevent Vader from exposing their ruse to the authorities. Leia needed the fake Viscount to secure the loan, and used the [[Crown Jewels of Alderaan/Legends|Crown Jewels of Alderaan]] as indisputable collateral. As a precaution, Leia had to manipulate Vader into destroying the duplicate droid of Tardi.<ref name=\"The Third Law\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_Organa_-_SWGTCG.jpg|thumb|left|Leia Organa, ready for action]]\nUnbeknownst to Organa, Darth Vader had manipulated her as he really had no interest in preventing her financial deal for the starfighters; he only wanted to take possession of the priceless Alderaanian jewels. He bribed an officer at the local customs station and acquired the treasure, having only played along with Leia's plan to ensure he could leave the planet without the jewels being missed by the authorities. Nonetheless, Leia secured the funding for the starfighters.<ref name=\"The Third Law\" />\n\nIn the months that followed, Leia divided her time between missions for the Alliance and the search for Han. At one point, she was forced to stop the search as Skywalker was infected with a lethal disease called \"[[Crimson Forever]]\" after boarding an Imperial vessel, finding its crew members crimson-colored and dead. Suspecting a red-glowing stone aboard the ship to be the source of whatever killed the Imperials, Luke rushed back to the Rebel headquarters, but he was already infected. In a short time, Luke was lying comatose, his eyes turned scarlet red. Leia remembered a story Han Solo had told her about the [[Red Nebula/Legends|Red Nebula]] that featured a pair of stones similar to the one that infected Luke. Chewbacca regaled the tale, and the group came to the conclusion that the \"Crimson Forever\" stone was indeed one of those Chewbacca and Han had encountered&mdash;when the two stones were separated, they were extremely lethal. After summoning Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca to the Rebel base on [[Golrath/Legends|Golrath]], the trio set out in the ''Falcon'' and ventured to the Red Nebula. Leia and Lando boarded the vessel while Chewbacca waited in the Falcon and immediately saw victims of the \"Crimson Forever\". Convinced that it was nearby, they started looking for the second stone. Their search was cut short, however, when they were captured by a gang of bounty hunters employed by [[Domina Tagge/Legends|Domina Tagge]].<ref name=\"The Crimson Forever\">[[Star Wars (1977) 50|''Star Wars'' (1977) 50]]</ref>\n\nTagge explained that the stones were part of her plan to kill Luke Skywalker as revenge for the death of her brother, Orman Tagge, which Darth Vader had falsely accused Luke of being responsible for. She had hired the bounty hunters to retrieve the stones once word of the deadliness of the red-glowing rocks reached her. Bombing the planet where the stones had been held, she soon had them in her grasp. Shortly afterwards, an Imperial warship loaded with Imperial stormtroopers boarded the Nebula unaware that Tagge had tinkered with the canister of their stone, making it burst open when it was placed under the pressure of hyperspace travel. Tagge managed to coax them into leaving by revealing the location of the Rebel base on Golrath. By the time they arrived near Golrath, they were all dead, and the ghost ship trap was set for Skywalker. However, priest, one of Tagge's prisoners, released the stone in Tagge's ship from its canister as well, killing many. Domina and a few bounty hunters were able to seal themselves away on the ship, avoiding certain death, but lacking space suits to shield themselves from the disease, they were trapped.<ref name=\"The Crimson Forever\" />\n\nEscaping Tagge and her crew by jumping through an airlock, Leia and Lando were picked up by the ''Falcon''. Realizing that they needed the stone to cure Luke, Leia struck a deal with Domina&mdash;the Rebels would save her and her bounty hunters from the \"Crimson Forever\"-infested ship, and in return, she would hand over her stone so they could stop the plague. As the crystals were reunited on Golrath, Luke was cured. Domina and her accomplices flew off in an escape ship per the agreement, and the stones were loaded aboard the Imperial ghost ship, which was sent straight into Golrath's sun. The Rebel base, however, was destroyed by Leia to avoid discovery by the Empire.<ref name=\"The Crimson Forever\" />\n\n[[File:LeiaFightsDirty-SOTETC.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Leia knees Prince Xizor in the groin.]]\nShortly afterwards, Leia and Captain [[Chedaki]] went to investigate Imperial activity in the [[Shiva system]], but as the two entered a shuttle to go down to the planet [[Shiva IV]], the ship was damaged by a [[Space mine/Legends|space mine]] that caused an explosion that killed Chedaki. Leia was forced to launch the damaged shuttle in order to protect the ship and the rest of the crew from harm.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\">[[Star Wars (1977) 53|''Star Wars'' (1977) 53]]</ref>\n\nThe shuttle crashed on Shiva IV, soon after Leia was immediately attacked by a savage raiding party. A group of natives led by [[Aron Peacebringer]] and [[K\u00e9ral Longknife]] repelled the raiders and rescued the princess. After her encounter with the raiding party Leia returned to the capital [[Illyriaq\u00fcm]] with Aron, and tried to warn him of the danger that the Galactic Empire posed, but the warlord was not convinced that such an empire existed. But during a gala of [[Calian]] nobility, Aron and Leia were both secretly captured by Imperial stormtroopers and brought before [[General/Legends|General]] [[Bentilais san Sk'ar|Sk'ar]] as prisoners.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" /> However, Leia and Aron escaped.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1977 54\">[[Star Wars (1977) 54|''Star Wars'' (1977) 54]]</ref>\n\nSome time later, Organa sought assistance from Prince [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]] of the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] criminal syndicate. In order to get past Imperial security, Organa was disguised as the [[Ubese/Legends|Ubese]] bounty hunter [[Boushh/Legends|Boushh]], and Chewbacca took on the identity of the Wookiee bounty hunter [[Snoova]]. From there the two became guests of Black Sun's leader, the [[Falleen/Legends|Falleen]] Prince Xizor. Xizor also became enamored of Organa, and attempted to seduce her. He used his pheromones upon her and was succeeding when he was interrupted by Chewbacca, who revealed Xizor's scheme to her. Upon returning to Xizor's presence, she stalled for time and then quickly rebuffed his advances by kneeing him in the groin, leaving an enraged Xizor who locked her up.

When she arrived at Jabba's Palace, she discovered two of the Alliances best pilots weere already present, the twin sisters [[Tia (pilot)|Tia]] and [[Ghia]]. The twins had been captured by Jabba after they abandoned the Rebellion in order to mount their own rescue for Solo and were enslaved by Jabba as punishment. Near the end of the tournament, she risked her own mission to rescue her fellow Rebels, and managed to get them off Tatooine and back to the Alliance on a [[GR-75 medium transport/Legends|transport ship]] right outside Jabba's Palace.<ref name=\"Demolition\">''[[Star Wars: Demolition]]''</ref> It was because of her participation in this tournament that she was able to perform the role of Chewbacca's captor in order to infiltrate Jabba's Palace. She played her role well, for the urging of more money led the Hutt to believe \"he\" was his kind of scum. However, in order to convince the ruthless Hutt, Organa coldly held an armed [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] ticking down its time until it blew unless Jabba agreed to a higher bounty. Chewbacca was sent to the dungeon while Organa remained in the palace.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nOnce Jabba's court had gone to sleep, Organa freed Solo from carbonite, only to be caught by Jabba. Han was thrown into a cell with Chewbacca.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Calrissian, disguised as one of Jabba's guards, tried to sneak away with Organa, but Jabba demanded she be brought to him instead.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi novelization\">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (novelization)|''Episode VI'' novel]]</ref> Organa warned the gangster that he would regret capturing her, but he ignored the threat and licked her face.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> He then ordered his dancers to remove her clothing and put a [[Huttese slave-girl costume]] on her while the [[Max Rebo Band/Legends|Max Rebo Band]] played music. Now a slave in Jabba's [[Jabba's criminal empire/Legends|court]], Organa was kept beside the Hutt using a metal chain.

While she assured him that she was alright, she also expressed her discomfort. Calrissian decided it would be unwise to make another escape attempt until Skywalker's arrival, though they both hoped he would appear soon. Organa admitted that she worried her safety would be in jeopardy if she had to dance for Jabba.<ref name=\"Return of the Jedi radio\">[[Return of the Jedi (radio)|''Return of the Jedi'' radio drama]]</ref>\n\nThe night after her capture, Jabba sent Organa to Boba Fett's room to entertain him. However, Fett was not interested in the enslaved princess and instead gave her a sheet to cover herself. Organa offered to pay the bounty hunter to help them escape, but he declined. The two then debated the morality of her friends and the Rebellion. Eventually, Fett grew tired of arguing with her and went to sleep. Organa was returned to Jabba the next morning.<ref name=\"The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett\">{{StoryCite|story=The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett|book=Tales of the Bounty Hunters}}</ref>\n\n[[File:JabbaLeia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leia during her enslavement to Jabba the Hutt.]]\nDuring Organa's enslavement, Jabba's [[Chef/Legends|chef]] [[Porcellus/Legends|Porcellus]] took pity on her and offered to sneak her food. He also prepared meals for Solo to help his recovery from hibernation sickness, earning Organa's thanks. However, Jabba became suspicious of Porcellus and accused the chef of putting [[fierfek]]&mdash;a hex&mdash;in his food. To help clear Porcellus's name, Organa ate a sample of the [[sandmaggot]] [[Kidney/Legends|kidneys]] he prepared for the Hutt. Unfortunately, the food was indigestible to humans and quickly made her nauseated, much to Jabba's amusement.<ref name=\"Taster's Choice\">{{StoryCite|story=Taster's Choice: The Tale of Jabba's Chef|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace}}</ref>\n\nAfter one of Jabba's late-night parties, Organa was sleeping alongside the Hutt on his [[Jabba the Hutt's dais/Legends|throne]] when Skywalker arrived to rescue everyone.<ref name=\"Sleight of Hand\">{{StoryCite|story=Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace}}</ref> They were awoken by the majordomo, [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna]], who was acting under the influence of Skywalker's mind-trick. Organa watched as Skywalker tried to bargain with her master, but Jabba refused to negotiate and dropped him into a pit with his pet [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]]. To Organa's relief, Skywalker killed the monster; however, a furious Jabba hassled her. In retaliation for killing his rancor, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca to be taken to the [[Great Pit of Carkoon/Legends|Great Pit of Carkoon]] and fed to the [[Sarlacc/Legends|sarlacc]]. Unlike her friends, Organa was to be kept alive and remain in Jabba's possession.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nJabba brought Organa with him on [[Khetanna/Legends|his sail barge]] to Carkoon, while her friends rode on a [[Bantha-II cargo skiff/Legends|skiff]]. During the ride, she was allowed to leave Jabba's side to watch her friends from a window. Eventually, Jabba wanted her back and started tugging on her chain. Annoyed, Organa glared at him and returned to watching. Jabba then pulled her chain harder, forcing her to run to him on his throne. The crime lord bragged that she would soon learn to appreciate him and made her drink with him.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:LeiaChokesJabba-ROTJ.png|thumb|left|180px|Leia strangling Jabba to death.]]\nWhen they reached the pit, Skywalker escaped once again and started attacking with his [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber/Legends|new lightsaber]]. As Jabba's guards fell into the sarlacc, Organa made her move. She crushed the light that lit up the barge and turned it into a pitch-black frenzy. As everyone was too preoccupied to help Jabba, Organa hopped over him and strangled him to death with the very chain that held her captive. R2-D2 then cut her chains and she joined Skywalker on the top deck of the sail barge.

[[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], alliance leader, and [[Gial Ackbar|Admiral Ackbar]] explained that the superweapon was protected by a deflector shield on the forest moon of Endor, and that while a strike team including Luke, Han, and Leia sabotaged the shield, a fighter team would penetrate the main reactor.\n\nSoon after Leia accompanied Luke and Han to Endor, using a stolen Imperial Shuttle to bypass the Super Star Destroyer Executor. On Endor, Leia and Luke confronted stormtroopers, attempted to ride speeder bikes back to an Imperial Base. In order to make sure their arrival was kept secret, Leia jumped on a [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]], with Luke in tow, and chased them throughout Endor's dense forests. Leia was able to shoot down one but was also shot down herself and collapsed. After falling off of her stolen speeder bike, she was found by a curious [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] named [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]], a local to the sanctuary moon of Endor.

Fortunately 3PO was able to persuade them to let Han, Luke, Chewbacca, and R2 go, with the help of Skywalker. Later on, the Ewoks accepted them as part of their tribe.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nThe night before the battle, Organa received news that forever changed her life. Her long-time \"friend\", Luke Skywalker, asked Leia if she remembered her biological mother. Leia explained that her mother had died when she was very young. Though she had some memory of her, they were only \"images\" and \"feelings.\" She recalled her mother as being \"very beautiful, kind, but sad\". Luke confided that he had no memory of his mother. He then revealed to her that they were brother and sister, and that the fallen [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Darth Vader, was their father. After Luke revealed to her of their relationship, Leia told Luke that she had somehow knew that Luke was her brother. When Luke told Leia that he had to confront Darth Vader, still stricken with shock, she tried to convince him to just \"run far away\" instead, but Luke had already made up his mind and left her deeply shocked.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_truth.png|thumb|right|250px|Leia learns the truth of her parentage.]]\nLeia fought alongside Han in the battle that followed, though she was injured with a blaster wound to her upper arm during the fighting. They were able to infiltrate the shield generator, but Imperial reinforcements arrived and they were captured. But with the help of Chewbacca and a tribe of ewok warriors, they managed to escape. Even with this injury, Leia was able to push down a stormtrooper with her foot and shoot two others who attempted to capture her and Han at the [[Endor shield generator bunker|shield bunker]]. The mission to Endor was eventually a success, and the Death Star II was destroyed in the epochal [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] when Lando Calrissian and [[Nien Nunb/Legends|Nien Nunb]], piloting the ''Millennium Falcon'', flew into the station's core and destroyed it from the inside.

Leia and Han Solo also struggled to find some time together and hash out their newly-formed relationship. Leia discovered that Bakura chafed under Imperial rule. The remaining Imperial forces were outnumbered and outgunned by Ssi-Ruuk invaders, and the result was a truce between the Imperials and the Rebels. While meeting with sympathetic [[Bakuran Senate]] officials, Leia was arrested for sedition by Imperial governor [[Wilek Nereus]] and was imprisoned in an out-of-the-way complex. She was rescued by a typically crazy stunt by Han Solo. Returning to orbit in the ''Falcon'', the Alliance forces helped beat back the Ssi-ruuk but were then betrayed by Nereus. As Han grimly prepared to ram the ''Falcon'' into an Imperial vessel to allow the other Rebels to escape, he ordered Leia to an escape pod, but she refused. Fortunately, Luke was able to convince the Imperial fleet commander [[Pter Thanas]] to surrender. Leia then aided the short, swift Bakuran overthrow of the government and was present at the surrender of Nereus. While on Bakura, the spirit of Anakin Skywalker appeared to Leia to beg for her forgiveness, which she would not, or could not grant at that time, since she had just learned of her parentage, and the fact that he was Darth Vader.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" /> Shortly afterwards, the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] was formed.<ref name=\"The Choice\" />\n\n====Nagai-Tof War====\n{{Quote|Run back to your friends, little Leia&hellip;but you have worse things to worry about than stormtroopers.

Almost immediately after Leia had pledged her support, she was thrust into an open conflict between [[Lumiya]]'s forces and the Herdessan Rebels. Personally leading a large group of Herdessan shocktroopers, Lumiya burst into the Rebel's base. Nearly all the Rebels were incapacitated by stun beams in the firefight, but Leia and the Herdessan resistance leader [[Suzu]] were able to escape from the battle.

Luckily, Suzu and Leia created a diversion that delayed the execution and allowed Leia to ambush Lumiya's guards. As Leia distracted the guards, Suzu released the rest of the prisoners and a final fight broke out between Lumiya's men and the now armed rebels. As the Rebels and the Imperial exchanged blaster fire, the remaining Herdessan citizens seized the opportunity to rise up against Lumiya and her corrupt allies. Attacking the Imperials from the rear, the Herdessan citizens quickly subdued their former oppressors and ended the battle.<ref name=\"Figurehead\" />\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] and the formation of a new government, certain members began to talk amongst themselves about the manner in which the leadership of the Alliance was run, claiming it was too oppressive. The leaders of the discontent parties gathered on [[Kabray]] to share their concerns with one another. [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] dispatched Princess Leia and Han Solo, along with four [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltrons]] as an escort, to the gathering to listen to their concerns and show them the leadership was not aloof, not deaf to their concerns.<ref name=\"No Zeltrons\">[[Star Wars (1977) 95|''Star Wars'' (1977) 95]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Nagai]] leadership targeted this gathering as an opportunity to disrupt the Alliance's diplomatic base and dispatched 13 Nagai warriors, led by [[Ozrei N'takkilomandrife|Knife]], to round up the non-combatants. The Nagai arrived before the Alliance reps and easily captured the party of diplomats. When Leia and Han finally arrived they walked right into a trap and were captured without a fight. While they tried to formulate a plan involving Leia pretending to faint, the Zeltron boys set their own trap. They hoisted [[Jahn]] up to the ceiling where he wedged himself in the corner above the door. When a Nagai guard entered the room, he jumped on him, knocking him to the ground. The remaining Zeltrons rushed out of the cell and attacked the remaining Nagai in a fierce brawl. Leia and Han appropriated blasters from downed Nagai and joined in on the fighting.

Her first New Republic position was [[Minister of State]], which she served as during the taking of Coruscant by the New Republic. Also, she served as Councilor during the [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] crisis. She went on to succeed [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] as its [[Chief of State (New Republic)/Legends|Chief of State]], and later filled other offices, such as [[Minister of Defense (New Republic)|Minister of Defense]], and various diplomatic posts. Although most of her life was devoted to such matters of state, she engaged in limited study of the Jedi arts, with her twin brother Luke Skywalker as her teacher. Notably, she wielded a [[Leia's lightsaber/Legends|blue-bladed lightsaber]] that she built herself, and then in [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]] Luke gave her a ruby-red lightsaber to complement the weapon she had constructed earlier. Because of her duties as leader of the New Republic, Leia became more of [[Jedi Consular]] than a [[Jedi Guardian/Legends|Jedi Guardian]].\n\n[[File:Leia-Zorbathehuttrevenge.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Leia in 5 ABY]]\nRight after the founding of the New Republic, the false [[Prophets of the Dark Side|Prophet of the Dark Side]] known as [[Rajah Ubooki|Kadann]] foretold that the chosen heir to the Galactic Empire would present himself bearing the glove of Darth Vader. An Imperial Grand Moff, [[Bertroff Hissa]], heard the prophecy and used it to proclaim Palpatine's son, [[Trioculus]], as the new Galactic Emperor. Now Emperor, Trioculus asked for Leia's hand in marriage. Leia accompanied her brother on his mission to locate the [[Glove of Darth Vader]], a rare gauntlet once owned by her father.<ref name=\"The Glove of Darth Vader\">''[[The Glove of Darth Vader]]''</ref>\n\nSometime after 5 ABY, [[Zorba Desilijic Tiure|Zorba the Hutt]] was set free from his prison holding cell, after his prison on [[Kip]] was infiltrated. He found out about his son Jabba's death and vowed revenge on Leia, Han, Luke and the others responsible. He had one of his hunters, [[Cobak]], kidnap Princess Leia, who was vacationing at the Fun World. Zorba, finally face-to-face with Leia, introduced himself as Jabba the Hutt's father, and vowed to take her to the Great Pit of Carkoon, where he would feed her to the Sarlacc. En route to Tatooine, the Zorba's Express was captured by the Imperial [[Moffship]], and both Leia and Zorba were captured. They dropped Zorba into the Pit, but he was spit out, and Leia got a low priority bounty on her head in the years to come.<ref name=\"Zorba the Hutt's Revenge\">''[[Zorba the Hutt's Revenge]]''</ref>\n\nSoon after, Leia was kidnapped by Kadann, who planned to turn her to the dark side and make her Queen of the Empire. Fortunately Leia was rescued and with her help, Luke and the others were able to find Palpatine's real son, [[Triclops]], and subdue Trioculus and Grand Moff Hissa.<ref name=\"Queen of the Empire\">''[[Queen of the Empire]]''</ref>\n\nAs the New Republic grew in size and legitimacy, Organa sat on its [[New Republic Provisional Council|Provisional Council]] as a representative from Alderaan. Her brother designed a regimen of Jedi training exercises for her, although she rarely found the time or the peace of mind to do them. While the military prepared itself for a conquest of Coruscant, Organa made attempts through numerous channels to contact the Imperial [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Zsinj]], including the Imperial [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] and several levels within Zsinj's own organization. Wanting to gauge how strong the New Republic was, Zsinj rebuffed her every time. With no permanent headquarters, the Provisional council convened on [[Noquivzor]] at the request of Senator [[Borsk Fey'lya]], holding a meeting that [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] was permitted to attend. Organa sought out Antilles after the meeting, and caught up with her old friend before being called away by Mon Mothma.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\">''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''</ref>\n\nCoruscant was soon after [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|taken by the New Republic]], and became the permanent headquarters for the previously mobile Provisional Council. As Councilor [[Sian Tevv/Legends|Sian Tevv]] had been exposed to the [[Krytos virus]], the council's meetings were punctuated by a light [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] mist circulating through the air. At one such meeting, Antilles appeared before the council, and pleaded with them to drop [[Trial of Tycho Celchu|murder charges]] leveled against [[Tycho Celchu/Legends|Tycho Celchu]] following the death of [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] pilot [[Corran Horn/Legends|Corran Horn]]. Remaining silent while he pled his case, Organa proposed a recess, and remained in the chamber with Antilles during the break, informing him that the spread of the Krytos Virus had nearly bankrupted a fragile New Republic, and that Celchu's trial had to proceed in order to keep public opinion of the government from collapsing. With the New Republic close to falling apart, Organa secretly headed to the [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]] in order to ask their [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|ruling Consortium]] for aid.<ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\">''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''</ref>\n\n====Disastrous courtship====\n[[File:Leia_wedding.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Leia during her wedding]]\nLeia, now busy with Minister of State duties while Han was away for a few months fighting [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Zsinj]], caused a significant rift between the two. During this time, Leia had been conducting negotiations with the [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|Hapes Consortium]] and was visited by the Hapes delegation at the time of Han's return. They presented Leia with a total of 63 different gifts&mdash;one from each Hapan world&mdash;including a [[Hapes/Legends|Hapan]] [[Gun of Command]], [[rainbow gem]]s from [[Gallinore]], a plant which promoted longevity and intelligence, several Star Destroyers, and last, the hand of the Hapes cluster ruler [[Ta'a Chume]]'s son, Prince [[Isolder]], in matrimony&mdash;which Leia seriously considered, as Isolder was handsome, well-mannered, and, most importantly, would provide both the New Republic and the Alderaanian exiles a great deal of benefit.<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" />\n\nJealous, Han kidnapped Leia and took her to [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]], a planet he had won in a high-stakes [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] game. During the flight, Leia was hostile and icy towards Han for abandoning his responsibilities. To make amends, Han promised to return and accept whatever punishment was deserved if she would spend a week with him and did not love him by the end. However, they found out that the planet was owned by Zsinj and were shot down onto Dathomir, which was interdicted. They encountered the [[Singing Mountain Clan]] of Dathomiri witches and set to work repairing the ''Millennium Falcon.'' They met up with Luke and Isolder, who had come to rescue them but were also trapped on the planet, and sparks flew between Han and Isolder again. However, the [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsisters]] had a plan to capture the ''Falcon'' and get off the planet, so Leia had to put all her effort into getting off the planet rather than over which man she should marry. Soon afterwards a battle broke out, which resulted in the end of Zsinj and his army and the marriage between Han Solo and Leia Organa.<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" />\n\n[[File:Han_Leia_Tatooine.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Leia and Han on Tatooine]]\n[[File:Tatooine_ghost_illustration_scene.jpg|thumb|Disguised Leia learning about her father's past as Anakin Skywalker]]\nAfter the near-disastrous courtship, Leia [[Marriage/Legends|married]] Han Solo in [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]]. Mon Mothma officiated the [[Wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa/Legends|wedding]].<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" /> To start their honeymoon, Han Solo took Leia to see the [[Corphelion Comets]] and even managed, albeit in a typical unorthodox manner, to get the romantic view all to themselves.<ref name=\"Corphelion Interlude\">{{StoryCite|story=Corphelion Interlude|book=A Forest Apart}}</ref> At first, she did not want to have children, as she feared they would turn out like her father, however she would soon discover the truth. Leia and Han, disguised with [[false prints]] and retina-concealing contact lenses as a blue-skinned Twi'lek and a red-skinned Devaronian respectively, went on an important [[Mission to Tatooine (Killik Twilight)|mission]] to Tatooine to retrieve the Alderaanian [[Moss painting/Legends|moss painting]] ''[[Killik Twilight]]'' and the [[Shadowcast]] key hidden within it. It was there that Leia came across her father's childhood friend [[Kitster Chanchani Banai|Kitster Banai]] in the [[Valley of the Spirits]]. With Banai's help, Leia discovered her grandmother's [[Holojournal/Legends|holojournal]] and the location of the moss painting. After speaking to Banai and another of her father's childhood friends, [[W. Wald|Wald]], and reading her grandmother [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|Shmi's]] diary, Leia discovered her father had not been born or raised as the evil monster she had known, and decided that there was nothing inherently evil in the Skywalker bloodline.<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\">''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''</ref> Soon afterwards, she became pregnant with twins.<ref name=\"Heir to the Empire\" />\n\n===Return of the Empire ([[9 ABY/Legends|9]]&ndash;[[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]])===\n====Thrawn campaign====\n{{Quote|They're up to something, Han&mdash;I can feel it.

C'baoth had planned to turn Leia and her brother Luke to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and make them his apprentices. To avoid capture she hid on the planet [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], but her would-be kidnappers tracked her and [[Mission to Kashyyyk (Thrawn campaign)|unsuccessfully tried to abduct her]].<ref name=\"Heir to the Empire\" /> She later learned that Darth Vader once landed on the Noghri home planet [[Honoghr/Legends|Honoghr]] and tricked the Noghri into serving the Empire by promising to help their planet recover from the ecological disaster that it suffered during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Because of this, they were fiercely loyal to Vader and later to Thrawn, his successor. The Noghri discovered Leia was the biological daughter of Darth Vader by her bloodline scent, and went to Honoghr and convince the Noghri of the Empire's deception. They left the service of the Empire and became allies of New Republic. Leia was addressed as \"The Lady Vader\" among the Noghri and both she and her family became revered figures in their society, to the point where Leia, known to the Noghri as the [[Mal'ary'ush]], or \"Daughter of the Savior\", was granted a permanent bodyguard of lethal Noghri warriors.<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising\">''[[Dark Force Rising]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:LeiaTwins.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Leia with the infant Solo twins]]\nAlso, during the Thrawn crisis, Leia gave birth to the twins [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]],<ref name=\"The Last Command\">''[[The Last Command]]''</ref> named after Han's [[Jaina (Elder)|mother]],<ref name=\"Routine\">{{Tales|2|Routine}}</ref> and [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] on Coruscant. Despite her pregnancy and later her newborn children, Leia continued to play a pivotal role in the fledgling New Republic as Thrawn's depredations threatened the security of the galaxy. Leia helped get [[Garm Bel Iblis/Legends|Garm Bel Iblis]] the command of Coruscant's defense forces after Thrawn laid siege to the planet and also helped root out the mysterious [[Delta Source]] that had given the Imperials so much vital intelligence. Finally, Leia helped procure the aid of [[Talon Karrde]] to the New Republic, authorizing payments to the smuggler to get his help and information. Karrde would later ask Han Solo, after Solo said it took Leia to bring him to the Alliance, if she had any sisters.<ref name=\"The Last Command\" /> During the later part of the Rebel Alliance and the early part of the New Republic, Princess Leia was highly popular among both the rank-and-file Alliance fighters and the leaders. After the twins were born, prior to the deaths of Thrawn and C'baoth, [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] agents staged one last unsuccessful attempt to apprehend Leia and the twins.\n\n====Return of Palpatine====\n{{Quote|Mom and Dad never act that weird unless they're worried about us three little darlings.''\"<br />\"''That's for sure.

After learning of Palpatine's return, Leia went to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] where she encountered the old Jedi, [[Vima-Da-Boda]], who told her the tale of her fall and bequeathed to Leia a box containing a [[Vima-Da-Boda's lightsaber|10,000 year old lightsaber]].<ref name=\"Dark Empire\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]''</ref>\n\nTraveling to [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] to rescue Luke with Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO, she got the four of them captured. Palpatine was quick to try taking advantage of this and attempted to turn her. Showing her the ancient Jedi [[Holocron/Legends|Holocron]] of [[Bodo Baas]] to tempt her, and stirring her anger by revealing that he intended to make her unborn child his next receptacle, his attempt backfired and Leia flipped over his bed and fled, stealing the Holocron. She then encountered Luke.<ref name=\"Dark Empire\" />\n\nLuke revealed that he had faked his turn and had been working to sabotage Palpatine's plans from the inside. Aiding in the escape of her, Han, Chewie and C-3PO, he sent R2-D2 back with them, having downloaded the master control codes for the World Devastators ravaging Mon Calamari into him. He then said that he would remain on Byss to attempt to assassinate the Emperor. After they fled, Luke went through with the attempt and failed.<ref name=\"Dark Empire\" />\n\nAfter the battle of Mon Calamari, Palpatine and a broken Luke arrived in his flagship, the [[Eclipse (Eclipse-class)|''Eclipse'']] at Pinnacle Base, where the New Republic was celebrating. While Leia was studying the Holocron in her quarters, the simulacrum of Bodo Baas told her a prophecy written by [[Bodo Baas's Master|his Master]], which foretold the [[Battle of Pinnacle Base|upcoming events]]. Palpatine demanded the presence of Leia and the return of the Holocron. Leia met with the Sith aboard the ''Eclipse''. Luke then implored for Leia's help in shaking off the Dark Side. Leia aided him and Luke managed to return to the light. Palpatine was enraged and engaged Luke in a brutal lightsaber duel. As Leia observed their duel, she gave energy to Luke through the use of [[Battle meditation/Legends|battle meditation]] and together they were able to subdue Palpatine. When Palpatine summoned a [[Force storm (wormhole)|Force storm]] against the New Republic fleet in retaliation, Luke and Leia summoned a wave of light side energy and enveloped Palpatine in it, cutting off his control of the storm. While the storm destroyed ''Eclipse'' and Palpatine, they fled.<ref name=\"Dark Empire\" />\n\n[[File:BodoBaasHolocron_EGTF.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Leia probes the [[Tedryn Holocron|holocron]] of Bodo Baas.]]\nAfter the death of Palpatine's clone on [[Byss/Legends|Byss]], Leia returned to Nar Shaddaa to remove Vima and extract from her knowledge of the [[Holocron/Legends|holocrons]] and the destroyed Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Dark Empire II\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire II]]''</ref>\n\nAfter fleeing to [[Nespis VIII]], Leia's second son was born and named [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]] after his grandfather Anakin Skywalker.<ref name=\"Dark Empire II\" /> Leia, who had been hesitant to tap into her Force potential, learned the valuable techniques from Vima, including how to shield the newborn Anakin. This skill allowed Leia to save him from being possessed by the spirit of Palpatine. With the reborn Palpatine's clone body rapidly deteriorating, she was forced to flee to [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] to hide Anakin Solo from him. The Emperor did eventually find her, but he was shot in the back, and a sacrifice from [[Empatojayos Brand]] saved them from Palpatine's spirit.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nLeia loved all three of her children dearly, but because of her position as Chief of State, she had barely enough time to devote to her family. As a result of kidnapping attempts, Leia sent the children to various safe worlds where they were put in the care of her most trusted friend, Winter. Though they were safe, the children, especially Jaina, missed her dearly. However, when they returned to their parents, the children viewed Leia as a stranger and wanted to believe that Winter was their mother. Jaina would begin to notice her distance from her family, leading to a big rift between them years later.\n\n[[File:Last_Clone_Body.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Palpatine's spirit tries to enter Anakin Solo.]]\nAlthough her sibling relationship to Luke Skywalker&mdash;and their relationship to Darth Vader&mdash;became public knowledge, she remained known as the heir to Bail Organa, and thus a member of the Royal House of Alderaan. She played an important role for those Alderaanians who still lived, having been offworld at the time of the planet's destruction. She founded [[New Alderaan/Legends|New Alderaan]], over which the Royal House of Alderaan, in the person of Leia Organa Solo and her children, continued to hold sovereignty.

Leia helped the Jedi students make plans to deal with Exar Kun to save Luke.<ref name=\"Champions of the Force\" />\n\nAlso during this time, [[Terpfen]] was being used by the Empire to locate Leia's youngest son on Anoth. During which she also had the twins with her and had to chose between the twins and Anakin.

Leia sought to the Force and found out that her son was still on the planet along with her best friend Winter, who had been exiled there. After she landed, Leia confronted the Admiral who was taking her child. She was very menacing toward him, although he had started to strangle her son. When the Admiral tripped, Terpfen grabbed the baby and handed him to Leia. Leia was so relieved, she could do nothing else but cry and rock her son.<ref name=\"Champions of the Force\" />\n\nMon Mothma's health began to decline that year. No one could discover the source of her illness until [[Terpfen]], Admiral Ackbar's chief mechanic, told her that the [[Carida/Legends|Caridan]] [[Ambassador/Legends|Ambassador]] [[Furgan]] had poisoned her.

Her new term of the Senate added several new ex-Imperial Senators and ex-Imperial worlds, such as the Senator for [[Exodeen/Legends|Exodeen]].

Leia accidentally left her brother behind after she rushed ahead not realizing that Luke was still weak. In those moments when they were apart, Kueller found Luke and forced a lightsaber duel. Leia came back to find both locked in combat. Terribly weakened, Luke abruptly decided to give up. As Kueller raised his lightsaber to strike Luke down, he lost his connection to the Force. Kueller tried to use his anger to tap into the Force, but doing so was useless, since a [[thernbee]] that had swallowed an [[Ysalamiri/Legends|ysalamir]] nutrient frame had wandered into the general vicinity. He had one last trick up his sleeve, though: he used a remote to send the signal to self-destruct his remaining droids. However, Kueller's last gasp of malice was thwarted thanks to the efforts of R2-D2, C-3PO, and young mechanic [[Cole Fardreamer]].

Sinisterly, Thrackan dropped the jamming field long enough to show Leia a hologram of him with her children in custody&mdash;to the immense outrage of the Selonians. The [[Overden]] immediately released the three just as Luke arrived and began planning a course of action. Meanwhile, Leia's youngest son Anakin managed to stop the destruction the [[Centerpoint Station]] was causing.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\">''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''</ref>\n\nDespite Leia's brave actions throughout the crisis, she received criticism for interfering in Corellia's attempt to achieve independence, prompting her to resign as Chief of State.<ref name=\"The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse\">*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''</ref>\n\n====Caamas Document Crisis====\n[[File:Leia-visionofthefuture.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Leia in 19 ABY]]\nDuring this time she became involved in the [[Caamas Document]] crisis in [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], in which Thrawn presumably came back from the dead. While on Wayland during a leave of absence from the position of Chief of State, Leia became entangled with a [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] who had found a datacard and wanted to keep it under the [[Debble Agreement]]. He claimed to be working for Talon Karrde, but did not recognize the smuggler chief. After offering to sell it to her for a ridiculous price, he threw a smoke grenade and tried to escape, but was caught and forced to land by the ''Wild Karrde''. That datacard turned out to reveal that Bothans had been involved in the attack on Caamas. She served as a Councilor on the [[New Republic High Council]] during the leave of absence. [[Ponc Gavrisom]] served as New Republic Chief of State during her leave.<ref name=\"Specter of the Past\">''[[Specter of the Past]]''</ref>\n\nLeia was also irritated to learn that Han had taken her place in negotiations between the [[Ishori]] and [[Diamal]]a, which he characteristically handled with his usual subtlety and diplomatic skill&mdash;next to none. Leia also visited [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]] with Han to investigate the Bothan Clans to try and find the names of the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothans]] involved as well as the financial well-being of the clans. During their stay, Han was blamed for a riot instigated by Imperial Intelligence and the Solos left the planet.<ref name=\"Specter of the Past\" />\n\nWhile still on her leave of absence to spend more time on her Jedi training, Han arranged a vacation to the sleepy [[Pakrik system]]. When traveling near the backwater world of [[Pakrik Minor]], the ''Millennium Falcon'' was attacked by assassins. However, they were rescued by a sleeper of cell of clones, including [[Carib Devist]], that Thrawn held left on Pakrik Minor. In exchange for their silence, they helped fix the ''Falcon'' and allowed Han and Leia to leave. Shortly afterwards, a shuttle containing [[Elegos A'Kla]] and [[Zakarisz Ghent|Ghent]] arrived with news that Admiral Pellaeon wanted to discuss a peace treaty. Leia immediately left with the Caamasi and Ghent, along with her Noghri bodyguard. Leia had successfully managed to discuss the treaty preliminarily with Pellaeon, but returned to find fleets of warships facing off over Bothawui.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\">''[[Vision of the Future]]''</ref>\n\nLeia was on board one of the Ishori ships in place around Bothawui as part of the hostile standoff over the planet when Imperial saboteurs successfully lowered the shield around [[Drev'starn]] and used a captured weapons cluster on one of the ships to bombard the planet. Then the Imperials lured each of the fleets into attacking the other. As full-scale battle threatened, Leia sensed danger and worry from Han in the ''Falcon'', who had been trapped by an Imperial Star Destroyer that was cloaked. She started moving the Ishori ship towards the threat, which absolutely incensed the Ishori captain. However, just as Leia was about to charged with mutiny under Ishori war-law, President Gavrisom stepped in and nationalized the warship using an obscure New Republic law. The Imperial ships, expecting to surprise the Rebels after the fleets had already battered each other, were surprised to find a united fleet attacking them led by Lando Calrissian, who Leia had selected.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" />\n\nAfter receiving the Caamas Document, Leia began talks with Admiral Pellaeon that led to [[Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty]] and an end to the Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" /> Once the Caamas Document crisis was dealt with, Leia, along with [[Mirax Terrik Horn]] and [[Iella Wessiri Antilles]], took some time off to help Mara Jade prepare for her wedding to Luke. Leia along with her family attended Luke's wedding on Coruscant, where she helped stop an assassination attempt.<ref name=\"Union\">''[[Star Wars: Union]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[21 ABY/Legends|21 ABY]] Leia Organa Solo was [[New Republic Presidential election, 21 ABY|elected]] back into office of Chief of State of the New Republic.<ref name=\"The New Essential Chronology\" />\n\nAll three of her children were trained as Jedi at Luke Skywalker's [[Jedi Praxeum]] from [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], and would defend the galaxy from the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]] as part of the [[New Jedi Order]]. In [[24 ABY/Legends|24 ABY]] Leia and her children, Jaina and Jacen, were able to stop the [[Diversity Alliance]], an anti-Human organization, from wreaking havoc. Unfortunately, Leia's role as Chief of State came to an end when [[Borsk Fey'lya]] succeeded her as the leader of the New Republic.\n\n===The Yuuzhan Vong War ([[25 ABY/Legends|25]]&ndash;[[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]])===\n====A new threat====\n[[File:Vonghutts.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Leia and Luke during the Yuuzhan Vong War]]\n{{Quote|The New Republic?

After the death of Chewbacca, Han blamed Anakin for Chewbacca's death and returned to the loner he once was, leaving the family to go on adventures with his friend [[Droma]]. Leia buried herself in her work with SELCORE, hoping that her husband would one day come back and mend the severed ties with their family.<ref name=\"Hero's Trial\" />\n\nA year later, during the [[Battle of Duro (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Duro]], Leia was captured by [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]], who tortured her to the brink of paralysis. Lah intended to sacrifice Leia to [[Yun-Yammka]], the God of War and the patron deity of the Warrior caste. Fortunately, Jacen managed to locate his mother and managed to knock Lah out a window, tearing the Warmaster's left foot loose. Shortly afterwards Han returned and rescued her.<ref name=\"Balance Point\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''</ref>\n\nAfter Duro was taken by the Yuuzhan Vong, Leia and Han fled to Corellia for Leia to recover. However, they were chased away by Han's cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo, now the Governor-General of the [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]]. They then decided to take a short break to try and close the rift in their marriage that was formed by Han's grief over Chewbacca. While on vacation, Leia and Han ran into a previously unknown group of Jedi called the [[Wild Knights]] which was lead by [[Saba Sebatyne]], and helped bring them to Luke's attention, and into the limelight of the war.<ref name=\"Recovery\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Recovery]]''</ref>\n\n====Death of a son and aftermath====\n[[File:LeiaJedi.gif|thumb|right|200px|Leia helps foil an assassination attempt on Borsk Fey'lya in [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]].]]\n{{Quote|You're a fighter, always have been.

Shortly afterwards, Leia's nephew [[Ben Skywalker]] was born, whom she adored and called \"Skycrawler.\" Other great changes in Leia's life were also taking shape: after having become more and more fed up with the New Republic politics and especially the [[Anti-Jedi sentiment/Legends|anti-Jedi sentiment]] prevailing in the Senate, she eventually made a decision to step out of political life entirely, feeling it was the direction the Force was guiding her to. Even though she had to compromise this decision in some occasions, she largely managed to lead a more low-profile life in the years to come.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\n[[File:Han-rebelstand.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Han and Leia during the Battle of Borleias]]\nPerhaps the greatest tragedy the Solos would face during the war came shortly afterwards, when on the doomed [[Mission to Myrkr]], Anakin died while leading a [[Myrkr strike team|Jedi team]] tasked with the destruction of the Jedi-hunting Yuuzhan Vong creations, the [[voxyn]].<ref name=\"Star by Star\" /> To make things worse, her eldest son Jacen was presumed lost as well after the other Jedi of the strike team felt his supposed death through the Force.

Still struggling with the overwhelming grief of her son's death, Leia&mdash;at the urging of Fey'lya&mdash;managed to make an impassioned plea to all New Republic forces to fight and resist at all costs.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" /> Meanwhile, Leia and Han gained temporary custody of their nephew as his parents were busy fighting the war. She enjoyed Ben's company but in some ways, she was reminded of her the son she had just lost. During the Fall of Coruscant, Leia was forced to turn Ben over to C-3PO as [[Viqi Shesh]] was planning to kidnap the infant. Fortunately, Lando was able to save both Threepio and baby Ben from harm's way.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" /> After Coruscant's fall, Han and Leia went to [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]] for Anakin's funeral.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\n====Aiding the war effort====\n{{Quote|I'm not a politician anymore, Han.

Leia and Han joined the [[Insiders]], and helped deliver the Myrkr strike team survivors to the Maw. Leia, convinced that Jacen was alive, nevertheless talked Han out of going to Coruscant to look for him, saying she needed him helping her with the Insiders.<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref> Returning to Borleias, Leia and Han were then sent on missions to sabotage Yuuzhan Vong activities. On one planet, Leia was forced to abandon a political associate in favor of a more pro-war candidate, and on [[Aphran IV]] she and Han were captured by local Peace Brigade-allied forces. Artoo and Threepio sprung them out of prison, and they continued on their way.<ref name=\"Rebel Stand\" />\n\nThough they were facing one of the most devastating wars in the galaxy, Leia and Han once again found hope when Jacen was indeed proven to be alive and returned from the Yuuzhan Vong captivity along with his mentor [[Vergere]].<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''</ref> Following the reunion with their older son, Leia and Han went on several missions to restore [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] communications in the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]], and foiled a second attempt of the [[Ssi-ruu]]k to invade [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]] in the process.<ref name=\"Refugee\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]''</ref>\n\nWhen [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]] made its existence known near Coruscant in [[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]], Han and Leia traveled there to be reunited with the rest of their family. There they met [[Harrar]], a Yuuzhan Vong [[Priest/Legends|priest]]. Solo also played a major role during the [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar]]. Leia and Han, along with Harrar, Threepio and Artoo, crashed the ''Millennium Falcon'' into the well of the [[World Brain]]. After the destruction of [[Shimrra Jamaane|Shimrra]] and [[Onimi]], Leia and the others traveled with [[Nom Anor]] across the labyrinth the mighty war vessel of the Master Shaper. However, the executor turned on them, shooting his venom at Han. Jacen managed to save him just in time. Before he could kill them off, Leia engaged Nom Anor, slicing off his hand in the process.

During the mission to Myrkr, Thul had been incapacitated by the Nightsister [[Lomi Plo]] and the Dark Jedi [[Welk]]. They took him and escaped on the ''[[Tachyon Flier]]'', which was under fire during Myrkr outbound, where all three were presumed lost. In truth, the ''Tachyon Flier'' had crashed onto the planet [[Yoggoy]], a Killik nest, and made all three Force-users into [[Joiner]]s. Raynar Thul was integrated into the Yoggoy nest while Lomi Plo and Welk were integrated into the [[Gorog]] nest. All became leaders of their respective nests, Raynar even created a new lead nest named [[Unu]] and became the [[Prime Unu]], now reborn as UnuThul. The Killik nests took on the persona of the people they integrated, or Joined into their nests. The Yoggoy nests, and each other nest, except for Gorog, gained Raynar's sense of compassion and value for life, whereas the Gorog nest retreated into secrecy, due to the want of Lomi Plo and Welk to hide. The Gorog became the Dark Nest, and secretly controlled the other nests, without their even knowing.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\nUnuThul greeted the Solos in Yoggoy hangar with a masterful display of his current Force power. In the [[Prime Chamber]], UnuThul used \"we\" to address himself, stating Raynar Thul no longer existed and \"they\" were now UnuThul. Luke insisted that he sensed Raynar's presence in UnuThul, and guessed Raynar might be in hiding. Raynar then guided the Jedi to read the [[Chronicle]] on the wall, explaining the transformation of Raynar Thul to UnuThul, and the rise of the Unu nest. UnuThul explained the Unu nest as \"the nest of the nests.\"<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\nIn the following interview Luke sensed the Raynar presence rose repeatedly to the surface but was swallowed by the presence of the hive mind. UnuThul claimed that the Crash was remembered, but not the Dark Jedi, and concluded that they must be dead. When Luke tried to probe UnuThul again, the hive mind was able to powerfully push Luke out. When Mara demanded the location of the missing Jedi, UnuThul suddenly Force probed Luke with such a power that required the combined strength of Luke, Mara, Saba and Leia to stop him.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\nStill refusing to surrender the location of [[Qoribu]], UnuThul stated that anyone could leave whenever they wanted, and decided to assign a Yoggoy guide to escort the Jedi back to Lizil. The Jedi soon realized that such a collective mind allowed UnuThul to spy on them almost anytime and anywhere on Yoggoy. They visited the crash site, and Leia received Jacen's [[flow-walking]] message about Qoribu which was in the [[Gyuel system]]. Insects dark blue in color then attempted to assassinate the Jedi Masters at the crash site, which the Jedi barely escaped with [[Nanna]] killing several of the blue insects in the process. However, the Yoggoy guide that accompanied the Jedi denied ever seeing any blue insects before its death. When they traveled back to the hangar, Han and UnuThul exchanged harsh words on the matter of attempted assassination. As the debate became a stalemate, Luke proposed that it was another party who attempted to assassinate the Jedi, but UnuThul insisted that even if someone else attacked the Jedi, the hive mind would also be aware. To avoid a war with the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]], Leia suggested to UnuThul that the Killik nest be moved to a new planet, but made him think it was his idea.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\nAfterwards, Leia decided to formally join the New Jedi Order. Luke and the other Masters initially thought that she meant she was ready to take her place, as in their minds her long history of service to the Force was enough to grant her such a status without question. Instead, Leia insisted that she wanted to earn her place in the order rather than simply be accepted in as the daughter of Anakin and sister of Luke, asking Saba Sebatyne to train her. The [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] found the idea highly amusing for several seconds, until she realized Leia was completely serious. The former senator, resistance fighter, and head of a galactic government now wanted Saba to challenge her in \"new and unexpected ways.\"<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\nAlthough skeptical at first, Saba took Leia as her apprentice and treated her more or less as any other Jedi she would train. Which was, in fact, more uncomfortable for the Masters of the Jedi Order than Leia, since more than a few had spent their adult lives taking orders from her and were very close friends. More than once, Saba was forced to remind Leia not to be so familiar with the Masters to the simultaneous amusement and embarrassment of all concerned. However, the results were astonishing as the second child of Anakin Skywalker finally started to reach her true potential in the Force.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\n====Swarm War====\n[[File:LeiaOlder.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leia, now a Jedi apprentice]]\n{{Quote|You're too old to start being a real Jedi now.''\"<br />\"''I think I need to teach you some manners.|Alema Rar and Leia Organa Solo|<ref name=\"The Unseen Queen\">''[[Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen]]''</ref>}}\nJust prior to the [[Swarm War]], Luke and Han had been taken prisoner by the Killiks in order to gain help for stopping the [[Fizz (acid)|Fizz]]. Upon returning from Ossus with Master Saba, as well as Mara Jade Skywalker and a team of Jedi in [[StealthX]]'s, Leia was captured by Admiral [[Nek Bwua'tu]], commander of the 5th Fleet, stationed in the [[Utegetu Nebula/Legends|Utegetu Nebula]] to prevent the Killiks from leaving their homeworlds. While arguing with the Admiral aboard the ''Admiral Ackbar'', the Killiks attacked the ship. Led by [[Alema Rar]], the Killiks managed to take over the ship, with Leia fighting Rar to a standstill before escaping, just as Han and Luke returned from Utegetu.<ref name=\"The Unseen Queen\" />\n\nAround this same time, R2-D2 had a malfunction where he had shown Luke a holoclip of the mother he had never known. Before Luke could get more out info out of Artoo, Artoo had a meltdown, claiming he was protecting Luke. Frustrated, Luke contacted master [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] Zakarisz Ghent, who managed to recover one other holo featuring [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], which was displayed to both Luke and Leia.<ref name=\"The Unseen Queen\" />\n\nLeia did not approve when Luke took complete control of the Jedi Order. During the [[Conclave on Ossus|Jedi convocation]] at [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]], she and Han discovered that [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]] had recently given birth to a daughter [[Allana Djo Solo|Allana]], whom she did not know was her granddaughter through her son Jacen, though she did suspect Jacen knew who the father was. She later went off with Han forsaking the Order to search for their daughter Jaina in the Unknown Regions. They were detained many times, but eventually got to their destination.<ref name=\"The Swarm War\">''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]''</ref>\n\nOn [[Tenupe]], during the [[Swarm War]], Leia dueled for the third time with Dark Jedi Alema Rar. Saba observed this duel, and was very approving when Leia finally defeated Alema. In truth, the Dark Jedi was dragged off by a huge creature, one that Leia soon knocked off a cliff. The Chiss were less than happy with this explanation and lack of proof of Alema's demise, however.<ref name=\"The Swarm War\" />\n\nLeia then had her lightsaber taken by Saba, who told her that it did not reflect her skills anymore, and that it was time that she build a new lightsaber, one fit for a fully-fledged Jedi Knight.

However, she was secretly aiding the Corellian independence movement. She was present at the [[Battle of Tralus (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Tralus]]. Although she was a member of the Alliance fleet, she helped the Corellians to their victory. However, after the battle, Leia did not realize that her son Jacen had turned to the dark side.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nAs the war raged on Leia and Han found themselves banned from Corellia after Thrackan Sal-Solo placed a bounty on the entire Solo family. In order to avoid danger Han and Leia hid on Corellia, splitting up and meeting in Coronet. Getting useful information from [[Dur Gejjen]], Han decided that Thrackan was too dangerous to be left alive and decided that he should die, though he had doubts about killing him in cold blood. While on Corellia, Han and Leia learned of a terrorist attack on a hotel in Coruscant leading to the deaths of thousands. They did not approve when they learned that Jacen and Ben were leading [[Galactic Alliance Guard]] raids on the Corellian parts of Coruscant. After hearing the news Leia and Han decided it was time to face their son and left for Coruscant.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\nDuring their return to Coruscant, Leia and Jacen performed a [[Force-meld|Force meld]] in order to keep the aged ship intact. Soon after, Han, with the help of [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] and [[Mirta Gev]], killed Thrackan, thus ending his reign of terror. Meanwhile, Leia noticed that Jacen has become distant and was slowly becoming a stranger to the whole family. When Leia and Han discovered that Jacen killed [[Ailyn Vel]], Han disowned Jacen while Leia was stricken with shock and betrayal.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\n====Allegiance with Corellia====\nShortly afterwards, Leia, Han, and C-3PO were summoned to the [[Kiris Asteroid Cluster]] where the secret Corellian fleet was located. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by Wedge Antilles who was recently bestowed upon the rank of admiral. Han believed that he was summoned to help Antilles defeat the [[Blockade of Corellia]], but he was proven wrong once Dur Gejjen interfered. Instead of leading the attack with Wedge, Han and Leia were tasked with being decoys in order to draw Queen Mother Tenel Ka onto Corellia's side.<ref name=\"Tempest\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]''</ref>\n\nTraveling to Hapes in order to warn Tenel Ka of danger, Leia and Han learned that Gejjen had been using the Solos to disrupt Tenel Ka's security routine and draw her out into the open for an attack. In the process of warning her, Leia and Han unexpectedly walked into an assassination attempt on Tenel Ka by the [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Nashtah]]. Due to a series of unfortunate events, the two were forced to work with the assassin in order to escape. The three then set their course for [[Telkur Station]]. En route to the station, Leia and Han felt uncomfortable around Nashtah, though they insisted on finding the identity of the coup's leader. During their conversation, Nashtah revealed to Leia and Han that she'd seen Anakin Skywalker race in the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]]. It was then that Leia revealed the reason for having children, though Han was upset about revealing such information to a stranger. Leia also stated she would not allow Jacen to become a new Darth Vader after [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] (Nashtah's true identity) questioned her about Jacen's destiny.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nThey arrived on Telkur Station, only to encounter [[Jagged Fel]], who was presumed lost after the [[Battle of Tenupe]] during the Swarm War. During their conversation, Fel revealed that he was marooned on Tenupe for two years after being shot down by Leia. While on Tenupe, he had discovered that Alema Rar was still alive and seeking to kill Leia and her family in revenge for crippling her during their last duel. He also revealed that his family was going through financial troubles, causing him to become a bounty hunter. After the conversation, the three were drugged while Jagged slipped away.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nHan and Leia eventually escaped Sing, only to take another passenger by the name of [[Lalu Morwan]], who was responsible for hiring Sing to assassinate Tenel Ka and her young daughter. Due to Han's injuries he gained during their skirmish on Telkur Station, Leia was forced to fly the Falcon. Jacen ordered the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Anakin Solo (starship)|''Anakin Solo'']] to open fire upon the ''Millennium Falcon''. Han and Leia escaped the confrontation, though the ''Falcon''{{'s}} turrets and central core were destroyed by the turbolaser blasts, resulting in the deaths of the Solos' trusted Noghri bodyguards [[Cakhmaim]] and [[Meewalh]]. During the battle, Leia's nephew, Ben Skywalker, attempted to arrest Leia and Han for their supposed crimes against the Galactic Alliance. In an attempt to arrest the two, Ben accidentally slashed Zekk in the abdomen, severely injuring him. After making sure that Jaina, Zekk, Ben and his crewman escaped, Leia and Han escaped into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nWith the ''Falcon'' in desperate need for repair, Leia and Han traveled to a Tendrando Arms space station at Gyndine, where they reunited with their longtime friend, Lando Calrissian. Leaving Threepio behind to overlook the repairs, the trio left the planet in Lando's yacht, the ''[[Love Commander]]''. They managed to get through Corellia's security zone, partially due to their deceitful disguises and Leia's use of a Jedi mind trick.<ref name=\"Exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref>\n\n====Breaking from Corellia====\n[[File:Leia_FOTJdppdf.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Leia during the Second Galactic Civil War]]\nMeeting with [[Denjax Teppler]] in a Coronet cantina, they discovered that neither Teppler nor Wedge knew of the conspiracy to kill the Queen Mother and that it was the doing of Dur Gejjen. After their conversation, the group was forced to exit the cantina after several CorSec officers tracked Teppler to the cantina. Leia, Han, and Lando parted ways with Denjax shortly thereafter, being chased back to the ''Love Commander''. Only with the intervention of the ''[[Pulsar Skate]]'' and the ''[[Errant Venture/Legends|Errant Venture]]'' were Leia and the others able to defeat Corellian fighters attacking them. Aboard the ''Errant Venture'', Leia reunited with many of her friends and family. They also encountered the smuggler [[Uran Lavint]], who informed them of Alema's existence on the ship and the conference being held on [[Gilatter VIII]]. In an attempt to rescue Jacen from a violent ambush, Leia was once again confronted by Alema. The fierce duel that followed ended with a draw, with Alema crashing Lavint's ship, the ''[[Duracrud]]'', into the Errant Venture.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nUnbeknownst to her and Han, Jacen intended to make them his sacrifice for his ascension to Sith Lord; however, Mara's interference led Jacen to choose her as his sacrifice.

History just forgives them.|Leia and her son, now Darth Caedus|<ref name=\"Fury\" />}}\n[[File:Battle_of_Gilatter_VIII.jpg|thumb|left|Alema Rar engages Leia Organa Solo during the Battle of Gilatter VIII.]]\nLeia was scheduled to deliver the eulogy on Coruscant at the [[Funeral of Mara Jade Skywalker]], but a squad of GAG troops intercepted her and Han, despite Luke's guarantee of safe passage. They were forced to fight their way out and flee the Temple before reaching the funeral room, leaving Leia's master, Saba Sebatyne to eulogize Mara, as Han and Leia did not want Mara's funeral to become a firefight.<ref name=\"Inferno\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''</ref>\n\nInstead, they escaped Coruscant and went to Kashyyyk in an attempt to persuade the Wookiees not to side with the Galactic Alliance. However, GA Intelligence agents Jae Juun and Tarfang caused some interference with their efforts and Leia had to use the Force to seize the stone that gave its wielder the right to address the Wookiee council. About that time, Luke and the other Jedi, having broken with Jacen, arrived on Kashyyyk to assist them. However, Jacen was not far behind and began attacking the planet's forests, outraging both Han and Leia. In response, Luke, the newly arrived Jaina, and the other Jedi launched an [[Battle of Kashyyyk (Second Galactic Civil War)|attack]] on the ''Anakin Solo'' and its escorting Fifth Fleet in their StealthXs. Han and Leia, meanwhile, took off on the Falcon for the Hapes Cluster to meet with Hapan Queen Mother Tenel Ka.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\nUpon arriving at Hapes, through the Force, Leia sensed the disturbance caused by the explosion of Luke's fighter after Jaina, attempting to stop Jacen in his own StealthX from disrupting Luke's attack run, hit Luke's starfighter and destroyed it by accident. Leia was devastated by feeling her twin's death, but pulled herself together to face Tenel Ka, which was needed immediately to remove Hapan support from Jacen.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\nAs she and Han left the Falcon, they were ambushed by Tahiri Veila, who was one of the few Jedi still loyal to Jacen&mdash;though only because he had manipulated her love for his younger brother Anakin in order to control her and use her as a spy. Leia and Tahiri [[Duel in the Royal Hangar|fought]] viciously in the Hapan Royal Hangar, with Leia gaining the upper hand. It is likely that Leia would have killed Tahiri had Han not stopped her and Queen Mother Tenel Ka arrived. Tenel Ka sent Tahiri away for ambushing the Solos, giving her a \"Royal Guard Escort\" out of the Hapan system. Leia and Han were successful in persuading Tenel Ka to withdraw Hapan support of Jacen.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\nLater, Leia was in on a meeting between the Jedi, the Bothans and Confederate forces. She and Han had no opposition to the Bothan's statement that they were going to send assassins after Jacen, for they had realized earlier that their son was already dead - that this evil and wicked Jacen was not the one they had known all their lives. Leia could no longer feel \"Jacen\", or the boy that she had known as Jacen, in the Force; he had not been ripped away as Anakin had been, but a gradual disappearance that she had not noticed until he was gone.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\nLeia later attempted to plead with Jacen on renouncing the dark side, but he simply shut her out, refusing. In reality, Leia had not expected her pleas to work, she was merely distracting Jacen to provide time for Jaina, Han, Zekk and Jag to hack into the computers upon the ''Anakin Solo''. Later, Han and Leia used the knowledge obtained here to help rescue the [[Hapan]] Princess Allana, whom Jacen was hiding in secret quarters. While Luke, Ben, and Saba distracted Jacen by make a charge for the bridge, Han, Leia, and [[Iella Wessiri Antilles]] crawled through air vents to reach the young princess. After Allana was rescued, Han and Leia discovered that Allana was their granddaughter.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nAfter returning Allana to her mother on Hapes, Han and Leia traveled back to the Jedi outpost on [[Endor/Legends|Endor]]. Leia and her daughter Jaina met with [[Ben Skywalker]] to discuss his belief that Jacen had murdered his [[Mara Jade Skywalker|mother]]. He promised them that he would seek evidence to prove or disprove that Jacen killed Mara. Later Leia and Han were present on Endor when Ben received a recording from Lon Shevu that showed Jacen admitting to the murder, and revealing his new name of Darth Caedus.<ref name=\"Revelation\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nA short time later, the Jedi abandoned the base for an undisclosed world near the [[Transitory Mists]]. Leia and Han accompanied the Jedi, and were pleased that the location of the new base would give them additional opportunities to see their granddaughter. When the recording of Jacen confessing to be both the Sith Lord Darth Caedus and Mara Jade's killer was shown, Leia burst into tears and hugged Ben.<ref name=\"Revelation\" />\n\nFollowing Jaina's training under Boba Fett, she revealed to Han and Leia that she had to be the one to kill Jacen, now known as Darth Caedus. Jaina and her mother followed Ben discreetly to Monument Plaza while he met with one of his local contacts, Lon Shevu, a captain in the Galactic Alliance Guard. However, Shevu had been followed by Caedus's agents, including his apprentice Tahiri Veila. After Shevu was captured, Ben escaped away from the two Solos, trying to keep them from being discovered. Leia and Jaina attempted pursuit anyway after Veila captured Ben, but they were forced to break off the chase after Veila starting leading them into an obvious trap where they would be captured as well. Heart-stricken, they made their way back to their ship and returned to Shedu Maad to inform Luke Skywalker that they had lost his son. As they broke the news to him, Skywalker informed them that he had already foreseen that possible future and allowed it to happen anyway, for the sake of bringing down Caedus.<ref name=\"Invincible\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref>\n\nJaina embarked on a mission, dueling Caedus first on [[Nickel One]], and then encountering him on the ''Anakin Solo''. After a duel and being mortally wounded, Caedus stopped fighting so he could warn Tenel Ka about a threat to Allana. Jaina thought this to be a trick and killed him, horrified when she felt Jacen reaching out to Tenel Ka. Jaina then sat on the floor holding Caedus's head in her lap as Jagged Fel and her parents came to her aid. Han and Leia tried to avoid looking at their son's body but quickly broke into tears. Jaina would later say that she thought Caedus reaching out to Tenel Ka meant that he became Jacen before his death, and that she felt Jacen die through her twin bond, not Caedus.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nThough the Solos struggled to get through this hard time, they were able to remember Jacen as the kind young man he had once been, not the Sith he had turned into. The war had ended. Additional comfort and joy came from her granddaughter, Allana, whom Tenel Ka had given to Han and Leia to raise under the pseudonym Amelia because she knew that they could give the girl a safer life than she could on Hapes. Allana began training at the Jedi academy, though she ultimately left the academy to reside permanently with her grandparents.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\n===Picking up the pieces ([[43 ABY]]&ndash;)===\n====Sojourn====\nAt the conclusion of the war between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation, [[Natasi Daala]] was elected as the new Galactic Alliance [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]], and relations between the government and the Jedi Order proved tense. After Allana, still in the care of her grandparents and living under the alias of Amelia, discovered a strange object resembling an antiquated transponder aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', the Solos decided to track down the previous owners of the ship in the hopes of learning about it; as well as using the time as a means of escaping the tension of Coruscant. By this time, Leia had been planning on writing a multi-volume memoir of her life and the plan to seek out the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} origins inspired her to call the second volume ''The Crook, The Wook, and Me''.<ref name=\"Millennium Falcon\">[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']]</ref>\n\nHaving visited Lando, the Solos learned that the transponder remained active and appeared to have been installed sometime during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. In addition, Lando alerted Leia to an encounter he had with [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Seff Hellin]] on the planet of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], during which Hellin tried to commission a force of Mandalorian Hunter Droids for himself, as a means of combating Chief of State Daala's Mandalorian security forces. Unnerved by this, the Solos headed to Taris and encountered the rogue Jedi Knight themselves.<ref name=\"Millennium Falcon\" />\n\n[[File:Leia-fotj.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leia in 43.5 ABY]]\nAllana immediately noticed similarities between the way Jacen and Seff felt in the Force. Indeed, Seff interfered with an important Alliance operation, leading to a warrant for his arrest. However, using powers akin to those Jacen had been known to use, the rogue Jedi was able to escape his captors. Fearing the implications of this, Leia immediately contacted Luke, who also believed there to be a connection between Seff and Jacen. In addition, Seff's actions led to further discord between the Jedi and Chief Daala, who feared that Jacen had set a trend for younger Jedi turning to the dark side, forcing Luke to recall all Jedi to the Temple.<ref name=\"Millennium Falcon\" />\n\nThe Solos ultimately followed the transponder and the information provided by the ''Falcon''{{'s}} previous owners to a hidden Old Republic \"Insignia of Unity\" which had once adorned the Senate Building, though it proved to be nothing more than a simulacrum. En route back to Coruscant, Leia received a communication revealing that Luke had been arrested by Chief Daala for \"dereliction of duty\" and as such the Solos rushed to his aid.<ref name=\"Millennium Falcon\" />\n\n====Mission to Kessel====\nLuke ultimately gained his freedom by exiling himself from the Jedi Order and subsequently began a quest to learn what had lead to Jacen's fall to the dark side. In Luke's absence, [[Kenth Hamner]] was appointed Grand Master. Further complicating relations between the Order and the government, Jedi Knight [[Valin Horn]] began to exhibit similar behavior to Seff Hellin. Indeed, along with displaying a power possessed only by Jacen, Jedi Horn was adamant that every single person in his life had been replaced by a double. Both Leia and Han participated in the capture of the deranged Jedi, though it was Luke who ultimately stopped him.<ref name=\"Outcast\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref>\n\nThe Solos were soon contacted by Lando and were forced to aid him in saving the planet of [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] which had succumbed to violent earthquakes at the time Centerpoint Station was destroyed. Leia was instrumental throughout this, as her ability to use the Force proved an advantage. The Solos discovered a strange species of pure energy based beings living within Kessel, who monitored every gravity well in the galaxy, and who had begun to leave en masse; causing the earthquakes that wreaked across Kessel. Ultimately, however, the Solos and their allies proved able to save Kessel from destruction.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nLater, the Solos were summoned back to Coruscant by the Council in the aftermath of [[Jysella Horn]] succumbing to the [[Force psychosis|same psychosis]] as a her older brother and Seff Hellin. It had become obvious that this mental illness was not an isolated event, and Cilghal wished to discuss the behavior Seff Hellin had displayed during his earlier encounter with the Solos, lest it be important. [[Darkmeld]] had secretly captured the rogue Jedi, and Cilghal was carrying out tests in the hopes of finding a cure for the mysterious illness.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\n====Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition====\nAfter returning to Coruscant, Leia convinced Han that they should attend the [[Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition]] for a day, so as to provide an outing for Allana not fraught with danger, and to surprise her by purchasing a member of the animal species she gravitated towards most as a pet. It took several days for arrangements to be made for the Solo family to attend the event. Jaina accompanied her mother, father and niece to the event, while Jedi Knights [[Natua Wan]] and [[Radd Minker]] escorted them. Originally, Han and Leia had hoped that Jedi Knights [[Bazel Warv|Bazel \"Barv\" Warv]] and [[Yaqeel Saav'etu]] would be able to accept the assignment to escort them, as Allana was particularly fond of them, however, they were off world at the time.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\nThe small group first observed the animals in the outdoors exhibits, before moving on to the Small Animal Hall. In addition, the group made an effort to avoid [[Journalist/Legends|journalist]] [[Javis Tyrr]], who had consistently attacked the behavior of the Jedi on his Holoshow and had taken a particular interest in the activities of Jaina. It seemed the group was successful after entering the Dangerous Animal area at the insistence of Allana. Unfortunately, Javis Tyrr proved to be among the least of the group's worries.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\nIn the excitement, the Solos and Jedi Minker had failed to notice the disappearance of the [[Falleen/Legends|Falleen]] Jedi Natua Wan. However, Leia, Jaina and Radd Minker soon sensed a sudden disturbance in the Force, and after turning to find Natua missing, Leia immediately realized that she to had succumbed to the illness that plagued Seff Hellin, Valin and Jysella Horn. Wan proceeded to release the dangerous animals from their cages and retract the bridges leading to emergency exits, in the hopes of killing everyone inside; as, overcome by the mystery illness, she believed them to be \"impostors.\" In the ensuing chaos, Leia was forced to demonstrate her prowess as a Jedi by killing five [[Boar-wolf/Legends|boar-wolves]] to save a young child and a mother [[Nexu/Legends|nexu]] who had injured an Ithorian spectator.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\nAfter this, Wan proceeded to taunt Leia, who made her way to the control room expecting to confront her. However, despite Wan's voice emanating from there, she was nowhere to be found. Leia soon found Wan confronting Jaina, and aided her daughter in a brief lightsaber duel with the Falleen, before Jedi Minker head-butted the deranged Jedi, rendering her unconscious. Leia noted that Wan had demonstrated the ability to throw her voice using the Force, a strange ability her late son Jacen had also been known to possess. Wan's rampage proved particularly disastrous, as Javis Tyrr had managed to capture a large amount of the chaos on film and aided in souring the deteriorating relationship between the Jedi Order and the government of Chief Daala.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\nLeia was intimately involved in negotiations with Daala after Wan's rampage, and Javis Tyrr's discovery that the Jedi had secretly captured Seff Hellin; which he proceeded to make public. These negotiations resulted in the Jedi being able to retain custody of Wan and Hellin, though Daala's people would have to be allowed access to them at all hours. In addition, Leia, Jaina acting Grand Master Kenth Hamner, Cilghal, and [[Tekli]] were forced to publicly apologize for being involved, or failing to prevent, the Jedi's deception.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\nDuring this time, Kenth Hamner noted that Leia was expected to soon rise to the rank of Jedi Master. She may have become one at some point following this.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\n====Another fall====\n{{Quote|As interesting as it might be to explore my husband's nerf-headed theories on marriage, we'd better take care of our two patients. That GAS squad is right behind me.|Leia Solo|<ref name=\"Abyss\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Abyss]]''</ref>}}\nSometime after Leia and Han went to see Hellin. As they were talking, the Knight attacked Leia, but was subdued only after Cilghal subdued him with their stun stick. An hour or so afterward she helped subdue Jedi Knight Bazel Warv and Jedi Knight Yaqeel Saav'etu. Right after that, GAS found out about it and served a warrant automatically.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nLeia was the negotiator of course and decided that the GAS squad needed a little help understanding. Jaina and Jag were also there and had decided to step out. Leia then performed, as Jaina later referred to in Jag's limo, a Sligh Slipper and closed the door to the Temple, preventing GAS from getting in. When they went back inside the Temple, they found Barv having convulsions. Jedi Apprentice [[Melari Ruxon]], whom Han had told to fire another dart at the patients if they so much as twitched, had fired two darts at him.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nLeia had to calm the apprentice and her partner about the disease that was claiming their Knights, saying that everything was going to be alright and that Master Cilghal would figure this out. Master Hamner then came in demanding what had happened outside. Han was sent to find something to help transport Barv after he had interrupted their \"discussion.\" Hamner then demanded why she ignored a warrant saying that he would have preferred the two Knights in carbonite \"if that was what the law demanded.\" Leia reminded him that the law was not justice and that they could not turn over the Knights because they were and especially when Daala's solution is to turn them into carbonite.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nShe was saved by the bell when Master Cilghal came in, saying she had good news. However, as usual, her first priority was her patients and she had asked them to help move them. Master Hamner said he had strong objections, telling her that there was a warrant out for them. She asked the Solos how many they had hurt, learning that they had not hurt anyone. Cilghal then asked why they had a warrant out for them and Leia told her that the government considered them a \"public endangerment\" and saying that it was an overstatement telling her that they had had the Knights inside the Temple in two minutes flat. Master Hamner argued that since they had served a warrant, the Jedi are required to submit to it. Cilghal immediately took the Solos' side saying Daala was not going to freeze her patients to score points with public relations, and that if Master Hamner was that desperate, he was going to have to call the Council into it and take a vote.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nLeia had begun levitating Barv (with difficulty) when Apprentices, Swen and Reeqo's robes were found. At first Hamner had panicked, but Cilghal said that they had not caught the disease because they were too young. She then revealed that only the children who were in the Maw during the Yuuzhan Vong war were at risk, and that the adults were probably in the clear since none of them had fallen ill.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Recruiting_Drive_TotC.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Princess Leia recruiting for the Rebellion]]\n{{Quote|Charming to the last.|Wilhuff Tarkin|<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />}}\nIn her youth Leia had a fiery attitude and was headstrong, though not as much as her brother and father. As a child, Leia was not fond of her role as the Princess of Alderaan. She was often seen by many, especially her family, as a tomboy and was sometimes mistaken for a domestic girl rather than a princess. As she matured her outspoken nature blossomed and her dislike of her title ceased. Leia also had a strong personality and a bright intellect. Unlike her brother, Luke Skywalker, and her father, Anakin, Leia never looked for adventure or rushed into things without thinking. Like her mother, Leia avoided the corruption of politics, and instead concentrated on helping others.\n\n[[File:Leia_Organa_Solo_signature.png|thumb|right|200px|Leia Organa Solo's signature]]\nDespite growing up on the peaceful world of Alderaan, Leia never became soft. Throughout the Galactic Civil War, Leia proved to be the leader that everyone was willing to follow. Her fierceness and determination to restore freedom to the galaxy helped the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] get through even the toughest of battles. Leia had always put duty before her own personal needs, making her the perfect leader for the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. However, this would be a burden as she had to be away from her young children. Over time her strong stance on political matters ceased and by the time of the [[Black Fleet Crisis]] many were seeking to oust Solo from her position as Chief of State.\n\nLeia was known for having compassion for her friends, and would go to great lengths to help them, whenever she could. This was why she had a strong bond with her son, Jacen, who shared her view. Unfortunately, this bond was shattered after Jacen fell to the dark side.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Getting people to volunteer is one of your mother's many gifts, that's why she's a politician.|Han Solo|<ref name=\"Shards of Alderaan\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Shards of Alderaan]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:ArmedWithAttitudeLeia-OfficialPix.png|thumb|200px|Leia was an expert shot with a blaster.]]\nThough Leia would originally follow in her mother's footsteps, becoming a shrewd politician, she possessed many other talents. Indeed, Leia would eventually follow the path of her father and brother, becoming a Jedi of considerable skill; both with the Force and a lightsaber.\n\n===Jedi training===\nBy the time of Operation Shadow Hand, Leia was \"above all things\" a Jedi warrior.<ref name=\"Dark Empire 1\">[[Dark Empire 1|''Dark Empire'' 1]]</ref>\n\nA short time after having learned of her Force-sensitivity in 4 ABY, Leia was able to use the Force to sense her brother's presence, confirming he had survived the destruction of the second Death Star.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> During the Swarm War, Leia was able to use her much increased connection to the Force, having become the student of Master Sebatyne, to sense the whereabouts of Alema Rar by distinguishing between the powerful [[The Force/Legends#The Living Force|Living Force]] presences on the planet [[Tenupe]], which contrasted sharply with Alema's hidden presence.<ref name=\"The Unseen Queen\" />\n\nIn 10 ABY, Leia helped her brother defeat Palpatine through the use of her natural talent with [[Battle meditation/Legends|battle meditation]]; at this time Leia had little Force training and her ability to use such a powerful Force power is indicative of her strength in the Force.<ref name=\"Dark Empire\" />\n\nStill untrained, Leia was able to shield her infant son Anakin, from Palpatine's disembodied spirit, preventing the Sith Lord from possessing the child.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nLeia was skilled in the use of [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetic powers]] such as Force Push, Force Pull and Saber throw, as well as in using the Force to plant herself firmly in place. Leia exhibited a talent for telekinetically controlling the air paths taken by fog, being able to manipulate it at great speeds, allowing the ''Millennium Falcon'' to race through it without losing visibility prior to the onset of the Dark Nest crisis.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /> In [[40 ABY]], Leia was able to telekinetically hold the ''Millennium Falcon'' together against the pressure caused as it crashed through the atmosphere of Coruscant. However, it took the combined might of Leia, Jaina and Jacen to ultimately land the severely damaged ship with the Force.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\nAlthough strong in telekinesis, Leia was not very good with levitation. In 43.5 ABY, she strained in moving Jedi Knight Warv and could not divide her attention to Han when he said that two apprentices had left their robes behind.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nBefore she had any proper training, Leia's earliest displays with a lightsaber showed promise. She had been able to wound her own father, Darth Vader, before being quickly defeated on Mimban.<ref name=\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\" /> After training under Master Sebatyne, Leia's skills became formidable, allowing her to hold her own against, and severely injure, the much younger Alema Rar on several occasions. Even before her official training, Leia proved capable of defeating the centuries-old and fully trained Dark Jedi Beldorion in a fierce lightsaber duel.<ref name=\"Planet of Twilight\" /> Despite her grief over the supposed death of her brother, Leia proved capable of dueling Tahiri Veila; indeed, it was the intervention of Han Solo alone that made Leia spare the aspiring Sith apprentice's life.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\n[[File:LeiaBM.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Leia was adept at battle meditation.]]\nLike the other Jedi of her family, Leia demonstrated a talent for participating in Force Melds. Notably Leia participated in a battle meld with her daughter, Master and Zekk during the Battle of Tenupe.<ref name=\"The Swarm War\" />\n\nLeia was capable of telepathic feats; being able to communicate through the Force with her brother at a seemingly limitless range. Leia also demonstrated an ability to reach out to others in the Force to read their feelings or emotions. In her interrogation during the Swarm War, Leia was able to telepathically read the mind of her interrogator so as to learn his name and unnerve him.<ref name=\"The Swarm War\" />\n\nDuring her third duel with Alema Rar, Leia was temporarily able to fool Alema into relinquishing her weapon; an exceptional achievement against a fully trained Jedi Knight.<ref name=\"The Unseen Queen\" /> Leia proved able to use Jedi mind tricks on troopers who attempted to arrest her during the funeral of her sister-in-law.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\nLeia also showed a talent in [[Force-flash]]ing electronical devices. In 44 ABY, Leia and Han went to visit Tahiri Veila in her cell, as her trial had just begun. The guards there however would not let Leia and Han speak to Tahiri alone, the most they got was speaking to Tahiri alone in her cell, as the camera was recording their conversations. Leia Force-flashed it so all three of them could talk in privacy without being overheard by anyone.\n\nIn 45 ABY, while within the Hidden Monolith, Leia became [[Oneness/Legends|one]] with the dark side of the Force (though she was not tainted by this experience) and then the light side of the Force. In this latter state, she made a shell of [[Color/Legends|golden]] [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] and finally disintegrated the Qreph brothers with [[Golden flash]].<ref name=\"Crucible novel\">[[Crucible (novel)|''Crucible'']]</ref>\n\n===Other abilities===\n[[File:LeiaPilot-SWG5.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Leia often piloted a Y-wing.]]During her first term as senator, she was taught self-defense and combat skills by [[Giles Durane]], a weapons master and friend of Bail Organa.<ref name=\"The Weapons Master!\" /> Leia was an excellent marksman, missing rarely, if ever, with a blaster.<ref name=\"The Visual Dictionary\">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> She also proven to be a good [[Sniper/Legends|sniper]], managing to use an [[E-11 blaster rifle/Legends|E-11 blaster rifle]] to shoot Vader in the back from a great distance in a cave.<ref name=\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\" />\n\nLeia was also an able [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] pilot.

Her first lightsaber was created by herself while she was taught under her twin brother, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. During the [[Thrawn campaign]] in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], it was used by [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]] to kill both [[Luuke Skywalker]] and [[Joruus C'baoth]].

In [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]], Luke gifted her a second lightsaber that had a ruby-red blade that he built from scratch. The lightsaber is described as smaller than her previous one.<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\" /> Leia briefly used a [[Vima-Da-Boda's lightsaber|10,000 year old lightsaber]] that she got from an old Jedi named [[Vima-Da-Boda]]. On Byss, Leia used it to slice the hand off of an Imperial Sentinel, before Palpatine caused it to explode.<ref name=\"Dark Empire2\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]''</ref> While training under [[Saba Sebatyne]], Leia's lightsabers were taken by her new [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]], who told her that they did not reflect her skills anymore, and that it was time that she build a new lightsaber, one fit for a fully-fledged Jedi Knight.

Xizor was a member of the Falleen species, who were known for their special ability to attract members of the opposite sex by using their pheromones, which he used to his advantage by seducing Organa. The relationship was short-lived though, as Leia was able to overcome his seduction and delivered an embarrassing kick to Xizor's groin.<ref name=\"Shadows of the Empire\" />\n\n===Trioculus===\nDuring his campaign against the New Republic, [[Trioculus]] became infatuated with Leia Organa. Though the feeling was not mutual, Trioculus believed he could convince her to betray the New Republic and turn to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. His attempts to do so included telling her to accept her own darker aspects, and explaining that evil acts and murder were sometimes necessary, and did not diminish his own capacity to love.\n\nTrioculus's obsession with Leia would ultimately lead to his downfall: first when he tried to kill Zorba the Hutt for wanting her dead, which led to his capture and the rise of Kadann, and finally when he married Project Decoy's human replica droid, believing it to be Leia, which killed him.\n\n===Prince Isolder===\nIn [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]] Prince [[Isolder]] of Hapes asked for Leia's hand in matrimony. At a formal reception he presented many gifts which Leia accepted, nearly saying yes to his proposal. However, Han intervened and during a trip to Dathomir Isolder fell in love with the [[Witches of Dathomir|Dathomiri witch]] [[Teneniel Djo]].<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" />\n\n===Han Solo===\n[[File:Han_and_Leia_Razor_Edge_art_by_Trevas.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Leia and Han]]\n{{Quote|I love you!''\"<br />\"''I know.|Leia Organa and Han Solo|audio=ILoveYouIKnow-ESB.ogg|<ref name=\"Episode V\" />}}\nWhen they first met, the two got off to a rocky start;<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> however, as they worked together during the Galactic Civil War, Leia and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] developed a relationship that would last throughout the war.

However, when Han became frozen in carbonite, Leia realized that she loved him.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nIn [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], the two were married<ref name=\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" /> and had three children, Jaina, Jacen,<ref name=\"The Last Command\" /> and Anakin Solo,<ref name=\"Dark Empire II\" /> in the next two years. Even with the death of their youngest child Anakin<ref name=\"Star by Star\" /> and the fall of Jacen to the dark side,<ref name=\"Inferno\" /> their relationship grew stronger. Not even the war would tear them apart.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Leiaconcept.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Princess Leia concept art]]\nLeia Organa Solo appeared in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]; the [[Star Wars: A New Hope (novelization)|novel]] depicted her slightly before the film's release in [[1977]]. She would go on to be born in the [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|conclusion]] of the [[prequel trilogy]], in [[2005]]. However, that her brother, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]], and she would be born in the prequels was announced in [[1998]]. The [[original trilogy]] was [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|rereleased in theaters and VHS]] to commemorate the twenty year anniversary of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] [[1997|the year before]] and [[Star Wars Trivial Pursuit]] was released to coincide with this. The limited edition game, released in 1998, contained a sequestered pack of questions that served as a preview of [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|the first new trilogy installment]], one of which divulged this.\n\n===Portrayal===\nLeia was played most notably by actress [[Carrie Fisher]] in the [[original trilogy]] and ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.

In that draft, she had two brothers, Biggs and Windy, whose identities were substantially revised into their current form by the fourth draft (though they did not appear in intervening versions). The [[The Star Wars: From The Adventures of Luke Starkiller|third draft]] established her as '''Leia Organa''', Princess of the peaceful world of '''[[Ogana Major|Organa Major]]'''.

It may have been derived from \"Lay'a\" which in [[Wikipedia:Arabic|Arabic]] means \"weary\". Alternatively it might mean \"mistress'\" or \"ruler\" in [[Wikipedia:Assyrian|Assyrian]]. Additionally, a [[Wikipedia:Talmud|Talmudic]] source cites \"Leila\" as the \"Angel of Night\". A third origin could be the [[Wikipedia:Greek language|Greek]] word \"basileia,\" meaning \"reign\". There was also a biblical character called \"Leah\" (which is pronounced as Leia) in the book of Genesis, she was Jacob's first wife.\n*In the [[Wikipedia:Italy|Italian]] version of the films, \"Leia Organa\" was renamed to \"Leila Organa\".\n*In June [[2005]], [[Wikipedia:Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway|Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise]] [[Wikipedia:Norway|of Norway]] admitted in an interview that the first name of her youngest daughter, [[Wikipedia:Leah Isadora Behn|Leah Isadora Behn]], was inspired by Princess Leia.<ref name=\"Aftenposten\">{{WebCite|url=http://old.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1061009.ece|text=Princess speaks out on home births|author=Fuglehaug, Wenche|date=2005-06-16|work=[[Wikipedia:Aftenposten|Aftenposten]]|archivedate=20161227210528}}</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nThe costume designer for the films had a \"no lingerie in space\" policy, which prevented Fisher from wearing a [[Clothing/Legends|brassiere]].

Also, in one scene from Mel Brooks' [[Wikipedia:Spaceballs|''Spaceballs'']], Princess [[Wikipedia:Vespa|Vespa]] also appears to have the hairstyle, but reveals that she is actually merely wearing a large pair of headphones. In addition, in the parody film ''[[Thumb Wars]]'', the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who, as the name implies, had two cinnamon rolls for hair. Finally, preceding all the other parodies, the short film ''[[Hardware Wars]]'' shows Chewchilla, the Wookiee Monster actually eating one of Princess Ann-Droid's cinnamon buns.\n\nIn reality, however, Leia's hairdo may not be as unique as it first appears. Young marriageable [[Wikipedia:Hopi|Hopi Indian]] women traditionally wore a very elaborate \"squash blossom\" hairdo that superficially resembles Princess Leia's.<ref>[http://www.native-languages.org/hair.htm The \"squash blossom\" hairstyle]</ref><ref>[http://www.waukeganhistorical.org/collection-cory.html Waukegan Historical Society.org - \"The Hopi\"]</ref> George Lucas commented on the hairstyle in [[Wikipedia:Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine: \"In the 1977 film, I was working very hard to create something different that wasn't fashion, so I went with a kind of Southwestern [[Wikipedia:Pancho Villa|Pancho Villa]] woman revolutionary look, which is what that is.

Along with \"wildmans\" and \"assassinations,\" the \"Princess Leia\" is another popular method for freshmen (Plebes) to taunt their superiors. The freshman smears peanut butter on a pair of hamburger bun halves or English muffin halves, sneaks up behind an upperclassman in the dining hall, and sticks them on the upperclassman's ears.

There has been some debate about whether Leia is discussing her biological mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, or her foster mother Breha Organa. However, the official Star Wars website explicitly states in its \"Q & A\" section that Leia is remembering Padm\u00e9.<ref>{{SWArchive|url=qa|text=''Star Wars'' Q & A}}</ref>\n\n===Princess Leia's Theme===\n[[File:Sw4-Leia2.png|thumb|right|150px|Princess Leia]]\n'''[[Princess Leia's Theme]]''' is the musical [[Wikipedia:Leitmotif|leitmotif]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga that represents Princess Leia Organa.\n\nIt is first heard in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']], when Princess Leia is captured by Darth Vader. Later, it is heard as [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] plays Leia's holographic message to Obi-Wan Kenobi. It is also heard very fully as Leia nostalgically remembers the innocent past. The theme plays when [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] is killed by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], even though Leia has no direct involvement in this event. This was written in the soundtrack notes for [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']]. Finally, it plays in the end credits of ''A New Hope''.\n\nIn [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''The Empire Strikes Back'']] the theme is again present and is also developed in the new theme ''[[Han Solo and the Princess]]'', which acted as the film's love theme. Princess Leia's Theme plays as Han Solo tells Leia that he must leave to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. The only other time it plays is at the end of the movie, when Leia and Lando Calrissian rescue Luke Skywalker from Cloud City on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]. During this film, Leia's theme is replaced by the love theme mainly as a representation of Han and Leia being a couple. However, once Han is taken by [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], Leia's theme returns to signify again, she is alone.\n\nIn [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'']], the theme is only heard as Leia shoots a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] on the moon [[Endor/Legends|Endor]].\n\nThe theme was revived for the \"prequel\" trilogy. Its first occurrence in a sequential viewing of the six-film Star Wars saga is in ''Revenge of the Sith'', when her adoptive parents, [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]] and his wife, hold the newborn Leia during the final montage of shots at the end of the film. It reappears soon after during the end credits of the movie. This was to uplift the depressing mood of the movie and remind people that there was hope.\n\n==Alternate endings==\n{{Noncanonstart}}\n===Senator Leia Organa, Sith apprentice===\n{{Quote|As you all know, I once led an ill-conceived, violent insurrection against the Empire.

Misinterpreting Luke's words as being a wish for Han to train as a Jedi, Leia and the others travel to the planet, where they encounter Yoda. The Jedi Master explains that Leia is the one who has to be trained as a Jedi, and also reveals her family connection to Luke and Darth Vader. Leia agrees to be trained by Yoda, while Han reluctantly leaves to deal with his deathmark. Over the course of many months, Leia makes fast progress with her training and grows strong in the force. During the last stages of Leia's training, in which she assembles her own lightsaber, Darth Vader appears and mortally wounds Yoda. Leia and Vader then duel with their lightsabers, during which Leia manages to sever Vader's arm, before the Sith Lord is finally blasted and killed by Han and Chewbacca. Before Yoda dies, he encourages Leia to pass what she has learned on to others. Leia then burns her father's body in a funeral pyre.

Leia reveals that Luke died during the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]], and that she took up his destiny of becoming a Jedi Knight. The two clash furiously in the generator room, however, the Apprentice was more skilled than Leia.

    "plain_text": "mprot\nLeia\n1\nPrincess Leia Organa\nLeia Organa Solo (born Leia Amidala Skywalker), a Force-sensitive Human female was at various stages of her life, a politician, revolutionary, and Jedi Knight of the New Jedi Order. The daughter of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, Leia was the younger twin sister of Luke Skywalker, and, shortly after her birth, she became the adopted daughter of Bail Organa and Queen Breha of Alderaan, making her a Princess of Alderaan. An accomplished Senator, Leia Organa was most famous for her strong leadership during the Galactic Civil War and other subsequent galactic conflicts, making her one of the galaxys greatest heroes. Later she married Han Solo, and became the mother of their three children: Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo. Around the start of the Swarm War, Leia unknowingly became a grandmother through Jacens daughter Allana.\nShe had a forceful personality and bright intellect, having accomplished much in her youth: she was a strong proponent for the Rebel Alliance, the youngest Senator ever of the Galactic Empire at eighteen standard years of age, and a member of the Royal Family of Alderaan. Years later, she was instrumental in the creation of the New Republic, and was elected to the position of Minister of State, before becoming Chief of State, serving twice in that office.\nDue to her powerful Force heritage, Leia, following her familys legacy, became a Jedi Knight in the New Jedi Order. She was partially trained by her brother Luke and later by Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne, who declared her a fully trained Knight at the end of the Swarm War. This training would serve her well as the galaxy teetered on the edge of collapse into civil war once more during the Second Galactic Civil War, although it complicated her allegiance. During this conflict, Leias son Jacen turned to the dark side of the Force, becoming the Sith Lord Darth Caedus. Leia and Han became determined to destroy Caedus, feeling that their son was already dead. However, it was their daughter Jaina who ended his life in a lightsaber duel that also concluded the war.\nIn the aftermath of Caedus death, the Solos became the guardians of their granddaughter Allana, at the behest of her mother, Tenel Ka of Hapes, and remained two of the galaxys most important figures, standing with the Jedi Order amidst the tensions that arose between it and the government of Chief of State Natasi Daala.\n\n\u2022 Biography\n\n\u2022 Early life (19&ndash;1 BBY)\n\n\u2022 Birth on Polis Massa\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi and Padm\u00e9 Amidala\nA Human female, Leia was born on the asteroid colony of Polis Massa in 19 BBY, shortly after the start of the Great Jedi Purge and the formation of Palpatines Galactic Empire. Her heavily-pregnant mother, the Naboo Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, had suffered a Force choke by her husband and Leias father Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight who had fallen to the dark side of the Force. Amidala had been brought in a panic to a hospital of the Polis Massa Base by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had arranged rendezvous with Yoda, Grand Master of the Jedi Order, and Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary Due to Amidalas condition, the Polis Massan surgeons were nearly forced to remove the twins she was carrying, but the children were born just in time. In her last feeble breaths, Amidala named her twins \"Luke\" and \"Leia.\" The Senator died shortly after their birth, effectively orphaning Leia and her older twin brother. With the twins father believed dead on Mustafar, Bail Organa wondered what the Jedi intended to do with Luke and Leia.\nObi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda knew that the children, both strong in the Force, had to be protected from the inherently evilStar Wars Encyclopedia Emperor Palpatine, who intended to hunt down the remaining Jedi. Amidalas body was sent back to Naboo, with the instruction of preparing it to look like she was still pregnant. In this way, nobody would know of the childrens existence. When they decided it would be best if the twins were separated, Master Kenobi suggested that he would take the boy, and Master Yoda would take Leia. However, Yoda disagreed, arguing that they should wait for the right time before training the twins in the ways of the Force. At that point, Bail Organa offered to adopt baby Leia, as he and his wife were childless and longing for a daughter.Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith novelization The Jedi agreed, and the infant boy Luke was sent to live on Tatooine with his fathers stepbrother Owen Lars and his wife Beru. As promised, Leia was adopted and raised by Bail Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, who had been friends of Amidala during the antecedent conflict known as the Clone Wars.Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth' Through adoption, Leia Amidala Skywalker became known as Leia Organa, Princess of Alderaan. Nineteen years would pass before the twins saw each other again.\n\n\u2022 Adoption into the House of Organa\n\nLeia Organa\nLeia, the orphaned daughter of the Naboo Senator and the fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, was given a loving home within the House of Organa, one of the galaxys so-called Ancient Houses.Children of the Jedi Her adoptive parents could not have children of their own,Republic 61 so Leia became the crown princess, and, as such, was formally referred to as \"the Princess Leia Organa, of the Royal House of Alderaan.\"Star Wars radio drama Although the Organas were not trying to hide the fact that Leia was adopted, they never informed the Princess of her parentage, nor did they reveal the existence of her twin brother.VI However, during the short time between her birth and her mothers death, Leia gained a faint memory of her mother as a beautiful and kind, yet sad woman.\nLeia had a large extended family to take part in her upbringing. It included Silya Shessaun, a mentor and friend of Amidala,Shessaun, Silya Queen Brehas sister Deara,The Last of the Jedi: Master of Deception and Bail Organas three sisters Tia, Rouge, and Celly, whom Leia later described as \"three redoubtable dowagers\" that \"made her girlhood an intermittent burden.\"\nEven though Leia was rather advanced for her age, having learned to speak and walk before the age of one, she did not show any signs of Force potential&mdash;much to the relief of her adoptive father, who knew that being a Force-sensitive in Palpatines Empire would be a heavy burden. However, she had inherited her biological fathers gift, which surfaced for the first time in 18 BBY when her caregiver Memily was about to lean on a weakened railing overlooking a cliff. By throwing a laserball at it, Leia alerted Memily and saved her life.\nBecause of the incident, Leia became a target of the Galactic Empire for the first, but certainly not the last time. Word of a child with extraordinary reflexes had reached the galactic capital of Coruscant, and Inquisitors Ferus Olin and Hydra were sent to investigate. Olin, a former Jedi apprentice, was in fact a double agent trying to save as many Force-sensitives as possible, and had come to Alderaan on Obi-Wan Kenobis behest. Even though the Inquisitorius was not aware of the childs gender, Kenobi feared that the toddler might be Leia and wanted to turn the Empires eye away from Alderaan. Olin covered up the incident, stating it was nothing more than a rumor, and Leias heritage remained a secret. The Imperial informer turned out to be Deara Antilles; Queen Breha had mercy on her sister, but exiled her from the royal family forever. Following the incident, Olin settled on Alderaan. The former Jedi was tasked with protecting the Princess, following her like a shadow under the guise of the obsequious botanist Fess Ilee.The Last of the Jedi: Reckoning Olins act was so convincing that the young Princess came to despise that greasy yes-man Ilee who always seemed to get in her way.Rebel Force: Hostage'\n\n\u2022 The tomboy Princess\n\nThe Princess Leia Diaries\n]]\nNicknamed Lelila,The Crystal Star the Princess grew up with Winter, the orphaned daughter of Bail Organas aide Sheltay Retrac. Leias best friend and companion since earliest childhood, Winter possessed a natural grace and poise that often led court visitors to mistake her for the Princess of Alderaan, while the tomboy Leia was regarded as a domestic girl. The Princesss lack of upper-class gentility remained a constant source of despair to her aunts Tia, Rouge, and Celly, who were nevertheless determined to turn her into what they called \"a Proper Princess,\" and hired deportment teachers to drill into her manners fitting for the heir of an Ancient House. One part of making her a lady was to learn how a princess dresses up and does her hair. According to Alderaanian customs, Leias hair was allowed to grow long and arranged into elaborate hairstyles. Ironically, one of Leias trademark symbols&mdash;her signature \"bun\" coiffure&mdash;was inherited from her mothers homeworld of Naboo, although a long time passed before she came to know it. To avoid the tiresome hairstyling, she even cut her hair once&mdash;only to be forced to wear a wig, even though she argued that she did not need earmuffs in the summer.\nWhile Leia disliked being \"everyones dress-up doll,\" her bright and outspoken nature blossomed out when she had a chance to learn diplomacy, government and languages.The New Essential Chronology Like her birth mother Padm\u00e9 Amidala before her, Leia had the benefit of palace education: the best equipment and the finest tutors,The New Essential Guide to Characters among them Arn Horada, who instructed her in galactic politics and history,Star Wars (1977) 30 and Amidalas former handmaiden Sab\u00e9, who tutored her in matters of court etiquette and diplomacy.The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide Wanting to expose her to as many experiences as possible, Bail Organa often took his daughter along to trips to other worlds, such as Ithor, where he attended the Time of the Meeting as the representative of the Imperial Senate. About six years old at the time, the Meeting was an unforgettable experience for Leia.\nDespite knowing that she was loved, Leia sometimes felt an outsider to her family. Winter was like a sister to her, but the young Princess still wished she had a brother or a sister of her own, someone she could truly feel close to. In her growing years, she often felt that she was just slightly different, without exactly knowing how, and that a part of her was missing. Winter remained a comfort to Leia, despite the differences in their personality. Though the pairs physical resemblance was tempered by Winters stunning white hair, the friends soon learned to employ similar looks for tactical advantage, a practice they would continue throughout their lives. Winter sometimes disguised herself as Leia so that the Princess could escape the Aldera Royal Palace to create mischief and visit inappropriate boys. Leia also befriended Neena, a musically talented girl about her age who lived in the Organa household.Galaxy Guide 6: Tramp Freighters\nBesides receiving palace education, Leia attended the Collegium for Young Ladies in Crevasse City as of 12 BBY. During her time there, the young Leia expressed early tendencies toward rebellion. When the schools staff once served bottled juice instead of freshly squeezed, a seven-year-old Leia staged a sit-in protest with the other students. After playing the forbidden anthem of the Old Republic, and reprogramming the Collegiums security mainframe to swap every reference to Palpatine with a curse, the Princess was finally expelled from the school.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II Xbox 360]] databank\nIn the year 11 BBY, Leia and her friend Winter once hid a giant wooly moth in the desk drawer of Alderaans Minister of Agriculture. The harmless joke, however, took a more serious turn when it was discovered that the moth had eaten the budget for the whole next year, written on a sheet of flimsiplast. As a means of punishment, Leia was banned from participating in a party held in the Grand Ballroom of the Royal Palace. The Princess and Winter attended the gala anyway, hidden behind a marble staircase with a store of scavenged food. Having accidentally crossed the eyes of Fess Ilee, the young girls were afraid and got out of their hiding place, bumping into Bail Organa, who promptly banned them to their rooms. The following night, the Princess got over the wall so she could join Winter at the Gingerbell blossom festival. Walking alone in the deserted streets of Aldera, Leia was almost kidnapped by a trio of goons who worked for Senator Ask Aak of Malastare. Aak wished to use the child as a bargaining chip so that Bail Organa would vote they way he wanted. The rapture attempt, however, was thwarted by Ferus Olin, who had been following the Princess in the streets. Later that night, Leia lost her way. The Princess climbed upon a half-finished building so she would be able to see the Palace in the distance, but she nearly fell while trying to climb down. Once again, Ferus Olins timely intervention allowed Leia to escape unharmed.\nTwo years later, Princess Leia was attending the prestigious Alderaan Select Academy for Young Ladies under the tutelage of the strict Madame Vesta, whom the Princess described as \"a rancor of a nanny.\" Together with other daughters of Alderaanian nobles, the Princess learned etiquette, table manners and many other useful (and to her mind, rather boring) things that a lady needed to know. During this time, Leia saw the downside of the upper class as well: many of the girls had a condescending attitude towards ordinary people, and expensive parties were thrown in the court even though many in the galaxy were hungry and suffering. Once she reached her adolescent years, Leia discovered that one of her school friends used drugs.Planet of Twilight\nHowever, her adolescent years also had their share of cherished memories. Leia became friends with Heeth and Raal Panteer, two scions of the patrician House Panteer. Once, the Princess snuck out at night with Raal Panteer to swim in the reflecting pools of Aldera. The pair, who had fallen in love, exchanged their first kiss on that occasion, but the relationship failed to last. Organa and the Panteer brothers would meet again during the Galactic Civil War.Star Wars: Empire: A Little Piece of Home At age thirteen, Leia and Winter met Jahan Cross, the son of the Alderaanian diplomat Davim Cross. Both young girls had a \"mad crush\" on him, which, according to the Princess, \"lasted three whole days.\"\nAfter a long hiatus, the three met again in 3 BBY, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention. Upon seeing the two young ladies three years after leaving Alderaan, Cross made it look like he did not recognize Leia, \"mistaking\" Winter for the Princess on purpose.Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1\n\n\u2022 A senator in the making\n\nBail Organa and Wilhuff Tarkin, discussing 13-year-old Leia\nLeia showed promise in politics and from early on, Bail Organa began grooming her to one day succeed him in the Imperial Senate, encouraging her to attend Alderaanian debates and palace receptions for offworld personnel. In this Leia unknowingly followed the footsteps of not only her adoptive father, but her late birth mother, who had entered politics at an early age and became a Senator. Indeed, Leia resembled Padm\u00e9 Amidala in many ways: she was confident, poised, and a had a quick political wit.\nWhen Leia was thirteen, she met Wilhuff Tarkin for the first time when he came to visit Bail Organa on Alderaan. She had heard a lot about the Moff from her father, none of it good. She instantly disliked him, maintaining that he represented everything that was wrong with the Empire. Leia was particularly disgusted with the idea of Tarkin having a slave, as she did not understand how it was possible that the Emperor allowed slavery. She even dropped a water balloon on his head while \"watering her plants.\" The visit made Leia seriously contemplate what kind of galaxy she lived in, and what she could do to change it.\nAt the age of sixteen, Leia attended the University of Alderaan together with Winter, whose holographic and audiographic memory, as Leia would joke, was very useful with homework. They studied history and art, two subjects the Empire seemed eager to suppress, which in Bail Organas opinion was all the more reason to study them. Leia also began training with Giles Durane, a mercenary her father had hired to teach her self-defense and marksmanship. True to her tomboyish nature, she enjoyed these lessons far more than those of Madame Vesta, and showed considerable talent in both areas.\nAround this time, the Princess began to realize that her father was preparing her for something more than just becoming the next Senator of her home planet. A month before turning seventeen&mdash;the age of adulthood in the eyes of Alderaanian lawIt was established in Rebel Dawn that the \"age of responsibility\" on both Alderaan and Corellia was set at seventeen.&mdash;she accidentally overheard a secret HoloNet meeting Bail Organa was having with fellow Senators Mon Mothma of Chandrila and Garm Bel Iblis of Corellia, where the name Alliance to Restore the Republic came up. Leia's hatred for the Empire had been growing over the years&mdash;she certainly found their treatment of non-Humans and women atrocious and their desire to control everything appalling&mdash;but this was the first time she heard anyone discuss an open rebellion. She decided not the tell her father what she had heard, but promised herself to make him proud and do whatever it took to restore the freedoms the Empire was systematically taking away.\nAmong the Ancient Houses, it was customary to bring the daughters to Coruscant when they finished school at seventeen&mdash;or even sixteen, if the parents were ambitious to start the long and complex search of a suitable groom candidate at the Imperial Court. The Princesss aunts would have been glad to see their niece marry someone from one of the other old Houses; Leia, however, regarded their heirs as \"brainless twerps\" and refused to be presented to the Emperor until she could do so as a Senator in her own right, not simply as a young girl in the Court marriage market. Her aunts were horrified, doubly so when Leias decision was backed by Bail Organa.\nThe time for Leias introduction at the Imperial Palace came soon enough, though. At the age of 18, she became the youngest Imperial Senator ever elected, and Bail Organa formally presented her to Palpatine shortly before she assumed her Senatorial post. Having witnessed earlier a Caamasi being arrested by two stormtroopers for simply trying to buy a meal at a restaurant, Leia firmly decided that she would bring up the issue to Palpatine at the same time. When she met the Emperor, however, she became frightened by the dark side radiating from him and was unable to do anything more than mutter thanks to his compliments as Darth Vader watched. Following the reception, Bail assured her that there was nothing to be ashamed of, as it was a common reaction to seeing Palpatine, especially for the first time. To make her feel better, Organa told Leia how proud he was of her, and related a piece of good news&mdash;he had arranged for the Caamasi she saw arrested to be released. Happy, Leia went to meet the Caamasi, who introduced himself as Egros Akala.First Impressions (comic story)\n\n\u2022 Imperial Senate and involvement in the Rebellion (2&ndash;0 BBY)\n\n\u2022 The Rebel Senator\n\nPalpatine to Leia on their first meeting\nSometime after turning 17, Leia had shared with her father her disgust of the Empire and how it treated its citizens, as well as her desire to make a difference with him. Her fire and abilities were noted by some Imperial officials because, as of 2 BBY, Leia was being held captive on the planet Kashyyyk to keep her out of the way. She was not harmed, but rather treated as a dignified \"guest\" as the Imperials in charge did not wish to provoke a galactic incident by harming the daughter of a powerful and wealthy Senator. Still, she was not allowed to leave, nor was she permitted to communicate with the outside world. Also, Captain Ozzik Sturn threatened to have her be an \"unfortunate victim in a Wookiee uprising.\" While on the planet, Leia collected data on the Skyhook that was being used to take Wookiee slaves from the planet in mass numbers. She stored this data in her droid, R2-D2. When Darth Vaders secret apprentice, Galen Marek, arrived to save her in order to enlist the trust and cooperation of her father, Leia refused to leave until the skyhook was destroyed. Marek promised to destroy it if she would go leave the planet and fly to safety, which she did.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'\nA few weeks later, Leia participated in the meeting on Corellia to establish the Rebel Alliance with her father, Mon Mothma, Garm Bel Iblis, Jedi Rahm Kota, and Galen Marek. However, while the other attendees of the meeting were present in person, Leia participated via hologram. Her physical absence turned out to be beneficial as that her holo transmission was able to be terminated before her involvement could be discovered when the meeting was raided by stormtroopers led by Darth Vader. Thus her direct involvement with the new Rebellion was unknown to Vader and the Emperor.\nLeia was also present on Kashyyyk for the meeting that did officially establish the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Because Marek had sacrificed his own life to save her father, Kota, Mothma, and Bel Iblis from the Emperor so that they might live to establish the Rebellion, she suggested the adoption of his family crest as the symbol of the fight against the Empire.\nIn 1 BBY, Bail Organa&mdash;now a known enemy of the Empire&mdash;stepped down as Senator of Alderaan, a position he had held for thirty-one years, and Leia took his place. A keen political thinker, Leia knew that her diplomatic immunity and consular ship would be perfect for running covert missions for the Alliance. Bail agreed, and thus began Leia's double life as a Senator and a Rebel.\nYoung Senator Organa inherited her fathers diplomatic cruiser, the Corellian corvette Tantive IV. Raymus Antilles, a relative of Queen Breha who had served under Bail Organa as well, continued as the captain of the ship.Antilles, Raymus Winter accompanied Leia to Coruscant as an aide; she was aware of the Princesss involvement in the Rebellion, and participated in many of the Alliances operations herself in the following years.A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded Under Winter'\nDuring her time in the Senate, Leia worked with Senator Pooja Naberrie of Naboo, her maternal cousin. The two became good friends, completely unaware of their familial relationship. Not everyone was pleased with the young Senator, however. Despite her first intimidating encounter with Palpatine, Leia became one of the leading voices of criticism towards the Emperors policies. Being somewhat of a political firebrand, her outraged sense of justice made some people feel threatened, while others viewed her as pathetically idealistic. Drost Elegin, head of the Ancient House Elegin and a notorious playboy at Palpatines court, mockingly called her \"Madame Senator\" and \"Little Miss Inalienable Rights.\"\nDuring the early stages of the Galactic Civil War, Leia aided Star Tours as a rebel front for ferrying Rebel spies. When one of the Rebel spies nearly ended up captured at Spaceport THX1138, Leia gave a transmission to the escaped StarSpeeder 1000 carrying the spy to go to the rendezvous point where the spy will be safely extracted by the Rebels.Star Tours: The Adventures Continue In addition, she eventually ended up getting a price on her head and was among the most wanted criminals in the galaxy.Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (Tokyo Disneyland)\n\n\u2022 Mission to Ralltiir and the Battle of Kattada\n\nStar Wars: Empire: Princess... Warrior'\nPrior to the Battle of Yavin 4 Leia went on a diplomatic mission to Ralltiir, a world subjugated by the Empire. It was here that she discovered a wounded Rebel who possessed vital information on the Death Star. While in the process of rescuing him, Leia encountered the Moff of Ralltiir, Lord Tion. After getting the information, Leia rescued the Rebel. Later, Leia killed Tion in self-defense, making her an enemy of the Empire. After discovering the Imperial superweapon, Rebel spies were able to steal the Death Star's blueprints, sending them to the Rebel Alliance before being killed.\nFollowing the trip to Ralltiir where they retrieved the Ralltiir rebel, Basso, Princess Leia and her uncle Raymus Antilles traveled on the Tantive IV to Kattadas main space port in Haleoda. Upon arriving, they were greeted by Haleodas ruler Madam Mia Ikova, a sympathizer of the Rebel Alliance, who agreed to help deliver supplies to the rebels on Ralltiir. Later, at the spaceport, Leia and Mia Ikova received word from a messenger that an Imperial patrol ship was landing. By then, Leia and her crew had realized that it was too late to escape and that they could not leave Mia Ikova and her people to deal with the Empire alone. The Imperial Landing craft landed directly beside the Tantive IV, and both sides opened fire. Shortly after, a force of stormtroopers and scout troopers departed from the landed on the planet under the command of Commander Karg, who announced that all who were present were under arrest in the name of Emperor Palpatine. After refusing to surrender Karg ordered his legion of stormtroopers to shoot, injuring Mia.\nEnraged at her refusal to surrender, Karg attempted to shoot Leia. Luckily, Leia was saved when the Tantive IV turbolaser turret opened fire on Karg, wounding him severely. The Tantive IV crew then retrieved Leia, Ikova and Karg and brought them to the medical bay. Unfortunately, Mia wasnt able to overcome her injuries and died. Leia blamed herself for what had happened and wished she had never come to Kattada. Ikovas father responded by reminding Leia that she had come to seek help for the rebels on Ralltiir who needed their aid badly and that she should not let what had occurred sway her from her purpose, before presumably dying. Later, Organa lead a ground assault, successfully neutralizing the imperial threat on the planet. Following the battle, Leia left for Alderaan on the Tantive IV' after saying farewell to her Kattadan allies.\nAfter the disastrous Battle of Kattada, Organa was contacted by her father, giving her an important mission to track down Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and bring him to Alderaan. Leia set a course to the planet Tatooine with the stolen Death Star plans in tow.\n\n\u2022 Early Galactic Civil War (0 BBY&ndash;4 ABY)\n\n\u2022 Death Star I campaign\n\nLeia Organa\nIn 0 BBY, Organa was captured along with her ship, the Tantive IV, by Darth Vader. She was secretly on a rebel mission above Tatooine to find Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and return him to Alderaan, although she simply stated she was a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan. After a skirmish between the star destroyer and Tantive IV, the rebel ship's reactor was damaged, and Darth Vader boarded the ship through the main hangar of his star destroyer after pulling in the damaged ship with a tractor beam. The Sith Lord sought to recover the plans for the Death Star I.\nUnknown to Vader, the young senator had hidden the plans inside an R2 unit, R2-D2, and sent the droid to find the legendary Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet Tatooine. Leia attempted to hide from the stormtroopers in her ship, but was found and stunned after shooting one of them with her sporting blaster. She was cuffed and brought before Lord Vader, who accused her of treason, although Leia untruthfully denied any connection with the Alliance.\nVader brought her to the Death Star I, where he personally interrogated and tortured her, seeking the location of the plans and the hidden Rebel base from which the Empire suspected the Alliance was striking. Remarkably, she managed to keep silent, despite Vaders Sith powers and the use of an interrogation droid. In an interrogation cell, she was able to resist punishment and refrain from revealing the bases location.\nWilhuff Tarkin, Leias old acquaintance and now a Grand Moff, threatened Organa with the destruction of her homeworld, Alderaan, if she did not reveal the location of the Rebel base. She lied, giving them instead the location of a long-since abandoned base on Dantooine. Tarkin proceeded with the destruction of Alderaan regardless, saying Dantooine was too desolate and sparsely populated to make a suitable demonstration of the superweapons power; this was one of the most infamous acts of the Empire and a shocking example of the Tarkin Doctrine of rule by terror. Leia was then placed in a holding cell and scheduled to be executed, while the Imperial Navy deployed scout craft to investigate Dantooine.\nPrincess Organas message had reached Obi-Wan Kenobi by this time, and he set out from Tatooine with Luke Skywalker, intending to bring R2-D2 to Leia on Alderaan. Kenobi had hired Han Solo as a pilot. Arriving in the Alderaan system shortly after the worlds destruction, the Millennium Falcon was captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, while the station was still positioned in the system.\nSurprisingly, this small group managed to avoid immediate capture. Finding that Organa was on the station, they set out to rescue her. Killing a number of stormtroopers they succeeded in rescuing Leia. Tarkin had by this point discovered that Dantooine was indeed abandoned. In order to find the true location of the hidden base, he ordered his soldiers to allow the small band to escape with Leia, after planting a tracking device on the Falcon. Darth Vader, meanwhile, set out to find Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom he later killed in a duel.\nThe Princess ran with the band of rescuers, traveling along a large portion of the station to try to locate the Millennium Falcon. They found the ship, and, using Obi-Wan's duel with Vader as a distraction, escaped the station, thanks to Obi-Wan disabling the tractor beam. Organa realized that her escape must have been deliberately permitted by the Empire, and surmised that the ship was being tracked. However, she nonetheless decided to return to the base on Yavin 4.\nPresumably, she would have been arrested immediately had she tried to land on any inhabited Imperial world, and finding another place to trade ships would have been complicated and dangerous. (Locating the tracking device would have been virtually impossible, given how small such a device could be.) This was a risk, of course: if no weakness could be found, or if the discovered weakness could only be exploited by, for instance, a saboteur on board the Death Star, it would be necessary to stage a massive evacuation.\nReturning to Yavin 4, Princess Organa found that her gamble had paid off, as the plans did in fact reveal a weakness that starfighters could potentially exploit: a small exhaust vent in the polar trench. The rebel Alliance readied their fighters, and, receiving Instructions from Leia, readied for what would be known as the Battle of Yavin, a major turning point in galactic history, and the event the new date system for the galaxy was based on. During the battle, the Death Star was destroyed by Organa's twin brother, Luke Skywalker (although this familial relationship was unknown by both twins at this time) after two runs attempting to hit the vent. This marked a turning point for the Rebellion.\nFollowing the Rebel victory at the Battle of Yavin, Leia held a public ceremony, rewarding Luke Skywalker and Han Solo for their accomplishments and heroism during the battle. Following the ceremony, Leia joined in the following celebration and gave Han a kiss. She was then carried onto a table where she gave Chewbacca a medal of his own. The next day, C-3PO informed Leia that Skywalker and R2 had not returned from a joy ride he had taken. She and Han, along with C-3PO took a speeder and used heat sensors to find R2, with the sound of fighting leading them to finding Luke.\n\n\u2022 Hero of the Rebellion\n\nLeia Organa and Darth Vader\nSeveral days after the Battle of Yavin, Leia received reports that Han Solo was stealing Sith treasure from the ancient temples on the forest moon. She, along with Luke, raced out to catch him, but he rocketed away in the Millennium Falcon just as they got to the temple. Furious, she denounced Solo, despite his efforts at the major battle, and issued a warrant for his arrest, should he return to Yavin 4. When he did return, she found out that the treasure was sold to finance the Alliance, and she forgave him. Subsequently, she went with him on a mission to the Incom Factory to negotiate the purchase of new X-wings with Vors Voorhorian.\nA week after the Battle of Yavin, Leia, R2-D2, and Luke traveled to Rebel base of Akuria II to insure against a sudden Imperial counter-attack on Yavin. But because Artoo wasnt properly repaired the ship went off course. After a near-miss with an Imperial fleet, Organa and Skywalker encountered four android children, who had the power to control the elements, and a computerized \"Keeper\" on a formerly war-torn world who helped them to escape the Imperials.The Keeper's World\nWhen the Galactic Empire destroyed Alderaan the Rebellion lost a lot of its funds. Therefore, Jan Dodonna sent Leia to Muunilinst where she should meet the Muun Mak Luunim. That Muun had codes for some secret accounts of the Rebellion and although Leia wanted to travel to some survivors of Alderaans destruction by Delaya she agreed to the mission. Together with Luke, Chewbacca, Han and the droids she flew to Muunilinst but they were attacked by an imperial TIE fighter before they could meet Mak Luunim. In the fight an unknown pilot came to their aid and adjacent he crashed on a moon. Leia and the others found his empty fighter and by the searching of him they met a reek which Luke could beat. After that they discovered the pilot in a cave where they were attacked a second time by a reek and Han shot with his blaster for their defense so that they were surrounded in the cave. Only Luke could disburden them and with the Falcon the group and the pilot who said that his name had been Tobin Elad could leave the moon. Because he told Leia that he had been a warrior who had lost his home and family she got some sympathy for him. They took him with them to Muunilinst nevertheless Han and Leia werent sure whether they could trust him. On Muunilinst Luke must drive a race for the Muun Nal Kenuun so that he gave him the codes of the Rebellion which he took after the death of Mak Luunim. Without the others Leia and Luke made an emergency plan and before the race began the two seemed to have a controversy. Leia left the group and appropriate the krayt dragon Urgiluu of Nal Kenuum. So she had a pressurizing and could change the freedom of the group against the dragon when Kenuum wanted to get the head money of Han and Tobin. With the codes of the Rebellion they went back.Rebel Force: Target'\nAgainst Luke's better judgment, Leia sought the help of Raal Panteer, a childhood friend from Alderaan, in finding a new location for the Rebel base. Raal did not care for the Rebellion much, though he did care for Leia, and proposed that she stay on the moon with him and together they could preserve a bit of Alderaan together. When Leia accompanied Raal on a tour through the wild preserve, they crash-landed on planet where Panteer was bitten by a creature and died. Enraged Heeth ordered Leia to leave the planet, refusing to help the Rebellion.\nShortly after the loss of their base on Yavin 4, Leia, Nera Dantels, and Jorin Sol accompanied Luke to Jabiim where they discovered that the locals had a personal vendetta against Anakin Skywalker after he abandoned them to the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. They were captured by the natives shortly after. Having managed an escape from the rebel group who wanted revenge for their fathers actions during the Clone Wars, Leia, Luke, and the droids fought their way through Imperial stormtroopers and encountered Nolan Gillmunn, a local resistance leader and son of Orliss Gillmunn. Becoming allied with Nolan and his band of rebels, Organa and the others participated in the subjugation of Jabiim.Star Wars: Empire: In the Shadows of Their Fathers'\nIn 0 ABY Organa traveled to Metalorn on a mission to spread the message of hope to its residents. Metalorn, a factory planet, had been controlled by the Empire, under the direction of Governor Corwyth with no information of the Rebellion reaching its citizens. Leia managed to evade Imperial stormtroopers long enough to contact her former instructor Arn Horada in order for him to spread the word that the Rebel Alliance actively opposed the Empire's tyranny. Soon after Organa was confronted by Baron Orman Tagge before she was able to establish any details, but managed to escape with the help of a youngster named Tammi.\nA short time later, she was forced to land on Bedlam while escaping from Imperial forces. While running from Imperial stormtroopers, Leia tripped over a stormtrooper helmet, twisting her ankle. She soon discovered the remains of Imperial stormtroopers shed tripped over seemed to have been lying there for thousands of years. Spotting Imperial forces closing in on her, Leia decided to keep moving despite her injured ankle. She then met four Bedlam Spirits&mdash;Tilotny, Horliss-Horliss, Cold Danda Sine and Splendid Ap&mdash;and three stormtroopers. The Spirits, curious about the \"tiny movers,\" decided to play with them. Tilotny turned one stormtrooper into a diamond and then transformed Leias heart into a diamond as well, killing her instantly. Meanwhile, Tilotny killed the remaining stormtroopers and ordered Splendid Ap to clean the mess. He resurrected Leia and the stormtroopers, but placed the latter 8,000 years in the past. After regaining consciousness, Leia somehow managed to return to Yavin base.\nDuring the time period shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Leia was assigned to go Shelkonwa to meet with an Adarian named Yeeru Chivkyrie to see if she could integrate three separate Adarian groups into the Rebel Alliance. Originally, Luke and Han were going to go with her, but a series of pirate attacks on their supply lines caused the Alliance to send them to investigate, and Hans attention had been annoying her anyway. She would later regret that decision, though. Arriving on Shelkonwa, Leia met with the leaders of the resistance groups, and later with Administrator Vilim Disra, who she had been told wanted to seek to join the Alliance. However, Disra, upon seeing her, double-crossed them, locking down the spaceports and starting a search for her. Leia took cover in a small lower-income neighborhood, posing as a tapcafe waitress. While there, she foiled a burglary attempt on a nearby tenement, causing the local populace to not tell patrollers of her presence. Eventually, Vader and the 501st Legion arrived in search of her, but Han, Luke, and Chewie arrived on Shelkonwa, having heard that she was in trouble. Using an ISB freighter that had been appropriated by the Hand of Judgment, who were working with Han, Luke, and Chewie, they made their way back to the Falcon, where the Rebels and rogue stormtroopers parted ways.Allegiance'\nWith Organa now exposed as a Rebel, she took over the Alliances diplomatic efforts. At the Conference of Uncommitted Worlds on Kabal, she won the Alliance the support of Silver Fyre and her Aquaris Freeholders.\"Traitor's Gambit\" She also encouraged sedition among the planets of the distant Minos Cluster.\nJust before the Evacuation of Yavin, a transport filled with Alderaanian refugees, Bail Organa landed at the Rebel base. As Leia went out to greet them, she was reunited with Darlen, a friend from her life as a Princess on the destroyed planet.\nIn 2 ABY, Leia, accompanied by Luke, crash-landed on Mimban. On Mimban, Leia and Luke encountered Halla, a Force-sensitive. They struck a deal with her, promising to find the Kaiburr crystal if she aided in their escape. During their search, Leia and Luke confronted Darth Vader. Darth Vader managed to injure Skywalker and would have killed him if it werent for Leia. Using Lukes lightsaber, Leia briefly dueled the Dark Lord and while had been able to strike a glancing blow on him, she was quickly defeated due to her inexperience with the weapon. Luke was able to heal her wounds,Splinter of the Minds Eye bringing her back to life, with the Kaiburr crystal and defeated Vader, with the help of Obi-Wan Kenobis spirit. Leia subsequently secured funding from the Circarpous IV business underground after revealing an illegal Imperial mine on Mimban.\nShortly after the disastrous mission to Mimban, Leia was able to access lost Organa resources of money and capital on Ord Mantell greatly needed for the Rebel war effort. Leia also focused her efforts on rallying planets to help them defeat the Empire. On one occasion she traveled to the Minos Cluster, where she helped unify Rebellion against the Empire.\nAt some point during 1 ABY Leia crash landed on Phelarion. Under the alias Lerna she became a domestic servant for Lady Tarkin until she was able to escape on board the Millennium Falcon.\"Princess Leia, Imperial Servant\"\nAround 2 ABY, the Rebels began to move their base to the ice planet Hoth after their base on Yavin 4 was discovered. Leia helped establishing Echo Base since it was but a small outpost. In 3 ABY, Luke went missing while on a patrol. Worried, Organa sent Han to look for him. Fortunately Han returned with an unconscious and badly injured Skywalker in tow. Luke was immediately put into a bacta tank and recovered from his encounter with a wampa. When Han confronted Leia on the issue of their relationship, an incensed Organa kissed Luke, causing a love triangle between the three friends.V\nAdmiral Ozzel, the Imperial officer directing Lord Vaders fleet, used probe droids to find the Rebel base, although at the time, he thought they were smugglers. When Vader confirmed that it was indeed the rebel base, he ordered a full-scale attack. Discovering that the Alliance was at risk, Organa helped coordinate the evacuation of the Rebel base from Hoth. Transports were launched to take members to other bases, accompanied by fighters and ground-based ion cannons. Snowspeeder squadrons and infantry were deployed to hold off incoming Imperial AT-ATs. However, the attacking forces penetrated the rebel base, and damaged it substantially. Despite the ongoing battle, she remained composed and issued commands from the crumbling base. Luckily, she was able to escape any danger and flee with C-3PO, Han Solo and Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon', left with no other option but to accompany them due to a cave-in caused by the bombardment blocking the path to the transports. Pursued by Imperial fighters, and hobbled by a non-functional hyperdrive, they escaped by flying into an asteroid field.\n\n\u2022 Crisis at Cloud City\n\nLando Calrissian\nPrincess Organas initially adversarial relationship with Han Solo around this time evolved into a more romantic one. In the asteroid field, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia landed in a tunnel on a small asteroid, attempting to repair the damaged hyperdrive of the Millennium Falcon'. The trio did not realize that the tunnel was in reality the throat of a fabled space slug, but escaped just in time. They then tried to find a system near enough to reach; they make their way to Bespin.\nNot long after their escape from Hoth, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and Threepio went to Cloud City, then owned by Hans friend, Lando Calrissian, to get help with the Falcon. Soon after they landed, on platform 327, Cloud City officials came to greet them, but the group does not know that they only allowed them onto the system because the Imperial bounty hunter, Boba Fett was present searching for the escaped rebels, and had followed them. C-3PO went missing, and Lando took them in for breakfast, only for the trio to find that Darth Vader and his stormtroopers were lying in wait. Han was soon tortured and Leia and the Wookiee were thrown in the dungeon. Moments later Lando came to the dungeons to tell the group that he did what he needed to and informed them of Vaders trap for Luke Skywalker.\nSolo was then used as a test subject for the carbonite-freezing process, which Darth Vader intended for Luke Skywalker (Solo survived the freezing process, and was taken to Jabba the Hutt by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.) Before he was frozen, her parting words were \"I love you,\" to which Solo responded \"I know.\" (Listen) After Han was frozen Leia unsuccessfully warned Luke of the incoming danger before being taken as Vaders prisoner. Lando then felt pity for the prisoners and escaped in the Millennium Falcon' along with Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and the rediscovered C-3PO and R2.\nLeia displayed latent telepathy, despite having never been trained in the use of the Force, when Luke reached out to her and she sensed his distress as he hung from a weather vane after being defeated by Darth Vader. She led the Falcon back to rescue him, and together they departed for a secret rendezvous point where the Rebel fleet was hiding.\n\n\u2022 Rescue of Han Solo\n\nRescue of Han Solo/Legends\nLeia Organa and Han Solo\nAs the war continued, Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Rebellion finance minister Viscount Tardi traveled to the banking world of Aargau to complete the financing of a sale of X-wing fighters to the Rebellion. However, they were unaware that Darth Vader and his entourage of paid assassins were also on the planet.Star Wars (1977) 48\nVaders assassins made several attempts on Tardis life, but Leia's quick wit not only saved the Viscount, but destroyed the assassins as well. Ultimately Vader was forced to play his hand and cut Tardi down with his lightsaber, only to discover that Viscount Tardi was actually just a droid made in his image and the real Tardi had died months ago. Leia had R2-D2 record video images of the \"murder\" and transmitted them to C-3PO who was at police headquarters in order to prevent Vader from exposing their ruse to the authorities. Leia needed the fake Viscount to secure the loan, and used the Crown Jewels of Alderaan as indisputable collateral. As a precaution, Leia had to manipulate Vader into destroying the duplicate droid of Tardi.\nUnbeknownst to Organa, Darth Vader had manipulated her as he really had no interest in preventing her financial deal for the starfighters; he only wanted to take possession of the priceless Alderaanian jewels. He bribed an officer at the local customs station and acquired the treasure, having only played along with Leia's plan to ensure he could leave the planet without the jewels being missed by the authorities. Nonetheless, Leia secured the funding for the starfighters.\nIn the months that followed, Leia divided her time between missions for the Alliance and the search for Han. At one point, she was forced to stop the search as Skywalker was infected with a lethal disease called \"Crimson Forever\" after boarding an Imperial vessel, finding its crew members crimson-colored and dead. Suspecting a red-glowing stone aboard the ship to be the source of whatever killed the Imperials, Luke rushed back to the Rebel headquarters, but he was already infected. In a short time, Luke was lying comatose, his eyes turned scarlet red. Leia remembered a story Han Solo had told her about the Red Nebula that featured a pair of stones similar to the one that infected Luke. Chewbacca regaled the tale, and the group came to the conclusion that the \"Crimson Forever\" stone was indeed one of those Chewbacca and Han had encountered&mdash;when the two stones were separated, they were extremely lethal. After summoning Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca to the Rebel base on Golrath, the trio set out in the Falcon and ventured to the Red Nebula. Leia and Lando boarded the vessel while Chewbacca waited in the Falcon and immediately saw victims of the \"Crimson Forever\". Convinced that it was nearby, they started looking for the second stone. Their search was cut short, however, when they were captured by a gang of bounty hunters employed by Domina Tagge.Star Wars (1977) 50\nTagge explained that the stones were part of her plan to kill Luke Skywalker as revenge for the death of her brother, Orman Tagge, which Darth Vader had falsely accused Luke of being responsible for. She had hired the bounty hunters to retrieve the stones once word of the deadliness of the red-glowing rocks reached her. Bombing the planet where the stones had been held, she soon had them in her grasp. Shortly afterwards, an Imperial warship loaded with Imperial stormtroopers boarded the Nebula unaware that Tagge had tinkered with the canister of their stone, making it burst open when it was placed under the pressure of hyperspace travel. Tagge managed to coax them into leaving by revealing the location of the Rebel base on Golrath. By the time they arrived near Golrath, they were all dead, and the ghost ship trap was set for Skywalker. However, priest, one of Tagges prisoners, released the stone in Tagges ship from its canister as well, killing many. Domina and a few bounty hunters were able to seal themselves away on the ship, avoiding certain death, but lacking space suits to shield themselves from the disease, they were trapped.\nEscaping Tagge and her crew by jumping through an airlock, Leia and Lando were picked up by the Falcon. Realizing that they needed the stone to cure Luke, Leia struck a deal with Domina&mdash;the Rebels would save her and her bounty hunters from the \"Crimson Forever\"-infested ship, and in return, she would hand over her stone so they could stop the plague. As the crystals were reunited on Golrath, Luke was cured. Domina and her accomplices flew off in an escape ship per the agreement, and the stones were loaded aboard the Imperial ghost ship, which was sent straight into Golrath's sun. The Rebel base, however, was destroyed by Leia to avoid discovery by the Empire.\nShortly afterwards, Leia and Captain Chedaki went to investigate Imperial activity in the Shiva system, but as the two entered a shuttle to go down to the planet Shiva IV, the ship was damaged by a space mine that caused an explosion that killed Chedaki. Leia was forced to launch the damaged shuttle in order to protect the ship and the rest of the crew from harm.Star Wars (1977) 53\nThe shuttle crashed on Shiva IV, soon after Leia was immediately attacked by a savage raiding party. A group of natives led by Aron Peacebringer and K\u00e9ral Longknife repelled the raiders and rescued the princess. After her encounter with the raiding party Leia returned to the capital Illyriaq\u00fcm with Aron, and tried to warn him of the danger that the Galactic Empire posed, but the warlord was not convinced that such an empire existed. But during a gala of Calian nobility, Aron and Leia were both secretly captured by Imperial stormtroopers and brought before General Skar as prisoners. However, Leia and Aron escaped.Star Wars (1977) 54\nSome time later, Organa sought assistance from Prince Xizor of the Black Sun criminal syndicate. In order to get past Imperial security, Organa was disguised as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh, and Chewbacca took on the identity of the Wookiee bounty hunter Snoova. From there the two became guests of Black Suns leader, the Falleen Prince Xizor. Xizor also became enamored of Organa, and attempted to seduce her. He used his pheromones upon her and was succeeding when he was interrupted by Chewbacca, who revealed Xizors scheme to her. Upon returning to Xizors presence, she stalled for time and then quickly rebuffed his advances by kneeing him in the groin, leaving an enraged Xizor who locked her up. Organa was able to escape due to the efforts of Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian and Dash Rendar.Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire'\nUpon discovering that Han Solo was being held captive in Jabbas Palace, Organa once again posed as the bounty hunter Boushh and entered into Jabbas demolition games in order to increase her credibility with the Hutt as well as to prove that she was in fact the notorious bounty hunter. When she arrived at Jabbas Palace, she discovered two of the Alliances best pilots weere already present, the twin sisters Tia and Ghia. The twins had been captured by Jabba after they abandoned the Rebellion in order to mount their own rescue for Solo and were enslaved by Jabba as punishment. Near the end of the tournament, she risked her own mission to rescue her fellow Rebels, and managed to get them off Tatooine and back to the Alliance on a transport ship right outside Jabbas Palace.Star Wars: Demolition It was because of her participation in this tournament that she was able to perform the role of Chewbaccas captor in order to infiltrate Jabba's Palace. She played her role well, for the urging of more money led the Hutt to believe \"he\" was his kind of scum. However, in order to convince the ruthless Hutt, Organa coldly held an armed thermal detonator ticking down its time until it blew unless Jabba agreed to a higher bounty. Chewbacca was sent to the dungeon while Organa remained in the palace.\nOnce Jabbas court had gone to sleep, Organa freed Solo from carbonite, only to be caught by Jabba. Han was thrown into a cell with Chewbacca. Calrissian, disguised as one of Jabbas guards, tried to sneak away with Organa, but Jabba demanded she be brought to him instead.Episode VI novel Organa warned the gangster that he would regret capturing her, but he ignored the threat and licked her face. He then ordered his dancers to remove her clothing and put a Huttese slave-girl costume on her while the Max Rebo Band played music. Now a slave in Jabbas court, Organa was kept beside the Hutt using a metal chain. Rebo later gave her a blatberry pie because he thought she looked malnourished.\nLater, Calrissian came to check on Organa. While she assured him that she was alright, she also expressed her discomfort. Calrissian decided it would be unwise to make another escape attempt until Skywalkers arrival, though they both hoped he would appear soon. Organa admitted that she worried her safety would be in jeopardy if she had to dance for Jabba.Return of the Jedi' radio drama\nThe night after her capture, Jabba sent Organa to Boba Fett's room to entertain him. However, Fett was not interested in the enslaved princess and instead gave her a sheet to cover herself. Organa offered to pay the bounty hunter to help them escape, but he declined. The two then debated the morality of her friends and the Rebellion. Eventually, Fett grew tired of arguing with her and went to sleep. Organa was returned to Jabba the next morning.\nDuring Organas enslavement, Jabbas chef Porcellus took pity on her and offered to sneak her food. He also prepared meals for Solo to help his recovery from hibernation sickness, earning Organas thanks. However, Jabba became suspicious of Porcellus and accused the chef of putting fierfek&mdash;a hex&mdash;in his food. To help clear Porcelluss name, Organa ate a sample of the sandmaggot kidneys he prepared for the Hutt. Unfortunately, the food was indigestible to humans and quickly made her nauseated, much to Jabbas amusement.\nAfter one of Jabbas late-night parties, Organa was sleeping alongside the Hutt on his throne when Skywalker arrived to rescue everyone. They were awoken by the majordomo, Bib Fortuna, who was acting under the influence of Skywalkers mind-trick. Organa watched as Skywalker tried to bargain with her master, but Jabba refused to negotiate and dropped him into a pit with his pet rancor. To Organas relief, Skywalker killed the monster; however, a furious Jabba hassled her. In retaliation for killing his rancor, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca to be taken to the Great Pit of Carkoon and fed to the sarlacc. Unlike her friends, Organa was to be kept alive and remain in Jabbas possession.\nJabba brought Organa with him on his sail barge to Carkoon, while her friends rode on a skiff. During the ride, she was allowed to leave Jabba's side to watch her friends from a window. Eventually, Jabba wanted her back and started tugging on her chain. Annoyed, Organa glared at him and returned to watching. Jabba then pulled her chain harder, forcing her to run to him on his throne. The crime lord bragged that she would soon learn to appreciate him and made her drink with him.\nWhen they reached the pit, Skywalker escaped once again and started attacking with his new lightsaber. As Jabbas guards fell into the sarlacc, Organa made her move. She crushed the light that lit up the barge and turned it into a pitch-black frenzy. As everyone was too preoccupied to help Jabba, Organa hopped over him and strangled him to death with the very chain that held her captive. R2-D2 then cut her chains and she joined Skywalker on the top deck of the sail barge. From there she pointed the deck gun at the barge and swung away to safety with him as the craft exploded.\n\n\u2022 Endor and a shocking revelation\n\nLeia Organa and Luke Skywalker\nAfter leaving Tatooine, Leia joined the gathered Rebel fleet near Sullust, and accompanied General Crix Madines commando force to the forest moon of Endor where the Death Star IIs shield generator was located. Mon Mothma, alliance leader, and Admiral Ackbar explained that the superweapon was protected by a deflector shield on the forest moon of Endor, and that while a strike team including Luke, Han, and Leia sabotaged the shield, a fighter team would penetrate the main reactor.\nSoon after Leia accompanied Luke and Han to Endor, using a stolen Imperial Shuttle to bypass the Super Star Destroyer Executor. On Endor, Leia and Luke confronted stormtroopers, attempted to ride speeder bikes back to an Imperial Base. In order to make sure their arrival was kept secret, Leia jumped on a speeder bike, with Luke in tow, and chased them throughout Endor's dense forests. Leia was able to shoot down one but was also shot down herself and collapsed. After falling off of her stolen speeder bike, she was found by a curious Ewok named Wicket Wystri Warrick, a local to the sanctuary moon of Endor. Soon after a stormtrooper attacked them, but Leia and Wicket were able to subdue him. To keep her safe, Wicket took Leia to his village.\nWorried, Han, Luke, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO searched the forest, only to be captured by Ewoks, however, the Ewoks saw Threepio as a god. Taken to Bright Tree Village as a feast to honor Threepio, Leia reunited with her friends and tried, unsuccessfully, to convince them to let her friends go. Fortunately 3PO was able to persuade them to let Han, Luke, Chewbacca, and R2 go, with the help of Skywalker. Later on, the Ewoks accepted them as part of their tribe.\nThe night before the battle, Organa received news that forever changed her life. Her long-time \"friend\", Luke Skywalker, asked Leia if she remembered her biological mother. Leia explained that her mother had died when she was very young. Though she had some memory of her, they were only \"images\" and \"feelings.\" She recalled her mother as being \"very beautiful, kind, but sad\". Luke confided that he had no memory of his mother. He then revealed to her that they were brother and sister, and that the fallen Jedi, Darth Vader, was their father. After Luke revealed to her of their relationship, Leia told Luke that she had somehow knew that Luke was her brother. When Luke told Leia that he had to confront Darth Vader, still stricken with shock, she tried to convince him to just \"run far away\" instead, but Luke had already made up his mind and left her deeply shocked.\nLeia fought alongside Han in the battle that followed, though she was injured with a blaster wound to her upper arm during the fighting. They were able to infiltrate the shield generator, but Imperial reinforcements arrived and they were captured. But with the help of Chewbacca and a tribe of ewok warriors, they managed to escape. Even with this injury, Leia was able to push down a stormtrooper with her foot and shoot two others who attempted to capture her and Han at the shield bunker. The mission to Endor was eventually a success, and the Death Star II was destroyed in the epochal Battle of Endor when Lando Calrissian and Nien Nunb, piloting the Millennium Falcon, flew into the station's core and destroyed it from the inside. Following the battle, Leia informed Han of her familial relationship with Luke, and the two shared a kiss as the explosion of the Death Star lit the skies above.\n\n\u2022 Founding of the New Republic (4&ndash;8 ABY)\n\n\u2022 Truce at Bakura\n\nThe Truce at Bakura\nwith Imperial Governor Wilek Nereus]]\nImmediately after the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance answered a distress call from Bakura, which was under invasion by the Ssi-ruuk. Leia and Han Solo also struggled to find some time together and hash out their newly-formed relationship. Leia discovered that Bakura chafed under Imperial rule. The remaining Imperial forces were outnumbered and outgunned by Ssi-Ruuk invaders, and the result was a truce between the Imperials and the Rebels. While meeting with sympathetic Bakuran Senate officials, Leia was arrested for sedition by Imperial governor Wilek Nereus and was imprisoned in an out-of-the-way complex. She was rescued by a typically crazy stunt by Han Solo. Returning to orbit in the Falcon, the Alliance forces helped beat back the Ssi-ruuk but were then betrayed by Nereus. As Han grimly prepared to ram the Falcon into an Imperial vessel to allow the other Rebels to escape, he ordered Leia to an escape pod, but she refused. Fortunately, Luke was able to convince the Imperial fleet commander Pter Thanas to surrender. Leia then aided the short, swift Bakuran overthrow of the government and was present at the surrender of Nereus. While on Bakura, the spirit of Anakin Skywalker appeared to Leia to beg for her forgiveness, which she would not, or could not grant at that time, since she had just learned of her parentage, and the fact that he was Darth Vader. Shortly afterwards, the Alliance of Free Planets was formed.\n\n\u2022 Nagai-Tof War\n\nStar Wars (1977) 88]]\nAs the Empire was crippled and the Alliance of Free Planets was founded, Leia embarked on several missions to secure the new order. But before Leia and the newly formed Alliance of free planets could reverse the changes done by the Empire, she was caught up in the Nagai\u2013Tof War.\nTraveling to several worlds with Mon Mothma, Leia became embroiled in the events surrounding the Battle of Herdessa. Almost immediately after Leia had pledged her support, she was thrust into an open conflict between Lumiyas forces and the Herdessan Rebels. Personally leading a large group of Herdessan shocktroopers, Lumiya burst into the Rebels base. Nearly all the Rebels were incapacitated by stun beams in the firefight, but Leia and the Herdessan resistance leader Suzu were able to escape from the battle. Realizing that Leia and the Rebels were a threat Lumiya ordered the residents to track her down.\nThe Herdessan Rebel Finn was soon detained and Lumiya prepared to execute him. Luckily, Suzu and Leia created a diversion that delayed the execution and allowed Leia to ambush Lumiyas guards. As Leia distracted the guards, Suzu released the rest of the prisoners and a final fight broke out between Lumiyas men and the now armed rebels. As the Rebels and the Imperial exchanged blaster fire, the remaining Herdessan citizens seized the opportunity to rise up against Lumiya and her corrupt allies. Attacking the Imperials from the rear, the Herdessan citizens quickly subdued their former oppressors and ended the battle.\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of a new government, certain members began to talk amongst themselves about the manner in which the leadership of the Alliance was run, claiming it was too oppressive. The leaders of the discontent parties gathered on Kabray to share their concerns with one another. Admiral Gial Ackbar dispatched Princess Leia and Han Solo, along with four Zeltrons as an escort, to the gathering to listen to their concerns and show them the leadership was not aloof, not deaf to their concerns.Star Wars (1977) 95\nThe Nagai leadership targeted this gathering as an opportunity to disrupt the Alliances diplomatic base and dispatched 13 Nagai warriors, led by Knife, to round up the non-combatants. The Nagai arrived before the Alliance reps and easily captured the party of diplomats. When Leia and Han finally arrived they walked right into a trap and were captured without a fight. While they tried to formulate a plan involving Leia pretending to faint, the Zeltron boys set their own trap. They hoisted Jahn up to the ceiling where he wedged himself in the corner above the door. When a Nagai guard entered the room, he jumped on him, knocking him to the ground. The remaining Zeltrons rushed out of the cell and attacked the remaining Nagai in a fierce brawl. Leia and Han appropriated blasters from downed Nagai and joined in on the fighting. Eventually, the Nagai were all rounded up and captured by the Alliance team.\nThings went from bad to worse when Princess Leias transport was caught in the crossfire and forced to make an emergency landing on Trenwyth. There she found the injured Nagai soldier Tai, whom she nursed back to full health, before both parties made their separate ways, leaving the planet in the clutches of the Tof.Star Wars (1977) 103 Unaware of an oncoming Nagai assault, Leia and the others had rendezvoused on Zeltros, where they were hoping to persuade the Zeltron leaders, Arno and Leonie, to join the war effort. To celebrate the arrival of the Free Alliance heroes, the Zeltron leaders threw a grand party. However, Nagai lieutenant Den Siva and the Nagai forces gate-crashed the festivities, capturing Leia and her friend Dani.Star Wars (1977) 104 The Tof also happened upon Den Siva, and blackmailed Siva into leading his Nagai forces and their prisoners into a Tof ambush&mdash;leaving Leia and Dani in the clutches of the Tof.Star Wars (1977) 105 Fortunately, Leia and Danis sneak attack gave the prisoners a chance to strike back at the Tof. Rallied by Lando, the prisoners were able to defeat the Tof forces, and in the aftermath of the carnage, Den Siva emerged, with an offer to join the Alliance.Star Wars' (1977) 106\nThe final battle of the war came at the Battle of Saijo after the Alliance allied with the Nagai against the Tofs. It was during this battle that Leia would again encounter Lumiya, formerly Shira Brie. The war ended when the prince of the Tof, Sereno, surrendered and Lumiya being betrayed by a the Tof soldier Bey.Star Wars (1977) 107\n\n\u2022 Leader of the New Republic\n\nPrincess Leia Organa was a founding member of the New Republic, which was formally promulgated in 5 ABY. Her first New Republic position was Minister of State, which she served as during the taking of Coruscant by the New Republic. Also, she served as Councilor during the Thrawn crisis. She went on to succeed Mon Mothma as its Chief of State, and later filled other offices, such as Minister of Defense, and various diplomatic posts. Although most of her life was devoted to such matters of state, she engaged in limited study of the Jedi arts, with her twin brother Luke Skywalker as her teacher. Notably, she wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber that she built herself, and then in 18 ABY Luke gave her a ruby-red lightsaber to complement the weapon she had constructed earlier. Because of her duties as leader of the New Republic, Leia became more of Jedi Consular than a Jedi Guardian.\nRight after the founding of the New Republic, the false Prophet of the Dark Side known as Kadann foretold that the chosen heir to the Galactic Empire would present himself bearing the glove of Darth Vader. An Imperial Grand Moff, Bertroff Hissa, heard the prophecy and used it to proclaim Palpatines son, Trioculus, as the new Galactic Emperor. Now Emperor, Trioculus asked for Leias hand in marriage. Leia accompanied her brother on his mission to locate the Glove of Darth Vader, a rare gauntlet once owned by her father.The Glove of Darth Vader\nSometime after 5 ABY, Zorba the Hutt was set free from his prison holding cell, after his prison on Kip was infiltrated. He found out about his son Jabbas death and vowed revenge on Leia, Han, Luke and the others responsible. He had one of his hunters, Cobak, kidnap Princess Leia, who was vacationing at the Fun World. Zorba, finally face-to-face with Leia, introduced himself as Jabba the Hutts father, and vowed to take her to the Great Pit of Carkoon, where he would feed her to the Sarlacc. En route to Tatooine, the Zorbas Express was captured by the Imperial Moffship, and both Leia and Zorba were captured. They dropped Zorba into the Pit, but he was spit out, and Leia got a low priority bounty on her head in the years to come.Zorba the Hutt's Revenge\nSoon after, Leia was kidnapped by Kadann, who planned to turn her to the dark side and make her Queen of the Empire. Fortunately Leia was rescued and with her help, Luke and the others were able to find Palpatines real son, Triclops, and subdue Trioculus and Grand Moff Hissa.Queen of the Empire'\nAs the New Republic grew in size and legitimacy, Organa sat on its Provisional Council as a representative from Alderaan. Her brother designed a regimen of Jedi training exercises for her, although she rarely found the time or the peace of mind to do them. While the military prepared itself for a conquest of Coruscant, Organa made attempts through numerous channels to contact the Imperial Warlord Zsinj, including the Imperial HoloNet and several levels within Zsinjs own organization. Wanting to gauge how strong the New Republic was, Zsinj rebuffed her every time. With no permanent headquarters, the Provisional council convened on Noquivzor at the request of Senator Borsk Feylya, holding a meeting that Wedge Antilles was permitted to attend. Organa sought out Antilles after the meeting, and caught up with her old friend before being called away by Mon Mothma.X-Wing: Wedges Gamble\nCoruscant was soon after taken by the New Republic, and became the permanent headquarters for the previously mobile Provisional Council. As Councilor Sian Tevv had been exposed to the Krytos virus, the councils meetings were punctuated by a light bacta mist circulating through the air. At one such meeting, Antilles appeared before the council, and pleaded with them to drop murder charges leveled against Tycho Celchu following the death of Rogue Squadron pilot Corran Horn. Remaining silent while he pled his case, Organa proposed a recess, and remained in the chamber with Antilles during the break, informing him that the spread of the Krytos Virus had nearly bankrupted a fragile New Republic, and that Celchus trial had to proceed in order to keep public opinion of the government from collapsing. With the New Republic close to falling apart, Organa secretly headed to the Hapes Cluster in order to ask their ruling Consortium for aid.X-Wing: The Krytos Trap\n\n\u2022 Disastrous courtship\n\nLeia, now busy with Minister of State duties while Han was away for a few months fighting Warlord Zsinj, caused a significant rift between the two. During this time, Leia had been conducting negotiations with the Hapes Consortium and was visited by the Hapes delegation at the time of Hans return. They presented Leia with a total of 63 different gifts&mdash;one from each Hapan world&mdash;including a Hapan Gun of Command, rainbow gems from Gallinore, a plant which promoted longevity and intelligence, several Star Destroyers, and last, the hand of the Hapes cluster ruler Taa Chume's son, Prince Isolder, in matrimony&mdash;which Leia seriously considered, as Isolder was handsome, well-mannered, and, most importantly, would provide both the New Republic and the Alderaanian exiles a great deal of benefit.\nJealous, Han kidnapped Leia and took her to Dathomir, a planet he had won in a high-stakes sabacc game. During the flight, Leia was hostile and icy towards Han for abandoning his responsibilities. To make amends, Han promised to return and accept whatever punishment was deserved if she would spend a week with him and did not love him by the end. However, they found out that the planet was owned by Zsinj and were shot down onto Dathomir, which was interdicted. They encountered the Singing Mountain Clan of Dathomiri witches and set to work repairing the Millennium Falcon. They met up with Luke and Isolder, who had come to rescue them but were also trapped on the planet, and sparks flew between Han and Isolder again. However, the Nightsisters had a plan to capture the Falcon and get off the planet, so Leia had to put all her effort into getting off the planet rather than over which man she should marry. Soon afterwards a battle broke out, which resulted in the end of Zsinj and his army and the marriage between Han Solo and Leia Organa.\nAfter the near-disastrous courtship, Leia married Han Solo in 8 ABY. Mon Mothma officiated the wedding. To start their honeymoon, Han Solo took Leia to see the Corphelion Comets and even managed, albeit in a typical unorthodox manner, to get the romantic view all to themselves. At first, she did not want to have children, as she feared they would turn out like her father, however she would soon discover the truth. Leia and Han, disguised with false prints and retina-concealing contact lenses as a blue-skinned Twilek and a red-skinned Devaronian respectively, went on an important mission to Tatooine to retrieve the Alderaanian moss painting Killik Twilight and the Shadowcast key hidden within it. It was there that Leia came across her fathers childhood friend Kitster Banai in the Valley of the Spirits. With Banais help, Leia discovered her grandmothers holojournal and the location of the moss painting. After speaking to Banai and another of her fathers childhood friends, Wald, and reading her grandmother Shmis diary, Leia discovered her father had not been born or raised as the evil monster she had known, and decided that there was nothing inherently evil in the Skywalker bloodline.Tatooine Ghost Soon afterwards, she became pregnant with twins.\n\n\u2022 Return of the Empire (9&ndash;19 ABY)\n\n\u2022 Thrawn campaign\n\nLeia, to Han Solo\nA year later during the Thrawn Crisis, Grand Admiral Thrawn ordered Noghri commandos to kidnap the pregnant Leia in exchange for Joruus Cbaoths help, who attempted several times to capture her. Cbaoth had planned to turn Leia and her brother Luke to the dark side and make them his apprentices. To avoid capture she hid on the planet Kashyyyk, but her would-be kidnappers tracked her and unsuccessfully tried to abduct her. She later learned that Darth Vader once landed on the Noghri home planet Honoghr and tricked the Noghri into serving the Empire by promising to help their planet recover from the ecological disaster that it suffered during the Clone Wars. Because of this, they were fiercely loyal to Vader and later to Thrawn, his successor. The Noghri discovered Leia was the biological daughter of Darth Vader by her bloodline scent, and went to Honoghr and convince the Noghri of the Empires deception. They left the service of the Empire and became allies of New Republic. Leia was addressed as \"The Lady Vader\" among the Noghri and both she and her family became revered figures in their society, to the point where Leia, known to the Noghri as the Malaryush, or \"Daughter of the Savior\", was granted a permanent bodyguard of lethal Noghri warriors.Dark Force Rising\nAlso, during the Thrawn crisis, Leia gave birth to the twins Jaina,The Last Command named after Hans mother,Routine and Jacen on Coruscant. Despite her pregnancy and later her newborn children, Leia continued to play a pivotal role in the fledgling New Republic as Thrawns depredations threatened the security of the galaxy. Leia helped get Garm Bel Iblis the command of Coruscants defense forces after Thrawn laid siege to the planet and also helped root out the mysterious Delta Source that had given the Imperials so much vital intelligence. Finally, Leia helped procure the aid of Talon Karrde to the New Republic, authorizing payments to the smuggler to get his help and information. Karrde would later ask Han Solo, after Solo said it took Leia to bring him to the Alliance, if she had any sisters. During the later part of the Rebel Alliance and the early part of the New Republic, Princess Leia was highly popular among both the rank-and-file Alliance fighters and the leaders. After the twins were born, prior to the deaths of Thrawn and Cbaoth, Imperial Intelligence agents staged one last unsuccessful attempt to apprehend Leia and the twins.\n\n\u2022 Return of Palpatine\n\nAmbush at Corellia'\nIn 10 ABY, she discovered to her horror that Palpatine was alive and that her brother had turned to the dark side. After learning of Palpatines return, Leia went to Nar Shaddaa where she encountered the old Jedi, Vima-Da-Boda, who told her the tale of her fall and bequeathed to Leia a box containing a 10,000 year old lightsaber.Star Wars: Dark Empire\nTraveling to Byss to rescue Luke with Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO, she got the four of them captured. Palpatine was quick to try taking advantage of this and attempted to turn her. Showing her the ancient Jedi Holocron of Bodo Baas to tempt her, and stirring her anger by revealing that he intended to make her unborn child his next receptacle, his attempt backfired and Leia flipped over his bed and fled, stealing the Holocron. She then encountered Luke.\nLuke revealed that he had faked his turn and had been working to sabotage Palpatine's plans from the inside. Aiding in the escape of her, Han, Chewie and C-3PO, he sent R2-D2 back with them, having downloaded the master control codes for the World Devastators ravaging Mon Calamari into him. He then said that he would remain on Byss to attempt to assassinate the Emperor. After they fled, Luke went through with the attempt and failed.\nAfter the battle of Mon Calamari, Palpatine and a broken Luke arrived in his flagship, the Eclipse at Pinnacle Base, where the New Republic was celebrating. While Leia was studying the Holocron in her quarters, the simulacrum of Bodo Baas told her a prophecy written by his Master, which foretold the upcoming events. Palpatine demanded the presence of Leia and the return of the Holocron. Leia met with the Sith aboard the Eclipse. Luke then implored for Leias help in shaking off the Dark Side. Leia aided him and Luke managed to return to the light. Palpatine was enraged and engaged Luke in a brutal lightsaber duel. As Leia observed their duel, she gave energy to Luke through the use of battle meditation and together they were able to subdue Palpatine. When Palpatine summoned a Force storm against the New Republic fleet in retaliation, Luke and Leia summoned a wave of light side energy and enveloped Palpatine in it, cutting off his control of the storm. While the storm destroyed Eclipse and Palpatine, they fled.\nof Bodo Baas.]]\nAfter the death of Palpatines clone on Byss, Leia returned to Nar Shaddaa to remove Vima and extract from her knowledge of the holocrons and the destroyed Jedi Order.Star Wars: Dark Empire II'\nAfter fleeing to Nespis VIII, Leias second son was born and named Anakin after his grandfather Anakin Skywalker. Leia, who had been hesitant to tap into her Force potential, learned the valuable techniques from Vima, including how to shield the newborn Anakin. This skill allowed Leia to save him from being possessed by the spirit of Palpatine. With the reborn Palpatines clone body rapidly deteriorating, she was forced to flee to Onderon to hide Anakin Solo from him. The Emperor did eventually find her, but he was shot in the back, and a sacrifice from Empatojayos Brand saved them from Palpatines spirit.\nLeia loved all three of her children dearly, but because of her position as Chief of State, she had barely enough time to devote to her family. As a result of kidnapping attempts, Leia sent the children to various safe worlds where they were put in the care of her most trusted friend, Winter. Though they were safe, the children, especially Jaina, missed her dearly. However, when they returned to their parents, the children viewed Leia as a stranger and wanted to believe that Winter was their mother. Jaina would begin to notice her distance from her family, leading to a big rift between them years later.\nAlthough her sibling relationship to Luke Skywalker&mdash;and their relationship to Darth Vader&mdash;became public knowledge, she remained known as the heir to Bail Organa, and thus a member of the Royal House of Alderaan. She played an important role for those Alderaanians who still lived, having been offworld at the time of the planet's destruction. She founded New Alderaan, over which the Royal House of Alderaan, in the person of Leia Organa Solo and her children, continued to hold sovereignty. The government on New Alderaan also administered their former Alderaan system.\n\n\u2022 Jedi search\n\nChampions of the Force\nIn 11 ABY, when her brother Luke was disabled by Kyp Durron and the spirit of an ancient Sith Lord named Exar Kun, Leia and the family went to visit the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 and were baffled by his condition. During the dinner that followed, Leia, along with the twins and the students felt a great disturbance in the Force when the planet of Carida was destroyed by Kyp Durron. Leia helped the Jedi students make plans to deal with Exar Kun to save Luke.\nAlso during this time, Terpfen was being used by the Empire to locate Leia's youngest son on Anoth. During which she also had the twins with her and had to chose between the twins and Anakin. Cilghal, said she would help take care of the twins and so Leia and Terpfen set off to see Admiral Ackbar, since he was, along with Luke, the only person who knew where Anoth was.\nAfter having the Admiral with them, they set out to Anoth to find Imperials searching for Anakin. Leia sought to the Force and found out that her son was still on the planet along with her best friend Winter, who had been exiled there. After she landed, Leia confronted the Admiral who was taking her child. She was very menacing toward him, although he had started to strangle her son. When the Admiral tripped, Terpfen grabbed the baby and handed him to Leia. Leia was so relieved, she could do nothing else but cry and rock her son.\nMon Mothmas health began to decline that year. No one could discover the source of her illness until Terpfen, Admiral Ackbars chief mechanic, told her that the Caridan Ambassador Furgan had poisoned her. With that knowledge, the Jedi healer Cilghal healed her by removing the poison drop by drop. Leia replaced Mon Mothma as Chief of State at this time.\nThe next year as Luke began the process of restoring the Jedi Order, Leia, Han, and Chewbacca set out on a mission of their own, vital to the survival of the fragile New Republic. They begin searching for the long-lost children of the Jedi. The quest took them to the Jedi planet of Belsavis, a nearly forgotten frozen world. Having heard tales of a Jedi exodus from the dark crypts below the planet's surface and also hearing that since the time of the exodus no one entering the crypts has returned alive, Leia went to Belsavis to start her search.\n\n\u2022 Planet of twilight\n\nDuring the Death Seed plague crisis in 13 ABY Leia was kidnapped by Seti Ashgad and was taken to Nam Chorios, the home of Tsils and the strange alien lifeform, droch. She was held captive by Beldorion, a Hutt Dark Jedi. Beldorion told her stories of the ancient Jedi Masters such as Thon and Yoda, whose power he admired, if not their principles. Despite the fact that his Force abilities were greatly boosted by the planet, Beldorion was killed by Leia in a lightsaber duel. Leia managed to escape and was reunited with Han, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, and Lando Calrissian.\nAshgad and Moff Tol Getelles had planned to devastate the Meridian sector through the use of the Death Seed. However, their efforts were foiled by Leia and Luke. Soon afterwards Leia participated in the Battle of Nam Chorios. The battle ended when Luke managed to convince the Chorian crystal mind of the threat that Ashgad posed to the galaxy if his plans succeeded. As a result, Ashgad was killed, though Getelles still survived.\n\n\u2022 Waru\n\nDuring the Empire Reborn movement of 14 ABY, while on a diplomatic mission to the planet Munto Codru, Jaina, Jacen and Anakin were kidnapped by Lord Hethrir, the Imperial Procurator of Justice, in a fiendish plot to take advantage of their Force powers and sacrifice young Anakin to the creature Waru. To get them back, Leia disguised herself as a pirate, assuming her childhood nickname \"Lelila\" as her alias. Along with Chewbacca and Artoo, she followed the kidnappers trail to a disabled refugee ship, from which children were also missing. It was here that she learned of Hethrirs twisted plan to restore the Empire.\nAs she followed the path of her children across space, Luke and Han arrived on Crseih Station in order to discover the secret of Warus sinister cult. While in the process of rescuing her children, Leia freed Hethrirs mate Rillao, whose son Tigris was with Hethrir. She arrived on Hethrirs worldcraft on her yacht Alderaan', rescued the twins and then loaded all the other children aboard the ship before leaving for Crseih Station to rescue Anakin. In the end, Waru destroyed Hethrir before vanishing from the known galaxy following a confrontation with Leia, Han and Luke.\nAlso in 14 ABY, Chewbacca was seen in Mos Eisley in a diplomatic mission for Leia. She, however, was not present in Tatooine at the time, and it is not known if Chewbacca retrieved any useful information during the mission.Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy\n\n\u2022 Black Fleet Crisis\n\nBefore the Storm'\nChief of State Organa Solo guided the New Republic through a number of dangerous external crises from post-Imperial warlords. As the threat of Imperial warlords shrank and the New Republics growth accelerated rapidly, she also faced a number of internal political conflicts in the Third Electoral.Tyrant's Test\nDuring the Black Fleet Crisis in 16 ABY, Leia faced a ruthless leader of the Duskhan League, an arrogant Yevetha who seemed bent on a genocidal war that could shatter the fragile unity of the New Republic. To end this threat Leia called upon the Senate to take a stand and eliminate the Yevetha threat, even at the cost of Hans life.\nUsing the New Republics lack of intelligence on the Dushkan League and Senatorial political infighting to his advantage, Nil Spaar extended his negotiations with Chief of State Solo over a period of weeks. Pressured by military and intelligence advisors who sought answers, and potentially an ally against the Core Imperial strongholds, Organa Solo entered the discussions, only to find herself on the receiving end of a political plot to throw the New Republic into confusion. These two forces came to a head, Leia had no choice but to invoke the Article Five of the Common Charter to forestall a recall vote against her office and declare war against the Yevetha. Cracks in Leias widespread popularity began to show during this period, cracks that would accelerate with the political ascendance of Borsk Feylya.\n\n\u2022 Almanian Uprising\n\nThe New Rebellion'\nHowever, these \"cracks\" would soon resurface in the Almanian Uprising. Leia Organa Solo, Chief of State of the New Republic and President of the Senate, had been under intense pressure from the Black Fleet Crisis political situation. As a result, there were many attempts on her life. Leia, however, was determined to put it behind her. Her new term of the Senate added several new ex-Imperial Senators and ex-Imperial worlds, such as the Senator for Exodeen. Despite reassurance from Mon Mothma, she was unsure of the situation. As Leia took the podium and started into an inspired speech, powerful bombs rocked the Imperial Palace Senate chamber. Leia was knocked off her feet, over a hundred Senators were dead or wounded and Leia herself had lost her hearing.\nMore disturbingly to Leia, as she recovered she sensed Luke, in trouble and injured. She had planned to find him incognito, but Mon Mothma sent along a fleet under the command of Wedge Antilles to help her. She found Luke on Almania, where they along with Han, confronted the fallen Jedi student Kueller. Leia accidentally left her brother behind after she rushed ahead not realizing that Luke was still weak. In those moments when they were apart, Kueller found Luke and forced a lightsaber duel. Leia came back to find both locked in combat. Terribly weakened, Luke abruptly decided to give up. As Kueller raised his lightsaber to strike Luke down, he lost his connection to the Force. Kueller tried to use his anger to tap into the Force, but doing so was useless, since a thernbee that had swallowed an ysalamir nutrient frame had wandered into the general vicinity. He had one last trick up his sleeve, though: he used a remote to send the signal to self-destruct his remaining droids. However, Kuellers last gasp of malice was thwarted thanks to the efforts of R2-D2, C-3PO, and young mechanic Cole Fardreamer. As Kueller had attempted to activate his remaining bombs, Leia shot him. She removed the death mask from his lifeless body, revealing Dolphs boyish face.\n\n\u2022 First Corellian Insurrection\n\nIn 18 ABY Leia and her family took a vacation to Han Solos home planet of Corellia. While the dust of the defeated Empire settled, Chief of State Leia Organa Solo announced a major trade conference on Corellia, the President of the Senate determined to bring Corellia back to its previous state. Once there they learned of the Human League, headed by Hans cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo and the Sacorrian Triad. The Human League and the Sacorrian Triad joined forces causing the First Corellian Insurrection.\nThrackan managed to imprison Leia and Han while he kidnapped their children. During her imprisonment, Leia met with Mara Jade and the two plotted their escape from the Corona House. With the help of Jades ship, Jades Fire and their own ingenious plan, the two successfully decided to retreat to Selonia, hoping the children were safe with Chewbacca.\nOn Selonia, Leia, Mara and Han attempted to convince the Selonians to change their mind&mdash;and they too were imprisoned for a short time. Sinisterly, Thrackan dropped the jamming field long enough to show Leia a hologram of him with her children in custody&mdash;to the immense outrage of the Selonians. The Overden immediately released the three just as Luke arrived and began planning a course of action. Meanwhile, Leias youngest son Anakin managed to stop the destruction the Centerpoint Station was causing.Showdown at Centerpoint'\nDespite Leias brave actions throughout the crisis, she received criticism for interfering in Corellias attempt to achieve independence, prompting her to resign as Chief of State.*The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse\n\n\u2022 Caamas Document Crisis\n\nDuring this time she became involved in the Caamas Document crisis in 19 ABY, in which Thrawn presumably came back from the dead. While on Wayland during a leave of absence from the position of Chief of State, Leia became entangled with a Devaronian who had found a datacard and wanted to keep it under the Debble Agreement. He claimed to be working for Talon Karrde, but did not recognize the smuggler chief. After offering to sell it to her for a ridiculous price, he threw a smoke grenade and tried to escape, but was caught and forced to land by the Wild Karrde. That datacard turned out to reveal that Bothans had been involved in the attack on Caamas. She served as a Councilor on the New Republic High Council during the leave of absence. Ponc Gavrisom served as New Republic Chief of State during her leave.Specter of the Past\nLeia was also irritated to learn that Han had taken her place in negotiations between the Ishori and Diamala, which he characteristically handled with his usual subtlety and diplomatic skill&mdash;next to none. Leia also visited Bothawui with Han to investigate the Bothan Clans to try and find the names of the Bothans involved as well as the financial well-being of the clans. During their stay, Han was blamed for a riot instigated by Imperial Intelligence and the Solos left the planet.\nWhile still on her leave of absence to spend more time on her Jedi training, Han arranged a vacation to the sleepy Pakrik system. When traveling near the backwater world of Pakrik Minor, the Millennium Falcon was attacked by assassins. However, they were rescued by a sleeper of cell of clones, including Carib Devist, that Thrawn held left on Pakrik Minor. In exchange for their silence, they helped fix the Falcon and allowed Han and Leia to leave. Shortly afterwards, a shuttle containing Elegos AKla and Ghent arrived with news that Admiral Pellaeon wanted to discuss a peace treaty. Leia immediately left with the Caamasi and Ghent, along with her Noghri bodyguard. Leia had successfully managed to discuss the treaty preliminarily with Pellaeon, but returned to find fleets of warships facing off over Bothawui.Vision of the Future'\nLeia was on board one of the Ishori ships in place around Bothawui as part of the hostile standoff over the planet when Imperial saboteurs successfully lowered the shield around Drevstarn and used a captured weapons cluster on one of the ships to bombard the planet. Then the Imperials lured each of the fleets into attacking the other. As full-scale battle threatened, Leia sensed danger and worry from Han in the Falcon', who had been trapped by an Imperial Star Destroyer that was cloaked. She started moving the Ishori ship towards the threat, which absolutely incensed the Ishori captain. However, just as Leia was about to charged with mutiny under Ishori war-law, President Gavrisom stepped in and nationalized the warship using an obscure New Republic law. The Imperial ships, expecting to surprise the Rebels after the fleets had already battered each other, were surprised to find a united fleet attacking them led by Lando Calrissian, who Leia had selected.\nAfter receiving the Caamas Document, Leia began talks with Admiral Pellaeon that led to Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty and an end to the Galactic Civil War. Once the Caamas Document crisis was dealt with, Leia, along with Mirax Terrik Horn and Iella Wessiri Antilles, took some time off to help Mara Jade prepare for her wedding to Luke. Leia along with her family attended Lukes wedding on Coruscant, where she helped stop an assassination attempt.Star Wars: Union'\nIn 21 ABY Leia Organa Solo was elected back into office of Chief of State of the New Republic.\nAll three of her children were trained as Jedi at Luke Skywalkers Jedi Praxeum from 22 ABY, and would defend the galaxy from the Yuuzhan Vong War as part of the New Jedi Order. In 24 ABY Leia and her children, Jaina and Jacen, were able to stop the Diversity Alliance, an anti-Human organization, from wreaking havoc. Unfortunately, Leias role as Chief of State came to an end when Borsk Fey'lya succeeded her as the leader of the New Republic.\n\n\u2022 The Yuuzhan Vong War (25&ndash;29 ABY)\n\n\u2022 A new threat\n\nThe New Jedi Order: Star by Star\nAfter serving a second term, Leia resigned as Chief of State, and was succeeded by Borsk Feylya. After the death of Chewbacca on Sernpidal in 25 ABY,The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime Leia went before the Senate to bring attention to the fact that the approaching Yuuzhan Vong were a threat to the galaxy. Her pleas went unheeded, and the invasion continued full force.The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught Leia contributed to the war effort by aiding in the evacuations of Dubrillion and Dantooine, finally getting help from the Advisory Council via Admiral Traest Krefeys threat to place her into power via launching a military coup d\u00e9tat.The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin Soon after she joined SELCORE, a movement that aided refugees.The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Heros Trial\nLeia and her husband suffered a brief period of estrangement some months after the death of Chewbacca; her husband was still struggling with his grief and rage over the death of his longtime friend. After the death of Chewbacca, Han blamed Anakin for Chewbaccas death and returned to the loner he once was, leaving the family to go on adventures with his friend Droma. Leia buried herself in her work with SELCORE, hoping that her husband would one day come back and mend the severed ties with their family.\nA year later, during the Battle of Duro, Leia was captured by Warmaster Tsavong Lah, who tortured her to the brink of paralysis. Lah intended to sacrifice Leia to Yun-Yammka, the God of War and the patron deity of the Warrior caste. Fortunately, Jacen managed to locate his mother and managed to knock Lah out a window, tearing the Warmasters left foot loose. Shortly afterwards Han returned and rescued her.The New Jedi Order: Balance Point'\nAfter Duro was taken by the Yuuzhan Vong, Leia and Han fled to Corellia for Leia to recover. However, they were chased away by Hans cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo, now the Governor-General of the Corellian sector. They then decided to take a short break to try and close the rift in their marriage that was formed by Hans grief over Chewbacca. While on vacation, Leia and Han ran into a previously unknown group of Jedi called the Wild Knights which was lead by Saba Sebatyne, and helped bring them to Lukes attention, and into the limelight of the war.The New Jedi Order: Recovery'\n\n\u2022 Death of a son and aftermath\n\n.]]\nThe New Jedi Order: Dark Journey\nThe Solo family enjoyed small blessings early during the war, beginning with the reconciliation of Han and Anakin, who Han originally had blamed in no small part for Chewbaccas death. Shortly afterwards, Leias nephew Ben Skywalker was born, whom she adored and called \"Skycrawler.\" Other great changes in Leia's life were also taking shape: after having become more and more fed up with the New Republic politics and especially the anti-Jedi sentiment prevailing in the Senate, she eventually made a decision to step out of political life entirely, feeling it was the direction the Force was guiding her to. Even though she had to compromise this decision in some occasions, she largely managed to lead a more low-profile life in the years to come.\nPerhaps the greatest tragedy the Solos would face during the war came shortly afterwards, when on the doomed Mission to Myrkr, Anakin died while leading a Jedi team tasked with the destruction of the Jedi-hunting Yuuzhan Vong creations, the voxyn. To make things worse, her eldest son Jacen was presumed lost as well after the other Jedi of the strike team felt his supposed death through the Force. Leia, however, was convinced that he was still alive, even though everybody else including Han did not really believe her. For a short period of time, Tahiri Veila was put in the care of the Solos after she suffered terrible dreams as a result of her shaping and Anakin's death.\nAlmost concurrently with Anakins death, the Yuuzhan Vong launched a massive attack that overwhelmed Coruscant. Still struggling with the overwhelming grief of her sons death, Leia&mdash;at the urging of Feylya&mdash;managed to make an impassioned plea to all New Republic forces to fight and resist at all costs. Meanwhile, Leia and Han gained temporary custody of their nephew as his parents were busy fighting the war. She enjoyed Bens company but in some ways, she was reminded of her the son she had just lost. During the Fall of Coruscant, Leia was forced to turn Ben over to C-3PO as Viqi Shesh was planning to kidnap the infant. Fortunately, Lando was able to save both Threepio and baby Ben from harms way. After Coruscants fall, Han and Leia went to Hapes for Anakin's funeral.\n\n\u2022 Aiding the war effort\n\nThe New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand'\nAfter the funeral, the Solos journeyed to Borleias, meeting up with Wedge, Luke, and Mara, engaged in a defense of the planet. Leia and Han joined the Insiders, and helped deliver the Myrkr strike team survivors to the Maw. Leia, convinced that Jacen was alive, nevertheless talked Han out of going to Coruscant to look for him, saying she needed him helping her with the Insiders.The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream Returning to Borleias, Leia and Han were then sent on missions to sabotage Yuuzhan Vong activities. On one planet, Leia was forced to abandon a political associate in favor of a more pro-war candidate, and on Aphran IV she and Han were captured by local Peace Brigade-allied forces. Artoo and Threepio sprung them out of prison, and they continued on their way.\nThough they were facing one of the most devastating wars in the galaxy, Leia and Han once again found hope when Jacen was indeed proven to be alive and returned from the Yuuzhan Vong captivity along with his mentor Vergere.The New Jedi Order: Destinys Way Following the reunion with their older son, Leia and Han went on several missions to restore HoloNet communications in the Unknown Regions, and foiled a second attempt of the Ssi-ruuk to invade Bakura in the process.The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee\nWhen Zonama Sekot made its existence known near Coruscant in 29 ABY, Han and Leia traveled there to be reunited with the rest of their family. There they met Harrar, a Yuuzhan Vong priest. Solo also played a major role during the Battle of Yuuzhantar. Leia and Han, along with Harrar, Threepio and Artoo, crashed the Millennium Falcon into the well of the World Brain. After the destruction of Shimrra and Onimi, Leia and the others traveled with Nom Anor across the labyrinth the mighty war vessel of the Master Shaper. However, the executor turned on them, shooting his venom at Han. Jacen managed to save him just in time. Before he could kill them off, Leia engaged Nom Anor, slicing off his hand in the process. They managed to escape and arrived at conclave on Zonama Sekot, which marked the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War.The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force'\nThough the war caused much pain for the Solos and Skywalkers, their relationship became stronger. It was during this time that Leia and Jaina were able to repair their tenuous relationship. She had forsaken politics to become Han's copilot, a position she would hold for five years.\n\n\u2022 The Dark Nest Crisis (35&ndash;36 ABY)\n\nDark Nest Crisis\n\n\u2022 A cry for help\n\nLuke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo\nIn 35 ABY, Han and Leia followed several Jedi including Luke and Mara into the Unknown Regions and discovered that Raynar Thul was alive, and had been taken in by a nest of Killiks. During the mission to Myrkr, Thul had been incapacitated by the Nightsister Lomi Plo and the Dark Jedi Welk. They took him and escaped on the Tachyon Flier, which was under fire during Myrkr outbound, where all three were presumed lost. In truth, the Tachyon Flier had crashed onto the planet Yoggoy, a Killik nest, and made all three Force-users into Joiners. Raynar Thul was integrated into the Yoggoy nest while Lomi Plo and Welk were integrated into the Gorog nest. All became leaders of their respective nests, Raynar even created a new lead nest named Unu and became the Prime Unu, now reborn as UnuThul. The Killik nests took on the persona of the people they integrated, or Joined into their nests. The Yoggoy nests, and each other nest, except for Gorog, gained Raynar's sense of compassion and value for life, whereas the Gorog nest retreated into secrecy, due to the want of Lomi Plo and Welk to hide. The Gorog became the Dark Nest, and secretly controlled the other nests, without their even knowing.\nUnuThul greeted the Solos in Yoggoy hangar with a masterful display of his current Force power. In the Prime Chamber, UnuThul used \"we\" to address himself, stating Raynar Thul no longer existed and \"they\" were now UnuThul. Luke insisted that he sensed Raynar's presence in UnuThul, and guessed Raynar might be in hiding. Raynar then guided the Jedi to read the Chronicle on the wall, explaining the transformation of Raynar Thul to UnuThul, and the rise of the Unu nest. UnuThul explained the Unu nest as \"the nest of the nests.\"\nIn the following interview Luke sensed the Raynar presence rose repeatedly to the surface but was swallowed by the presence of the hive mind. UnuThul claimed that the Crash was remembered, but not the Dark Jedi, and concluded that they must be dead. When Luke tried to probe UnuThul again, the hive mind was able to powerfully push Luke out. When Mara demanded the location of the missing Jedi, UnuThul suddenly Force probed Luke with such a power that required the combined strength of Luke, Mara, Saba and Leia to stop him.\nStill refusing to surrender the location of Qoribu, UnuThul stated that anyone could leave whenever they wanted, and decided to assign a Yoggoy guide to escort the Jedi back to Lizil. The Jedi soon realized that such a collective mind allowed UnuThul to spy on them almost anytime and anywhere on Yoggoy. They visited the crash site, and Leia received Jacen's flow-walking message about Qoribu which was in the Gyuel system. Insects dark blue in color then attempted to assassinate the Jedi Masters at the crash site, which the Jedi barely escaped with Nanna killing several of the blue insects in the process. However, the Yoggoy guide that accompanied the Jedi denied ever seeing any blue insects before its death. When they traveled back to the hangar, Han and UnuThul exchanged harsh words on the matter of attempted assassination. As the debate became a stalemate, Luke proposed that it was another party who attempted to assassinate the Jedi, but UnuThul insisted that even if someone else attacked the Jedi, the hive mind would also be aware. To avoid a war with the Chiss, Leia suggested to UnuThul that the Killik nest be moved to a new planet, but made him think it was his idea.\nAfterwards, Leia decided to formally join the New Jedi Order. Luke and the other Masters initially thought that she meant she was ready to take her place, as in their minds her long history of service to the Force was enough to grant her such a status without question. Instead, Leia insisted that she wanted to earn her place in the order rather than simply be accepted in as the daughter of Anakin and sister of Luke, asking Saba Sebatyne to train her. The Barabel found the idea highly amusing for several seconds, until she realized Leia was completely serious. The former senator, resistance fighter, and head of a galactic government now wanted Saba to challenge her in \"new and unexpected ways.\"\nAlthough skeptical at first, Saba took Leia as her apprentice and treated her more or less as any other Jedi she would train. Which was, in fact, more uncomfortable for the Masters of the Jedi Order than Leia, since more than a few had spent their adult lives taking orders from her and were very close friends. More than once, Saba was forced to remind Leia not to be so familiar with the Masters to the simultaneous amusement and embarrassment of all concerned. However, the results were astonishing as the second child of Anakin Skywalker finally started to reach her true potential in the Force.\n\n\u2022 Swarm War\n\nDark Nest II: The Unseen Queen'\nJust prior to the Swarm War, Luke and Han had been taken prisoner by the Killiks in order to gain help for stopping the Fizz. Upon returning from Ossus with Master Saba, as well as Mara Jade Skywalker and a team of Jedi in StealthXs, Leia was captured by Admiral Nek Bwuatu, commander of the 5th Fleet, stationed in the Utegetu Nebula to prevent the Killiks from leaving their homeworlds. While arguing with the Admiral aboard the Admiral Ackbar, the Killiks attacked the ship. Led by Alema Rar, the Killiks managed to take over the ship, with Leia fighting Rar to a standstill before escaping, just as Han and Luke returned from Utegetu.\nAround this same time, R2-D2 had a malfunction where he had shown Luke a holoclip of the mother he had never known. Before Luke could get more out info out of Artoo, Artoo had a meltdown, claiming he was protecting Luke. Frustrated, Luke contacted master slicer Zakarisz Ghent, who managed to recover one other holo featuring Padm\u00e9 and Anakin Skywalker, which was displayed to both Luke and Leia.\nLeia did not approve when Luke took complete control of the Jedi Order. During the Jedi convocation at Ossus, she and Han discovered that Tenel Ka had recently given birth to a daughter Allana, whom she did not know was her granddaughter through her son Jacen, though she did suspect Jacen knew who the father was. She later went off with Han forsaking the Order to search for their daughter Jaina in the Unknown Regions. They were detained many times, but eventually got to their destination.Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\nOn Tenupe, during the Swarm War, Leia dueled for the third time with Dark Jedi Alema Rar. Saba observed this duel, and was very approving when Leia finally defeated Alema. In truth, the Dark Jedi was dragged off by a huge creature, one that Leia soon knocked off a cliff. The Chiss were less than happy with this explanation and lack of proof of Alema's demise, however.\nLeia then had her lightsaber taken by Saba, who told her that it did not reflect her skills anymore, and that it was time that she build a new lightsaber, one fit for a fully-fledged Jedi Knight. Leia had built her old lightsaber some 20 years before. However, Organa would continue training under Sebatyne for a further four years.Legacy of the Force: Tempest references \"four years of Saba-style training.\"\n\n\u2022 Second Galactic Civil War (40 ABY&ndash;41 ABY)\n\nLegacy of the Force: Bloodlines\n\n\u2022 Rising tensions\n\nIn 40 ABY, when tensions with Corellia rose, Leia remained a member of the Alliance in an official capacity. However, she was secretly aiding the Corellian independence movement. She was present at the Battle of Tralus. Although she was a member of the Alliance fleet, she helped the Corellians to their victory. However, after the battle, Leia did not realize that her son Jacen had turned to the dark side.\nAs the war raged on Leia and Han found themselves banned from Corellia after Thrackan Sal-Solo placed a bounty on the entire Solo family. In order to avoid danger Han and Leia hid on Corellia, splitting up and meeting in Coronet. Getting useful information from Dur Gejjen, Han decided that Thrackan was too dangerous to be left alive and decided that he should die, though he had doubts about killing him in cold blood. While on Corellia, Han and Leia learned of a terrorist attack on a hotel in Coruscant leading to the deaths of thousands. They did not approve when they learned that Jacen and Ben were leading Galactic Alliance Guard raids on the Corellian parts of Coruscant. After hearing the news Leia and Han decided it was time to face their son and left for Coruscant.\nDuring their return to Coruscant, Leia and Jacen performed a Force meld in order to keep the aged ship intact. Soon after, Han, with the help of Boba Fett and Mirta Gev, killed Thrackan, thus ending his reign of terror. Meanwhile, Leia noticed that Jacen has become distant and was slowly becoming a stranger to the whole family. When Leia and Han discovered that Jacen killed Ailyn Vel, Han disowned Jacen while Leia was stricken with shock and betrayal.\n\n\u2022 Allegiance with Corellia\n\nShortly afterwards, Leia, Han, and C-3PO were summoned to the Kiris Asteroid Cluster where the secret Corellian fleet was located. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by Wedge Antilles who was recently bestowed upon the rank of admiral. Han believed that he was summoned to help Antilles defeat the Blockade of Corellia, but he was proven wrong once Dur Gejjen interfered. Instead of leading the attack with Wedge, Han and Leia were tasked with being decoys in order to draw Queen Mother Tenel Ka onto Corellias side.Legacy of the Force: Tempest'\nTraveling to Hapes in order to warn Tenel Ka of danger, Leia and Han learned that Gejjen had been using the Solos to disrupt Tenel Kas security routine and draw her out into the open for an attack. In the process of warning her, Leia and Han unexpectedly walked into an assassination attempt on Tenel Ka by the assassin Nashtah. Due to a series of unfortunate events, the two were forced to work with the assassin in order to escape. The three then set their course for Telkur Station. En route to the station, Leia and Han felt uncomfortable around Nashtah, though they insisted on finding the identity of the coups leader. During their conversation, Nashtah revealed to Leia and Han that shed seen Anakin Skywalker race in the Boonta Eve Classic. It was then that Leia revealed the reason for having children, though Han was upset about revealing such information to a stranger. Leia also stated she would not allow Jacen to become a new Darth Vader after Aurra Sing (Nashtahs true identity) questioned her about Jacen's destiny.\nThey arrived on Telkur Station, only to encounter Jagged Fel, who was presumed lost after the Battle of Tenupe during the Swarm War. During their conversation, Fel revealed that he was marooned on Tenupe for two years after being shot down by Leia. While on Tenupe, he had discovered that Alema Rar was still alive and seeking to kill Leia and her family in revenge for crippling her during their last duel. He also revealed that his family was going through financial troubles, causing him to become a bounty hunter. After the conversation, the three were drugged while Jagged slipped away.\nHan and Leia eventually escaped Sing, only to take another passenger by the name of Lalu Morwan, who was responsible for hiring Sing to assassinate Tenel Ka and her young daughter. Due to Hans injuries he gained during their skirmish on Telkur Station, Leia was forced to fly the Falcon. Jacen ordered the Star Destroyer Anakin Solo to open fire upon the Millennium Falcon. Han and Leia escaped the confrontation, though the Falcon turrets and central core were destroyed by the turbolaser blasts, resulting in the deaths of the Solos trusted Noghri bodyguards Cakhmaim and Meewalh. During the battle, Leias nephew, Ben Skywalker, attempted to arrest Leia and Han for their supposed crimes against the Galactic Alliance. In an attempt to arrest the two, Ben accidentally slashed Zekk in the abdomen, severely injuring him. After making sure that Jaina, Zekk, Ben and his crewman escaped, Leia and Han escaped into hyperspace.\nWith the Falcon in desperate need for repair, Leia and Han traveled to a Tendrando Arms space station at Gyndine, where they reunited with their longtime friend, Lando Calrissian. Leaving Threepio behind to overlook the repairs, the trio left the planet in Landos yacht, the Love Commander. They managed to get through Corellias security zone, partially due to their deceitful disguises and Leias use of a Jedi mind trick.Legacy of the Force: Exile'\n\n\u2022 Breaking from Corellia\n\nMeeting with Denjax Teppler in a Coronet cantina, they discovered that neither Teppler nor Wedge knew of the conspiracy to kill the Queen Mother and that it was the doing of Dur Gejjen. After their conversation, the group was forced to exit the cantina after several CorSec officers tracked Teppler to the cantina. Leia, Han, and Lando parted ways with Denjax shortly thereafter, being chased back to the Love Commander. Only with the intervention of the Pulsar Skate and the Errant Venture were Leia and the others able to defeat Corellian fighters attacking them. Aboard the Errant Venture, Leia reunited with many of her friends and family. They also encountered the smuggler Uran Lavint, who informed them of Alemas existence on the ship and the conference being held on Gilatter VIII. In an attempt to rescue Jacen from a violent ambush, Leia was once again confronted by Alema. The fierce duel that followed ended with a draw, with Alema crashing Lavints ship, the Duracrud, into the Errant Venture.\nUnbeknownst to her and Han, Jacen intended to make them his sacrifice for his ascension to Sith Lord; however, Maras interference led Jacen to choose her as his sacrifice. Leia, along with Han, went to Hapes to comfort Luke and Ben in their grief in the loss of Mara.Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice'\n\n\u2022 Opposing Caedus\n\nLeia and her son, now Darth Caedus\nLeia was scheduled to deliver the eulogy on Coruscant at the Funeral of Mara Jade Skywalker, but a squad of GAG troops intercepted her and Han, despite Lukes guarantee of safe passage. They were forced to fight their way out and flee the Temple before reaching the funeral room, leaving Leias master, Saba Sebatyne to eulogize Mara, as Han and Leia did not want Maras funeral to become a firefight.Legacy of the Force: Inferno'\nInstead, they escaped Coruscant and went to Kashyyyk in an attempt to persuade the Wookiees not to side with the Galactic Alliance. However, GA Intelligence agents Jae Juun and Tarfang caused some interference with their efforts and Leia had to use the Force to seize the stone that gave its wielder the right to address the Wookiee council. About that time, Luke and the other Jedi, having broken with Jacen, arrived on Kashyyyk to assist them. However, Jacen was not far behind and began attacking the planets forests, outraging both Han and Leia. In response, Luke, the newly arrived Jaina, and the other Jedi launched an attack on the Anakin Solo' and its escorting Fifth Fleet in their StealthXs. Han and Leia, meanwhile, took off on the Falcon for the Hapes Cluster to meet with Hapan Queen Mother Tenel Ka.\nUpon arriving at Hapes, through the Force, Leia sensed the disturbance caused by the explosion of Lukes fighter after Jaina, attempting to stop Jacen in his own StealthX from disrupting Lukes attack run, hit Lukes starfighter and destroyed it by accident. Leia was devastated by feeling her twins death, but pulled herself together to face Tenel Ka, which was needed immediately to remove Hapan support from Jacen.\nAs she and Han left the Falcon, they were ambushed by Tahiri Veila, who was one of the few Jedi still loyal to Jacen&mdash;though only because he had manipulated her love for his younger brother Anakin in order to control her and use her as a spy. Leia and Tahiri fought viciously in the Hapan Royal Hangar, with Leia gaining the upper hand. It is likely that Leia would have killed Tahiri had Han not stopped her and Queen Mother Tenel Ka arrived. Tenel Ka sent Tahiri away for ambushing the Solos, giving her a \"Royal Guard Escort\" out of the Hapan system. Leia and Han were successful in persuading Tenel Ka to withdraw Hapan support of Jacen.\nLater, Leia was in on a meeting between the Jedi, the Bothans and Confederate forces. She and Han had no opposition to the Bothan's statement that they were going to send assassins after Jacen, for they had realized earlier that their son was already dead - that this evil and wicked Jacen was not the one they had known all their lives. Leia could no longer feel \"Jacen\", or the boy that she had known as Jacen, in the Force; he had not been ripped away as Anakin had been, but a gradual disappearance that she had not noticed until he was gone.\nLeia later attempted to plead with Jacen on renouncing the dark side, but he simply shut her out, refusing. In reality, Leia had not expected her pleas to work, she was merely distracting Jacen to provide time for Jaina, Han, Zekk and Jag to hack into the computers upon the Anakin Solo. Later, Han and Leia used the knowledge obtained here to help rescue the Hapan Princess Allana, whom Jacen was hiding in secret quarters. While Luke, Ben, and Saba distracted Jacen by make a charge for the bridge, Han, Leia, and Iella Wessiri Antilles crawled through air vents to reach the young princess. After Allana was rescued, Han and Leia discovered that Allana was their granddaughter.\nAfter returning Allana to her mother on Hapes, Han and Leia traveled back to the Jedi outpost on Endor. Leia and her daughter Jaina met with Ben Skywalker to discuss his belief that Jacen had murdered his mother. He promised them that he would seek evidence to prove or disprove that Jacen killed Mara. Later Leia and Han were present on Endor when Ben received a recording from Lon Shevu that showed Jacen admitting to the murder, and revealing his new name of Darth Caedus.Legacy of the Force: Revelation\nA short time later, the Jedi abandoned the base for an undisclosed world near the Transitory Mists. Leia and Han accompanied the Jedi, and were pleased that the location of the new base would give them additional opportunities to see their granddaughter. When the recording of Jacen confessing to be both the Sith Lord Darth Caedus and Mara Jade's killer was shown, Leia burst into tears and hugged Ben.\nFollowing Jainas training under Boba Fett, she revealed to Han and Leia that she had to be the one to kill Jacen, now known as Darth Caedus. Jaina and her mother followed Ben discreetly to Monument Plaza while he met with one of his local contacts, Lon Shevu, a captain in the Galactic Alliance Guard. However, Shevu had been followed by Caeduss agents, including his apprentice Tahiri Veila. After Shevu was captured, Ben escaped away from the two Solos, trying to keep them from being discovered. Leia and Jaina attempted pursuit anyway after Veila captured Ben, but they were forced to break off the chase after Veila starting leading them into an obvious trap where they would be captured as well. Heart-stricken, they made their way back to their ship and returned to Shedu Maad to inform Luke Skywalker that they had lost his son. As they broke the news to him, Skywalker informed them that he had already foreseen that possible future and allowed it to happen anyway, for the sake of bringing down Caedus.Legacy of the Force: Invincible\nJaina embarked on a mission, dueling Caedus first on Nickel One, and then encountering him on the Anakin Solo. After a duel and being mortally wounded, Caedus stopped fighting so he could warn Tenel Ka about a threat to Allana. Jaina thought this to be a trick and killed him, horrified when she felt Jacen reaching out to Tenel Ka. Jaina then sat on the floor holding Caeduss head in her lap as Jagged Fel and her parents came to her aid. Han and Leia tried to avoid looking at their sons body but quickly broke into tears. Jaina would later say that she thought Caedus reaching out to Tenel Ka meant that he became Jacen before his death, and that she felt Jacen die through her twin bond, not Caedus.\nThough the Solos struggled to get through this hard time, they were able to remember Jacen as the kind young man he had once been, not the Sith he had turned into. The war had ended. Additional comfort and joy came from her granddaughter, Allana, whom Tenel Ka had given to Han and Leia to raise under the pseudonym Amelia because she knew that they could give the girl a safer life than she could on Hapes. Allana began training at the Jedi academy, though she ultimately left the academy to reside permanently with her grandparents.\n\n\u2022 Picking up the pieces (43 ABY&ndash;)\n\n\u2022 Sojourn\n\nAt the conclusion of the war between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation, Natasi Daala was elected as the new Galactic Alliance Chief of State, and relations between the government and the Jedi Order proved tense. After Allana, still in the care of her grandparents and living under the alias of Amelia, discovered a strange object resembling an antiquated transponder aboard the Millennium Falcon, the Solos decided to track down the previous owners of the ship in the hopes of learning about it; as well as using the time as a means of escaping the tension of Coruscant. By this time, Leia had been planning on writing a multi-volume memoir of her life and the plan to seek out the Millennium Falcon origins inspired her to call the second volume The Crook, The Wook, and Me.Millennium Falcon'\nHaving visited Lando, the Solos learned that the transponder remained active and appeared to have been installed sometime during the Clone Wars. In addition, Lando alerted Leia to an encounter he had with Jedi Knight Seff Hellin on the planet of Taris, during which Hellin tried to commission a force of Mandalorian Hunter Droids for himself, as a means of combating Chief of State Daala's Mandalorian security forces. Unnerved by this, the Solos headed to Taris and encountered the rogue Jedi Knight themselves.\nAllana immediately noticed similarities between the way Jacen and Seff felt in the Force. Indeed, Seff interfered with an important Alliance operation, leading to a warrant for his arrest. However, using powers akin to those Jacen had been known to use, the rogue Jedi was able to escape his captors. Fearing the implications of this, Leia immediately contacted Luke, who also believed there to be a connection between Seff and Jacen. In addition, Seff's actions led to further discord between the Jedi and Chief Daala, who feared that Jacen had set a trend for younger Jedi turning to the dark side, forcing Luke to recall all Jedi to the Temple.\nThe Solos ultimately followed the transponder and the information provided by the Falcon previous owners to a hidden Old Republic \"Insignia of Unity\" which had once adorned the Senate Building, though it proved to be nothing more than a simulacrum. En route back to Coruscant, Leia received a communication revealing that Luke had been arrested by Chief Daala for \"dereliction of duty\" and as such the Solos rushed to his aid.\n\n\u2022 Mission to Kessel\n\nLuke ultimately gained his freedom by exiling himself from the Jedi Order and subsequently began a quest to learn what had lead to Jacens fall to the dark side. In Lukes absence, Kenth Hamner was appointed Grand Master. Further complicating relations between the Order and the government, Jedi Knight Valin Horn began to exhibit similar behavior to Seff Hellin. Indeed, along with displaying a power possessed only by Jacen, Jedi Horn was adamant that every single person in his life had been replaced by a double. Both Leia and Han participated in the capture of the deranged Jedi, though it was Luke who ultimately stopped him.Fate of the Jedi: Outcast\nThe Solos were soon contacted by Lando and were forced to aid him in saving the planet of Kessel which had succumbed to violent earthquakes at the time Centerpoint Station was destroyed. Leia was instrumental throughout this, as her ability to use the Force proved an advantage. The Solos discovered a strange species of pure energy based beings living within Kessel, who monitored every gravity well in the galaxy, and who had begun to leave en masse; causing the earthquakes that wreaked across Kessel. Ultimately, however, the Solos and their allies proved able to save Kessel from destruction.\nLater, the Solos were summoned back to Coruscant by the Council in the aftermath of Jysella Horn succumbing to the same psychosis as a her older brother and Seff Hellin. It had become obvious that this mental illness was not an isolated event, and Cilghal wished to discuss the behavior Seff Hellin had displayed during his earlier encounter with the Solos, lest it be important. Darkmeld had secretly captured the rogue Jedi, and Cilghal was carrying out tests in the hopes of finding a cure for the mysterious illness.\n\n\u2022 Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition\n\nAfter returning to Coruscant, Leia convinced Han that they should attend the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition for a day, so as to provide an outing for Allana not fraught with danger, and to surprise her by purchasing a member of the animal species she gravitated towards most as a pet. It took several days for arrangements to be made for the Solo family to attend the event. Jaina accompanied her mother, father and niece to the event, while Jedi Knights Natua Wan and Radd Minker escorted them. Originally, Han and Leia had hoped that Jedi Knights Bazel \"Barv\" Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu would be able to accept the assignment to escort them, as Allana was particularly fond of them, however, they were off world at the time.\nThe small group first observed the animals in the outdoors exhibits, before moving on to the Small Animal Hall. In addition, the group made an effort to avoid journalist Javis Tyrr, who had consistently attacked the behavior of the Jedi on his Holoshow and had taken a particular interest in the activities of Jaina. It seemed the group was successful after entering the Dangerous Animal area at the insistence of Allana. Unfortunately, Javis Tyrr proved to be among the least of the group's worries.\nIn the excitement, the Solos and Jedi Minker had failed to notice the disappearance of the Falleen Jedi Natua Wan. However, Leia, Jaina and Radd Minker soon sensed a sudden disturbance in the Force, and after turning to find Natua missing, Leia immediately realized that she to had succumbed to the illness that plagued Seff Hellin, Valin and Jysella Horn. Wan proceeded to release the dangerous animals from their cages and retract the bridges leading to emergency exits, in the hopes of killing everyone inside; as, overcome by the mystery illness, she believed them to be \"impostors.\" In the ensuing chaos, Leia was forced to demonstrate her prowess as a Jedi by killing five boar-wolves to save a young child and a mother nexu who had injured an Ithorian spectator.\nAfter this, Wan proceeded to taunt Leia, who made her way to the control room expecting to confront her. However, despite Wans voice emanating from there, she was nowhere to be found. Leia soon found Wan confronting Jaina, and aided her daughter in a brief lightsaber duel with the Falleen, before Jedi Minker head-butted the deranged Jedi, rendering her unconscious. Leia noted that Wan had demonstrated the ability to throw her voice using the Force, a strange ability her late son Jacen had also been known to possess. Wans rampage proved particularly disastrous, as Javis Tyrr had managed to capture a large amount of the chaos on film and aided in souring the deteriorating relationship between the Jedi Order and the government of Chief Daala.\nLeia was intimately involved in negotiations with Daala after Wans rampage, and Javis Tyrrs discovery that the Jedi had secretly captured Seff Hellin; which he proceeded to make public. These negotiations resulted in the Jedi being able to retain custody of Wan and Hellin, though Daalas people would have to be allowed access to them at all hours. In addition, Leia, Jaina acting Grand Master Kenth Hamner, Cilghal, and Tekli were forced to publicly apologize for being involved, or failing to prevent, the Jedis deception.\nDuring this time, Kenth Hamner noted that Leia was expected to soon rise to the rank of Jedi Master. She may have become one at some point following this.\n\n\u2022 Another fall\n\nFate of the Jedi: Abyss\nSometime after Leia and Han went to see Hellin. As they were talking, the Knight attacked Leia, but was subdued only after Cilghal subdued him with their stun stick. An hour or so afterward she helped subdue Jedi Knight Bazel Warv and Jedi Knight Yaqeel Saav'etu. Right after that, GAS found out about it and served a warrant automatically.\nLeia was the negotiator of course and decided that the GAS squad needed a little help understanding. Jaina and Jag were also there and had decided to step out. Leia then performed, as Jaina later referred to in Jag's limo, a Sligh Slipper and closed the door to the Temple, preventing GAS from getting in. When they went back inside the Temple, they found Barv having convulsions. Jedi Apprentice Melari Ruxon, whom Han had told to fire another dart at the patients if they so much as twitched, had fired two darts at him.\nLeia had to calm the apprentice and her partner about the disease that was claiming their Knights, saying that everything was going to be alright and that Master Cilghal would figure this out. Master Hamner then came in demanding what had happened outside. Han was sent to find something to help transport Barv after he had interrupted their \"discussion.\" Hamner then demanded why she ignored a warrant saying that he would have preferred the two Knights in carbonite \"if that was what the law demanded.\" Leia reminded him that the law was not justice and that they could not turn over the Knights because they were and especially when Daala's solution is to turn them into carbonite.\nShe was saved by the bell when Master Cilghal came in, saying she had good news. However, as usual, her first priority was her patients and she had asked them to help move them. Master Hamner said he had strong objections, telling her that there was a warrant out for them. She asked the Solos how many they had hurt, learning that they had not hurt anyone. Cilghal then asked why they had a warrant out for them and Leia told her that the government considered them a \"public endangerment\" and saying that it was an overstatement telling her that they had had the Knights inside the Temple in two minutes flat. Master Hamner argued that since they had served a warrant, the Jedi are required to submit to it. Cilghal immediately took the Solos' side saying Daala was not going to freeze her patients to score points with public relations, and that if Master Hamner was that desperate, he was going to have to call the Council into it and take a vote.\nLeia had begun levitating Barv (with difficulty) when Apprentices, Swen and Reeqo's robes were found. At first Hamner had panicked, but Cilghal said that they had not caught the disease because they were too young. She then revealed that only the children who were in the Maw during the Yuuzhan Vong war were at risk, and that the adults were probably in the clear since none of them had fallen ill.\n\n\u2022 Personality and traits\n\nWilhuff Tarkin\nIn her youth Leia had a fiery attitude and was headstrong, though not as much as her brother and father. As a child, Leia was not fond of her role as the Princess of Alderaan. She was often seen by many, especially her family, as a tomboy and was sometimes mistaken for a domestic girl rather than a princess. As she matured her outspoken nature blossomed and her dislike of her title ceased. Leia also had a strong personality and a bright intellect. Unlike her brother, Luke Skywalker, and her father, Anakin, Leia never looked for adventure or rushed into things without thinking. Like her mother, Leia avoided the corruption of politics, and instead concentrated on helping others.\nDespite growing up on the peaceful world of Alderaan, Leia never became soft. Throughout the Galactic Civil War, Leia proved to be the leader that everyone was willing to follow. Her fierceness and determination to restore freedom to the galaxy helped the Rebel Alliance get through even the toughest of battles. Leia had always put duty before her own personal needs, making her the perfect leader for the New Republic. However, this would be a burden as she had to be away from her young children. Over time her strong stance on political matters ceased and by the time of the Black Fleet Crisis many were seeking to oust Solo from her position as Chief of State.\nLeia was known for having compassion for her friends, and would go to great lengths to help them, whenever she could. This was why she had a strong bond with her son, Jacen, who shared her view. Unfortunately, this bond was shattered after Jacen fell to the dark side.\n\n\u2022 Powers and abilities\n\nYoung Jedi Knights: Shards of Alderaan'\nThough Leia would originally follow in her mother's footsteps, becoming a shrewd politician, she possessed many other talents. Indeed, Leia would eventually follow the path of her father and brother, becoming a Jedi of considerable skill; both with the Force and a lightsaber.\n\n\u2022 Jedi training\n\nBy the time of Operation Shadow Hand, Leia was \"above all things\" a Jedi warrior.Dark Empire 1\nA short time after having learned of her Force-sensitivity in 4 ABY, Leia was able to use the Force to sense her brothers presence, confirming he had survived the destruction of the second Death Star. During the Swarm War, Leia was able to use her much increased connection to the Force, having become the student of Master Sebatyne, to sense the whereabouts of Alema Rar by distinguishing between the powerful Living Force presences on the planet Tenupe, which contrasted sharply with Alemas hidden presence.\nIn 10 ABY, Leia helped her brother defeat Palpatine through the use of her natural talent with battle meditation; at this time Leia had little Force training and her ability to use such a powerful Force power is indicative of her strength in the Force.\nStill untrained, Leia was able to shield her infant son Anakin, from Palpatines disembodied spirit, preventing the Sith Lord from possessing the child.\nLeia was skilled in the use of telekinetic powers such as Force Push, Force Pull and Saber throw, as well as in using the Force to plant herself firmly in place. Leia exhibited a talent for telekinetically controlling the air paths taken by fog, being able to manipulate it at great speeds, allowing the Millennium Falcon to race through it without losing visibility prior to the onset of the Dark Nest crisis. In 40 ABY, Leia was able to telekinetically hold the Millennium Falcon together against the pressure caused as it crashed through the atmosphere of Coruscant. However, it took the combined might of Leia, Jaina and Jacen to ultimately land the severely damaged ship with the Force.\nAlthough strong in telekinesis, Leia was not very good with levitation. In 43.5 ABY, she strained in moving Jedi Knight Warv and could not divide her attention to Han when he said that two apprentices had left their robes behind.\nBefore she had any proper training, Leias earliest displays with a lightsaber showed promise. She had been able to wound her own father, Darth Vader, before being quickly defeated on Mimban. After training under Master Sebatyne, Leias skills became formidable, allowing her to hold her own against, and severely injure, the much younger Alema Rar on several occasions. Even before her official training, Leia proved capable of defeating the centuries-old and fully trained Dark Jedi Beldorion in a fierce lightsaber duel. Despite her grief over the supposed death of her brother, Leia proved capable of dueling Tahiri Veila; indeed, it was the intervention of Han Solo alone that made Leia spare the aspiring Sith apprentices life.\nLike the other Jedi of her family, Leia demonstrated a talent for participating in Force Melds. Notably Leia participated in a battle meld with her daughter, Master and Zekk during the Battle of Tenupe.\nLeia was capable of telepathic feats; being able to communicate through the Force with her brother at a seemingly limitless range. Leia also demonstrated an ability to reach out to others in the Force to read their feelings or emotions. In her interrogation during the Swarm War, Leia was able to telepathically read the mind of her interrogator so as to learn his name and unnerve him.\nDuring her third duel with Alema Rar, Leia was temporarily able to fool Alema into relinquishing her weapon; an exceptional achievement against a fully trained Jedi Knight. Leia proved able to use Jedi mind tricks on troopers who attempted to arrest her during the funeral of her sister-in-law.\nLeia also showed a talent in Force-flashing electronical devices. In 44 ABY, Leia and Han went to visit Tahiri Veila in her cell, as her trial had just begun. The guards there however would not let Leia and Han speak to Tahiri alone, the most they got was speaking to Tahiri alone in her cell, as the camera was recording their conversations. Leia Force-flashed it so all three of them could talk in privacy without being overheard by anyone.\nIn 45 ABY, while within the Hidden Monolith, Leia became one with the dark side of the Force (though she was not tainted by this experience) and then the light side of the Force. In this latter state, she made a shell of golden Force lightning and finally disintegrated the Qreph brothers with Golden flash.Crucible\n\n\u2022 Other abilities\n\nDuring her first term as senator, she was taught self-defense and combat skills by Giles Durane, a weapons master and friend of Bail Organa. Leia was an excellent marksman, missing rarely, if ever, with a blaster.Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary She also proven to be a good sniper, managing to use an E-11 blaster rifle to shoot Vader in the back from a great distance in a cave.\nLeia was also an able starfighter pilot. She was known to fly an Y-wing fighter on a number of missions for the Alliance.Star Wars (1977) 65Star Wars' (1977) 68\nLeia was a skilled tactician who was involved in the planning of several important engagements during the various galactic conflicts of her time.\nAs of 2 ABY, Leia Organa admitted she did not know how to swim.\n\n\u2022 Equipment\n\nLeia primary used a Defender sporting blaster pistol and a smaller more compact version of the Defender called X-30 \"Lancer\" target blast pistol.\nAfter discovering she was Force-sensitive, Leia Organa Solo utilized several lightsabers through her career as a Jedi of the New Jedi Order. Her first lightsaber was created by herself while she was taught under her twin brother, Luke Skywalker. During the Thrawn campaign in 9 ABY, it was used by Mara Jade to kill both Luuke Skywalker and Joruus Cbaoth. This lightsaber had a blue bladeThe Last Command. The color briefly became pale blue when she dueled and killed the fallen Hutt Jedi Beldorion with it on Nam ChoriosPlanet of Twilight. In 18 ABY, Luke gifted her a second lightsaber that had a ruby-red blade that he built from scratch. The lightsaber is described as smaller than her previous one. Leia briefly used a 10,000 year old lightsaber that she got from an old Jedi named Vima-Da-Boda. On Byss, Leia used it to slice the hand off of an Imperial Sentinel, before Palpatine caused it to explode.Star Wars: Dark Empire While training under Saba Sebatyne, Leias lightsabers were taken by her new Jedi Master, who told her that they did not reflect her skills anymore, and that it was time that she build a new lightsaber, one fit for a fully-fledged Jedi Knight. Leia had built a new blue-bladed lightsaber that she used throughout the Swarm War and thereafter.Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\n\n\u2022 Romances\n\nHan Solo and Leia Organa\n\n\u2022 Raal Panteer\n\nRaal Panteer was a childhood friend of Leia's, who, even after the destruction of their homeworld, seemed to be interested in a relationship with the Princess. His death ended any such possibility, however. Though, when the two were younger, they shared their first kiss in the reflection pools on Alderaan at night.\n\n\u2022 Luke Skywalker\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Leia was one third of a love triangle as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo both harbored feelings for her. She seemed to have shared these feelings for both men to some respect. However, after Luke and Leia discovered they were siblings, their relationship evolved into that of brother and sister, and Leia's love for Solo was realized.\n\n\u2022 Fenn Shysa\n\nWhen Han was frozen in carbonite, Leia spent most of her time looking for his whereabouts. During her search she came across Mandalore Fenn Shysa, who had planned to capture her as he thought that Leia was her deceased mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Leia used her charms on Shysa, distracting him with a passionate kiss. Eventually Shysa joined Organa in her search for Han and as a result the two developed a relationship. However, the relationship did not last.\n\n\u2022 Prince Denid\n\nDuring a mission to the planet Velmor, Leia had a brief relationship with the planets pro-Alliance ruler, Prince Denid, and masqueraded as his betrothed, Lady Loren of Alderaan. Denid hoped to marry Leia and silenced her objections with a kiss before they spent the night together. Leia gave him a parting kiss upon leaving the planet. Nothing came out of it, however, and it was apparently discontinued after the completion of the mission.Star Wars' (1977) 49\n\n\u2022 Prince Xizor\n\nThen there was Prince Xizor, who was the leader of the Black Sun criminal organization. However, this relationship was one of seduction and not love. Xizor was a member of the Falleen species, who were known for their special ability to attract members of the opposite sex by using their pheromones, which he used to his advantage by seducing Organa. The relationship was short-lived though, as Leia was able to overcome his seduction and delivered an embarrassing kick to Xizor's groin.\n\n\u2022 Trioculus\n\nDuring his campaign against the New Republic, Trioculus became infatuated with Leia Organa. Though the feeling was not mutual, Trioculus believed he could convince her to betray the New Republic and turn to the dark side of the Force. His attempts to do so included telling her to accept her own darker aspects, and explaining that evil acts and murder were sometimes necessary, and did not diminish his own capacity to love.\nTrioculuss obsession with Leia would ultimately lead to his downfall: first when he tried to kill Zorba the Hutt for wanting her dead, which led to his capture and the rise of Kadann, and finally when he married Project Decoys human replica droid, believing it to be Leia, which killed him.\n\n\u2022 Prince Isolder\n\nIn 8 ABY Prince Isolder of Hapes asked for Leia's hand in matrimony. At a formal reception he presented many gifts which Leia accepted, nearly saying yes to his proposal. However, Han intervened and during a trip to Dathomir Isolder fell in love with the Dathomiri witch Teneniel Djo.\n\n\u2022 Han Solo\n\nLeia Organa and Han Solo\nWhen they first met, the two got off to a rocky start; however, as they worked together during the Galactic Civil War, Leia and Han Solo developed a relationship that would last throughout the war. Though Leia did not admit at first, she had feelings for Han, but she also had feelings for Luke. However, when Han became frozen in carbonite, Leia realized that she loved him.\nIn 8 ABY, the two were married and had three children, Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo, in the next two years. Even with the death of their youngest child Anakin and the fall of Jacen to the dark side, their relationship grew stronger. Not even the war would tear them apart.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nLeia Organa Solo appeared in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope; the novel depicted her slightly before the films release in 1977. She would go on to be born in the conclusion of the prequel trilogy, in 2005. However, that her brother, Luke, and she would be born in the prequels was announced in 1998. The original trilogy was rereleased in theaters and VHS to commemorate the twenty year anniversary of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope' the year before and Star Wars Trivial Pursuit was released to coincide with this. The limited edition game, released in 1998, contained a sequestered pack of questions that served as a preview of the first new trilogy installment, one of which divulged this.\n\n\u2022 Portrayal\n\nLeia was played most notably by actress Carrie Fisher in the original trilogy and The Star Wars Holiday Special. All subsequent images of her likeness were based on Fishers appearance. She was also played by Aidan Barton (the son of editor Roger Barton) as an infant in Revenge of the Sith'.\nBoth Databank at StarWars.com and The New Essential Guide to Characters list Leia Organa Solo's official height as 1.5 meters.\nLeia has been also been portrayed vocally by Ann Sachs in the Star Wars radio dramas, Lisa Fuson in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, Star Wars: Masters of Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si and Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, Susanne Egli in the audio adaptations of Rebel Agent and Jedi Knight from the Dark Forces novella, Grey DeLisle in Star Wars: Force Commander, Joyce Kurtz in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, Star Wars: Battlefront II and Star Wars: Lethal Alliance, Catherine Taber in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, and Clare Grant in Star Wars: Smuggler's Gambit.\nCarrie Fisher also made an appearance as Leia on the November 18, 1978 episode of Saturday Night Live (which aired one day after the holiday special), which she also hosted as herself.Star Wars Insider 97 The July 1983 issue of Rolling Stone magazine parodied this appearance. In Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, Julie Dolan supplied the voice of Leia, while the image supplied for her hologram transmission was a modified version of unused footage from her plea to Obi-Wan Kenobi in A New Hope.\n\n\u2022 Character development\n\nIn the rough draft of A New Hope, Leia was a 14-year-old princess (the same age as Queen Amidala in The Phantom Menace), the spoiled daughter of King Kayos and Queen Breha of Aquilae. In that draft, she had two brothers, Biggs and Windy, whose identities were substantially revised into their current form by the fourth draft (though they did not appear in intervening versions). The third draft established her as Leia Organa, Princess of the peaceful world of Organa Major. In the fourth draft, Organa Major was renamed Alderaan and the Revised Fourth Draft gave Leias father the name Bail Antilles.The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film' Interestingly, when George Lucas was writing background material for licensees in 1977, he wrote that she had several brothers, and that she was unaware whether her parents had escaped the destruction of her homeworld. No-one from the House of Organa, however, had reached the Rebels as yet.\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, Luke and Leia were not supposed to be siblings originally; Lukes sister was originally going to be a different person over on the other side of the galaxy, who was going to show up in a later episode that never came to be. Leia being Lukes sister was added to 6 \"to wrap up everything neatly\".\n\n\u2022 Name\n\n\u2022 The name \"Leia\" has a number of potential origins. It may have been derived from \"Laya\" which in Arabic means \"weary\". Alternatively it might mean \"mistress\" or \"ruler\" in Assyrian. Additionally, a Talmudic source cites \"Leila\" as the \"Angel of Night\". A third origin could be the Greek word \"basileia,\" meaning \"reign\". There was also a biblical character called \"Leah\" (which is pronounced as Leia) in the book of Genesis, she was Jacob's first wife.\n\n\u2022 In the Italian version of the films, \"Leia Organa\" was renamed to \"Leila Organa\".\n\n\u2022 In June 2005, Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway admitted in an interview that the first name of her youngest daughter, Leah Isadora Behn, was inspired by Princess Leia.\n\n\u2022 Costumes\n\nThe costume designer for the films had a \"no lingerie in space\" policy, which prevented Fisher from wearing a brassiere. To maintain decorum, adhesive tape was used in place of the banned garment.\n\n\u2022 The \"doughnut hairstyle\"\n\nThe packaging and instruction book for Kenners 1978 12-inch Princess Leia figure referred to the hairdo in A New Hope as \"Star Puffs.\" Miss Piggy of Jim Hensons Muppet Babies once copied said hairdo using doughnuts in a Star Wars-centric episode of the series. Also, in one scene from Mel Brooks Spaceballs, Princess Vespa also appears to have the hairstyle, but reveals that she is actually merely wearing a large pair of headphones. In addition, in the parody film Thumb Wars, the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who, as the name implies, had two cinnamon rolls for hair. Finally, preceding all the other parodies, the short film Hardware Wars shows Chewchilla, the Wookiee Monster actually eating one of Princess Ann-Droids cinnamon buns.\nIn reality, however, Leias hairdo may not be as unique as it first appears. Young marriageable Hopi Indian women traditionally wore a very elaborate \"squash blossom\" hairdo that superficially resembles Princess Leias.The \"squash blossom\" hairstyleWaukegan Historical Society.org - \"The Hopi\" George Lucas commented on the hairstyle in Time magazine: \"In the 1977 film, I was working very hard to create something different that wasnt fashion, so I went with a kind of Southwestern Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look, which is what that is. The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century Mexico,\" indicating that the hairstyle originated from the Soldaderas during the Mexican Revolution. In 2017, the traveling Smithsonian exhibition \"Star Wars and the Power of Costume\" included a photo of Mexican revolutionary colonel Clara de la Rocha as one of the inspirations for the style, alongside photos of Hopi women with the \"squash blossom\" hairstyle.\nIn Europe, a similar hairstyle still persists in the Spanish region of Valencia, and can be seen during the Falles festival.\nLeias signature hairdo also inspired a recurring freshman gag at the U.S. Naval Academy. Along with \"wildmans\" and \"assassinations,\" the \"Princess Leia\" is another popular method for freshmen (Plebes) to taunt their superiors. The freshman smears peanut butter on a pair of hamburger bun halves or English muffin halves, sneaks up behind an upperclassman in the dining hall, and sticks them on the upperclassmans ears. These dining hall pranks, however, have been discouraged in recent years.Academy Cancels Herndon\n\n\u2022 Leia as a cultural figure\n\nOwing to the characters positive reception and the cultural legacy of Star Wars, Leia has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films, and celebrated in cosplay. with Fisher also appearing in Leias bikini costume on the cover of the Summer 1983 issue of Rolling Stone, and a painting of Leia and other characters surrounding Lucas appeared on the cover of the May 25, 1983 issue of Time announcing Return of the Jedi. Princess Leia also appeared on a 2007 US postage stamp and a 2015 UK stamp.\n\n\u2022 Her biological mother\n\nStar Wars: The Annotated Screenplays'\nGeorge Lucas stated that he wanted one of the Skywalker twins to recall their mother, hence Leia describing her as \"very beautiful, kind but sad\" in Return of the Jedi.\nWhen Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith came out, many people did not understand how it was possible that Leia claims to remember her mother although she had known her for barely a minute. There has been some debate about whether Leia is discussing her biological mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, or her foster mother Breha Organa. However, the official Star Wars website explicitly states in its \"Q & A\" section that Leia is remembering Padm\u00e9.\n\n\u2022 Princess Leia's Theme\n\nPrincess Leia's Theme is the musical leitmotif in the Star Wars saga that represents Princess Leia Organa.\nIt is first heard in A New Hope, when Princess Leia is captured by Darth Vader. Later, it is heard as R2-D2 plays Leias holographic message to Obi-Wan Kenobi. It is also heard very fully as Leia nostalgically remembers the innocent past. The theme plays when Obi-Wan Kenobi is killed by Darth Vader, even though Leia has no direct involvement in this event. This was written in the soundtrack notes for A New Hope. Finally, it plays in the end credits of A New Hope'.\nIn The Empire Strikes Back the theme is again present and is also developed in the new theme Han Solo and the Princess, which acted as the films love theme. Princess Leias Theme plays as Han Solo tells Leia that he must leave to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. The only other time it plays is at the end of the movie, when Leia and Lando Calrissian rescue Luke Skywalker from Cloud City on Bespin. During this film, Leias theme is replaced by the love theme mainly as a representation of Han and Leia being a couple. However, once Han is taken by Boba Fett, Leias theme returns to signify again, she is alone.\nIn Return of the Jedi, the theme is only heard as Leia shoots a stormtrooper on the moon Endor.\nThe theme was revived for the \"prequel\" trilogy. Its first occurrence in a sequential viewing of the six-film Star Wars saga is in Revenge of the Sith, when her adoptive parents, Bail Organa and his wife, hold the newborn Leia during the final montage of shots at the end of the film. It reappears soon after during the end credits of the movie. This was to uplift the depressing mood of the movie and remind people that there was hope.\n\n\u2022 Alternate endings\n\n\u2022 Senator Leia Organa, Sith apprentice\n\nStar Wars Infinities: A New Hope 3]]\nIn the graphic novel, Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope, the Rebel Alliance is defeated and Princess Leia finds herself a captive of the Emperor. Darth Vader begins training her in the ways of the Sith, helping her to develop her Force powers, in the hopes that one day they will overthrow the Emperor and rule the galaxy together. Additionally, she becomes the senator representing Coruscant in the reformed Imperial Senate. Leia takes her training from Darth Vader seriously and in the final climactic battle with Luke, she uses her father's Sith lightsaber to attack him. Luke manages to turn Leia back to the light side and escapes Coruscant prior to its destruction. Years later, Leia becomes the Chancellor of the New Republic, leading the galaxy into a time of peace and prosperity.\n\n\u2022 Leia Organa, Jedi Apprentice\n\nStar Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back 4]]\nIn the graphic novel, Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back, Luke froze to death on Hoth when Hans Tauntaun failed to reach him in time, his final words being about Dagobah and getting trained by Yoda. Misinterpreting Lukes words as being a wish for Han to train as a Jedi, Leia and the others travel to the planet, where they encounter Yoda. The Jedi Master explains that Leia is the one who has to be trained as a Jedi, and also reveals her family connection to Luke and Darth Vader. Leia agrees to be trained by Yoda, while Han reluctantly leaves to deal with his deathmark. Over the course of many months, Leia makes fast progress with her training and grows strong in the force. During the last stages of Leias training, in which she assembles her own lightsaber, Darth Vader appears and mortally wounds Yoda. Leia and Vader then duel with their lightsabers, during which Leia manages to sever Vaders arm, before the Sith Lord is finally blasted and killed by Han and Chewbacca. Before Yoda dies, he encourages Leia to pass what she has learned on to others. Leia then burns her father's body in a funeral pyre. Now a Jedi Knight, Leia returns to the Millennium Falcon to resume the battle to defeat the Empire and bring peace to the galaxy.\n\n\u2022 Leia Organa, Jedi Knight\n\nLeia Organa, to the Dark Apprentice\nIn the Endor downloadable level for Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, Leia is once again involved with the mission to Endor to destroy the shield generator protecting the second Death Star. Vader sends the Dark Apprentice, a clone of Galen Marek, to eliminate the Rebels and protect the shield generator. After killing Han and Chewbacca, the Dark Apprentice proceeds into the shield generator to find Leia. To his surprise, Organa removes her Rebel gear to reveal her Jedi robes and brandishes a yellow-bladed lightsaber, constructed in the same shape of Obi-Wan Kenobis. Leia reveals that Luke died during the Battle of Hoth, and that she took up his destiny of becoming a Jedi Knight. The two clash furiously in the generator room, however, the Apprentice was more skilled than Leia. The fight continued outside, where the Dark Apprentice managed to overpower and kill Leia, thus ending the mission to destroy the shield generator.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\nLEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 film]]\n\u2022 \"An Apology\"\n\n\u2022 Escape from the Jedi Temple\n\n\u2022 Race for the Holocrons\n\n\u2022 Raid on Coruscant\n\n\u2022 Clash of the Skywalkers\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nBreha Organa]]\nNew Republic Senate]])\nImperial Senate]]\nCarlist Rieekan]]\n21 ABY]]\n27 ABY]]\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Princess Leia Organa\n\n\u2022 Leia",

Subsequently, he was Senator of the Alderaan sector of the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]] from 19 BBY to [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]].

While he always had all the material things he needed, Organa's parents were careful never to spoil him.<ref name=\"Wild Space\" /> As a youth, Bail Organa was trained to eventually take up Alderaan's [[Alderaanian delegation/Legends|seat]] in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]]. Despite the rampant corruption that had spread its tentacles to most of the [[Politics/Legends|political]] class, the actions of civic-minded statesmen such as [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum/Legends|Finis Valorum]] finally convinced Organa that he could do well in the Senate.\n\n[[File:Bail_Organa_Coruscant_background.png|thumb|left|200px|Bail Organa, Viceroy and Senator]]\nDespite his pampered upbringing, Organa maintained many personal acquaintances across Alderaan which crossed class boundaries. Taking an interest in the son of two archivists at the [[Royal Library of Alderaan/Legends|Royal Library of Alderaan]], Organa championed the young [[Halagad Ventor]]'s education and assisted him in his rise through the academy system. The two swiftly became friends and it wasn't long before Ventor was a welcomed presence around House Organa. Inspired by Ventor's desires to become a Jedi, Organa assisted the youth in pursuing his dreams by granting him access to both mental and physical training across Alderaan.<ref name=\"swcw\">''[[SkyeWalkers: A Clone Wars Story]]''</ref> In [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]],<ref name=\"Plagueis\">[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]</ref> Bail Organa's future ascent to the position of viceroy was put into question.

Eager to spend the holiday hunting [[Manka cat/Legends|manka cats]] that roamed wild on the island, Organa did not reprimand his sister or his friend as they made passes at each other. Despite Tia's proposed marriage to a nobleman of [[House Vandron]], she pursued her brother's friend during the trip all while Organa turned a blind eye. The three were out hunting when Organa received word that a [[Okonomo Tragedy|terrible tragedy]] had befallen the retreat. A [[Zeta Magnus|madman]] had infiltrated the dinner and had infected the gathered nobility with a [[hive virus]] which provoked anthropophagitism in its victims.

In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], when it became clear that the Separatists had no interest in negotiations, Organa advocated quick action but realized that the Senate would not approve using the [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|army]] found on [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]]. Organa thus voted for granting Palpatine [[Emergency Powers Act/Legends|emergency powers]]. Shortly thereafter, the Republic and the Separatists went to war against each other. The [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|First Battle of Geonosis]] marked the beginning of a pan-galactic conflict known as the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n[[File:BailOrgana-Christophsis.png|thumb|right|230px|Bail Organa leads a relief effort on a beleaguered [[Christophsis/Legends|Christophsis]].]]\n\n====Security Committee====\n{{Quote|Senator Organa, I feel the Loyalist Committee has served its purpose.

Will you take the lead?|[[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]|<ref name=\"Wild Space\" />}}\nIn the confusion that erupted after the conflict on Geonosis, Organa met with [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] and [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] as the wizened Jedi recounted the tale from the first battle of the war. After hearing Yoda's retelling, Chancellor Palpatine promoted Organa to the head of his new [[Senate Security Committee]], which was concerned with the security of the galactic senators and of the Republic as a whole. The Alderaanian prince welcomed that nomination, which he regarded as a great honor.<ref name=\"Wild Space\" /> In the days following this promotion, Organa departed Coruscant and formed an elite team to travel to [[Virgillia 7]] as part of a rescue mission to recover his old friend Padawan Ventor. Ventor had been assigned to Virgillia several months prior and had gone missing, along with Master Ettene and two other Jedi. Alongside [[Giles Durane]] and Jedi Master [[Ashka Boda]], Organa scoured war-torn Virgillia and extracted Ventor and Padawan [[Danyawarra]], leaving Ettene for dead on the planet below.<ref name=\"swcw\" />\n\nTaking an active role in the conflict, assisting in the refuge movement as much as his senatorial duties permitted. Shortly before the [[Battle of Christophsis/Legends|fighting erupted]] on [[Christophsis/Legends|Christophsis]], Organa led a [[Bail Organa's Christophsis refugee camp/Legends|relief force]] to the planet to aid the besieged people and beleaguered troops and was soon hemmed in by a Confederate [[Christophsis blockade/Legends|blockade]] led by famed [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Trench/Legends|Trench]]. Trapped on the planet's surface, Organa and his relief effort soon began to run out of food and water. When [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] led an assault against Trench's fleet in an attempt to break through and aid Organa, the Admiral responded with a withering attack, forcing the Jedi to retreat behind a [[Christophsis's moon/Legends|nearby moon]]. Trench staged several devastating attack runs against Organa's on-planet camp to draw Skywalker and Kenobi out from behind the moon, but he and his [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]] were finally broken by a [[Stealth ship/Legends|stealth ship]] manned by Skywalker and Admiral [[Wullf Yularen/Legends|Wullf Yularen]].<ref name=\"Cat and Mouse\">{{TCW|Cat and Mouse}}</ref>\n\n====Journey to Zigoola====\n[[File:Carrieduponhisshoulders.jpg|thumb|left|Organa carried Kenobi during the mission on Zigoola.]]\nA few months into the Clone Wars, Bail was given coordinates to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] planet [[Zigoola]] by his secret informant, [[Alinta]]. Having heard Senator Amidala mention the Sith in a conversation, he asked her to contact the Jedi so that he could confide in them the location of the planet. [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] was dispatched to the Senator's apartment to learn of this threat. Refusing to reveal his contact, and demanding to accompany the Jedi to the Sith world, Kenobi and Organa proceeded on a journey to [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]]. Throughout the trip, Organa and Kenobi argued and harassed each other; Kenobi attempted to kill the Senator several times after losing control of himself to the Sith spirits of the world. By the end of the trip however, the duo managed to come to a mutual respect, and even a friendship, after surviving together on the barren world. While investigating the planet, they discovered that the source of all the Sith attacks was from a [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocron]] located inside a [[Sith temple/Legends|Sith Temple]]. After destroying the holocron, and the temple in the process, Organa and Obi-Wan were rescued by Senator Amidala and team of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]].<ref name=\"Wild Space\" />\n\n====Aiding the Twi'leks====\n{{Quote|You play a dangerous game, Organa. Next time, you will not get away so easily.|Lott Dod, to Bail Organa|<ref name=\"Supply Lines\">{{TCW|Supply Lines}}</ref>}}\n[[File:BailOrganaTCW1-SWE.png|thumb|right|200px|Organa during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]]]\nAfter a successful trade mission, Organa was contacted by the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] to ask [[King/Legends|King]] [[Katuunko/Legends|Katuunko]] for permission to set up a supply base on [[Toydaria/Legends|Toydaria]] so the Republic could send relief supplies to the people of [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]], who were suffering from a droid [[Battle of Ryloth/Legends|invasion]]. Organa, aboard his personal ship, the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']], traveled to Toydaria, where he met up with the [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] Representative [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]] at the Katuunko's royal palace. Together they were granted an audience with the king and his council, but negotiations were rendered complicated by the arrival of [[Lott Dod/Legends|Lott Dod]], the Senate representative of the [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] sent by Count Dooku, who learned of Organa's mission when they intercepted his communication with the Jedi. Organa and Binks stressed their humanitarian intentions in the matter, but Dod pointed out that by agreeing to deliver supplies to Ryloth, it would be aiding Republic troops, and with Toydaria having declared strict neutrality in this war, it would destroy their neutrality. After thorough consideration, Katuunko officially denied the Republic their rights to a base on Toydaria. However, Organa and Binks were secretly met by the king, who told them that the humanitarian factor had actually gained his favor. He agreed to load the [[Pelta-class frigate/Legends|supply ships]] they already had at the time with a preliminary supply of resources if Organa could keep the involvement of Toydaria secret from. Organa protested, as the supplies would only aid the Twi'leks for a few days, but the king said this was the best he could supply. Knowing these supplies were better than none at all, the Senator created a plan to have Jar Jar distract Dod and his [[Unidentified Neimoidian aide (Lott Dod)/Legends|aide]] during a banquet, which he did with extraordinary skill, while Organa supervised the loading of the relief supplies.<ref name=\"Supply Lines\" />\n\nThe plan was successful, but when Organa and Binks were bid farewell by Katuunko, Dod protested that they had broken the agreement, as he learned of supply ships slipping through the blockade around Ryloth, a claim for which Organa demanded proof. Unable to give any, Dod left furious. However, before the diplomats departed, Katuunko announced that in the light of these events Toydaria would [[Battle of Rugosa/Legends|reconsider]] it's stance of neutrality, which was greatly appreciated by Organa.<ref name=\"Supply Lines\" />\n\n====Hostage====\nDuring the [[Senate hostage crisis/Legends|Senate hostage crisis]], Organa, along with [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] and other Senators, was taken hostage by [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane/Legends|Cad Bane]] and compatriots, who wanted to exchange their freedom for the release of [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Ziro the Hutt]]. Padm\u00e9 then told Organa she had [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker's]] [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] with her. When the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] was freed, Cad Bane and his team set the charges in the room the Senators were held in and left the building. Once safely away, Bane detonated the charges, but Bail Organa and the other Senators were saved by the Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], who managed to get them to the safe distance right before the explosion.<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>\n\n====Seeking peace over war====\nWhen the Republic Senate debated on [[Republic financial reform bill/Legends|deregulation of the banks]], Organa suggested that they should wait and see if deregulation was the best choice at the time being for the Republic, since it was deep in debt. After [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala's]] successful meeting with Separatist Senator [[Mina Bonteri/Legends|Mina Bonteri]] about the [[Separatist Senate/Legends|Separatist Parliament]] voting on peace. When the Republic heard about Separatist [[Confederate\u2013Republic peace initiative/Legends|peace bill]], Organa stated deregulation was no longer necessary. Unfortunately, during the Republic Senate's vote, the Separatist military staged a [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid/Legends|droid suicide bombing on the power generators]]. The Republic senate then voted on deregulating the banks.<ref name=\"Heroes on Both Sides\">{{TCW|Heroes on Both Sides}}</ref>\n\nAfter the bombing, [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] sent a message to the Senate, stating that the Republic launched attack on their soil, killing the sponsor of their peace bill, Senator Bonteri. After the message, Senator [[Halle Burtoni/Legends|Burtoni]] suggested that the Republic purchase 5 million more troopers, drafting a [[Republic military enhancement bill/Legends|bill]] that would raise funds for these troops from the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan/Legends|InterGalactic Banking Clan]]. Meeting with fellow Senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Onaconda Farr, Organa revealed that [[Republic Intelligence/Legends|Republic Intelligence]] confirmed that Dooku's thugs were behind the message provided to the Senate. Fighting the bill, Senators Organa and Amidala found data on the Banking Clan, revealing that they were charging 25% interest, which drained funds from social programs. Realizing the threat of this bad loan, the Senators approached other like-minded congressmen, such as Senator [[Mot-Not Rab/Legends|Mot-Not Rab]] in hopes of forming a caucus with little success. After meeting with Senator Farr, who was recently the victim of an assault, Organa himself was attacked by two bounty hunters, [[Robonino/Legends|Robonino]] and [[Chata Hyoki/Legends|Chata Hyoki]]. Protected by his [[Alderaan Guard/Legends|guards]], Organa was severely injured in the struggle, unable to speak, and therefore asked Amidala to deliver a speech that would kill the bill. Amidala was successful in swaying most of the Senators in their favor.<ref name=\"Pursuit of Peace\">{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}</ref>\n\n====The murder of Onaconda Farr====\n[[File:AmidalaOrganaDocks-SM.png|thumb|right|220px|Bail Organa and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] investigate [[Onaconda Farr/Legends|Onaconda Farr's]] murder.]]\nAfter Organa recovered from the attempted attack, he worked closely with Senators Amidala, Mon Mothma, and Farr in their effort to [[Reduced military spending bill/Legends|reduce and eventually halt]] the production of clone troopers and end the fighting. Shortly after a monumental speech by Amidala urging the Galactic Senate to vote for such a movement, Farr became ill during a celebratory meeting, dying soon after. Organa, along with his allies, attended the funeral, and was present in Chancellor Palpatine's office afterwards when [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Tan Divo/Legends|Tan Divo]] reported that Farr's death was in fact a murder. When Organa and Amidala, along with Mothma and the late Farr's aide [[Lolo Purs/Legends|Lolo Purs]] expressed a discontent in Divo's investigation methods, the two set out to find the murderer themselves. Speaking with two of Farr's greatest political enemies, Senators [[Mee Deechi/Legends|Mee Deechi]] and [[Halle Burtoni/Legends|Halle Burtoni]], they discovered that Farr had held several secretive meetings within Coruscant's docking area. After setting out to the locale only to be shot at, lose their attacker, and be thoroughly reprimanded by Lt. Divo, Organa and Amidala returned to Deechi's office under the suspicion that he set them up, only to discover the [[Umbaran/Legends|Umbaran]] dead, stabbed through the heart. Divo quickly shut them in his heavily guarded office with Mothma and Purs for protection, although Farr's former aide expressed an immediate discontent with the situation and stormed out. She returned soon after, claiming to have been attacked by Senator Burtoni, who was soon arrested and charged for murder. As the Kaminoan was being led out in handcuffs, Amidala had one last memory, that Farr was killed by a poison specifically engineered towards Rodians and Lolo Purs had not partaken in any refreshments that day. Caught at last, Purs held Amidala captive for a short while before the Senator was able to escape and knock her unconscious, allowing Divo to arrest the culprit and release the innocent Burtoni.<ref name=\"Senate Murders\">{{TCW|Senate Murders}}</ref>\n\n===Rising concerns===\n[[File:Bails_XJ2.png|thumb|left|220px|Organa in his modified [[Narglatch AirTech/Legends|Narglatch]] [[XJ-2 airspeeder]]]]\nAs the Clone Wars dragged on, Organa became concerned about Palpatine's growing powers. Because of his newfound relationship with Kenobi, Organa started cultivating a friendly relationship with the Jedi High Council, which was also concerned, and began seeking out similarly wary Senators. As a diplomat, Organa was often on the front lines of the war; he was engaged in actual fighting during both the [[Battle of Boz Pity (Clone Wars)|Battle of Boz Pity]]<ref name=\"Star Wars: Obsession\">''[[Star Wars: Obsession]]''</ref> and the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|Battle of Coruscant]], although he fought involuntarily in the latter.<ref name=\"Labyrinth of Evil\">''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]''</ref> He also visited [[Qalydon/Legends|Qalydon]]<ref name=\"Pello Scrambas\" /> and [[Metalorn/Legends|Metalorn]],<ref name=\"Bailed Out\">{{CWACite|5|Bailed Out}}</ref> and served with and befriended [[Giles Durane]], saving the man's life on more than one occasion.<ref name=\"The Weapons Master!\">{{StoryCite|story=The Weapons Master!|book=Star Wars Weekly 104|bformatted=''Star Wars Weekly'' 104}}</ref>\n\nAfter Organa's vessel was [[Attack on Senator Organa|attacked by pirates]], the Senate was going to vote on an [[Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act]]. Finis Valorum soon infiltrated Organa's 500 Republica apartment, tired of watching from the sidelines. Valorum believed that Palpatine was power hungry and would not give up his emergency powers once the war was over, destroying everything in his way. Unfortunately, Palpatine had cameras in many droids, having recorded their conversations. Organa tried bringing up the subject in the Senate, but a bombing on Valorum's transport issued the Senate to go through with the act anyway.<ref name=\"Republic 61: Dead Ends\">[[Republic 61|''Republic'' 61]]</ref>\n\n===Last days of the Republic===\n{{Quote|What's going on here?''\"<br />\"''There's been a rebellion, sir.

Kenobi, having defeated his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker who had fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], arrived with the droids [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and a pregnant Padm\u00e9, who was in a critical condition. The medical team who tried to save her discovered that she was dying, having apparently lost the will to live.

In the [[Royal Palace of Alderaan/Legends|Grand Hall]] of the [[Royal Palace of Alderaan/Legends|Royal Palace of Alderaan]], Organa received the rebel agents, and sent them on a mission to [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]] to rescue the disillusioned Imperial Admiral [[Gilder Varth]] from the detention facility on that planet.<ref name=\"The Traitor's Gambit\">''[[Dawn of Defiance]]'': ''[[The Traitor's Gambit]]''</ref>\n\nSmall, covert operations like this were typical during the first decade of the Empire. Organized resistance did not come until later. A significant event that spurred Organa and his allies to discuss open rebellion was the [[Ghorman Massacre/Legends|Ghorman Massacre]] in circa [[18 BBY/Legends|18 BBY]]: during a protest against Imperial taxation on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ghorman/Legends|Ghorman]] in the [[Sern sector/Legends|Sern sector]], [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]] landed his ship right on the protesters, injuring and killing hundreds. This horrified many, but the Emperor was pleased and gave Tarkin a promotion. In secret, Organa and Mothma, sometimes accompanied by Bel Iblis, began having regular [[Cantham House Meetings|meetings]] in Organa's Coruscant residence to discuss organized resistance.\n\nDespite these ties to the Rebellion, Organa was outwardly one of the most loyal of Imperial Senators, and greatly respected by many. This could be why Emperor Palpatine never attempted to kill him, while showing no such restraint with his fellow Alliance co-founders.\n\nSecretly, Organa was preparing for the day when his war against the Empire would turn public, and set about recruiting surviving Jedi to join his cause&mdash;one such Jedi was [[Ylenic It'kla]], who served as [[Trustant]] of the Alderaanian [[Caamasi Remnant]] and as an advisor to Organa himself. Senator [[Silya Shessaun/Legends|Silya Shessaun]] also worked behind the scenes with Organa, aiding him in forming the Rebellion and also helping raise his adopted daughter, Leia.<ref name=\"Silya Shessaun\" />\n\nDuring the rise of the Empire Organa used his political position to covertly aid resistance groups, particularly those in the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]]. Using a network of diplomatic operatives, he quietly leaked useful information to the planetary rulers, dissidents in hiding and insurgent fighters who might employ that information against the Emperor.<ref name=\"TFU Campaign Guide\" />\n\n[[File:GoodbyeAlderaan-SWGS6.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Organa hugs his adoptive daughter in what will be their final farewell.]]\nAfter failing to convince Jedi Master [[Rahm Kota/Legends|Rahm Kota]] to rescue his adopted daughter Leia, who was arrested by Imperials and held prisoner on Kashyyyk, he attempted to do the same with another Jedi Master, [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]], who was hiding on [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]]. But when he arrived, he found that Shaak Ti was dead. Furthermore, he was captured by Shaak Ti's old apprentice, [[Maris Brood]]. He was held prisoner until [[Galen Marek]], who was advised by Kota to rescue him so his soon to be formed rebellion would receive support from a politician, arrived. Marek defeated Maris and let her go. Bail was disappointed how Marek chose to let Maris go and told him that her fall reminded him too much of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|another Jedi]] who turned to the dark side after the Clone Wars ended, but did not say his name. Marek told him it was for the best since she'll carry the memories of what she did.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nLater, Marek had also rescued Leia just before coming to Felucia because it would help him to gain support from Organa. After his rescue, Bail said that armed resistance against the Empire needed to be proven as a possibility before he and the other Senators took action. Marek, in response, attacked and destroyed a [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] shipyard orbiting [[Raxus Prime/Legends|Raxus Prime]]. This act proved to Bail that the Empire could be defeated in battle.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nA historical moment for the Rebellion was the signing of the [[Corellian Treaty]] in circa [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]]. Signed by Organa, Mothma, and Bel Iblis, with Marek and Kota also present, the document formalized the relationship between the [[Corellian Resistance/Legends|Corellian]], [[Alderaanian Resistance|Alderaanian]] and [[Chandrilan resistance|Chandrilan]] resistance forces, respectively, from a loose coalition to an organized rebellion&mdash;the Alliance to Restore the Republic. However, Darth Vader arrived moments later and his [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] arrested Bail and everyone else. Bail ordered the [[Holodroid/Legends|holodroid]] [[PROXY]] to cut off Leia's transmission so that Vader would not know she was involved. Marek was really Vader's secret apprentice, and had lured the Senators willing to rebel against Emperor Palpatine into the open. Bail and the other Senators were taken to the under construction [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star I]], and it seemed that the Rebellion was doomed before it even began.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nMarek, however, had turned to the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side of the Force]] after being betrayed by Vader, who in fact deceived him by telling Marek that they would use the rebellion to overthrow Emperor Palpatine, and journeyed to the Death Star. There, Marek defeated Vader and held Palpatine off long enough for Bail and the other rebels to escape. Marek selflessly sacrificed himself to give the others time to escape.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nAlong with Kota and [[Juno Eclipse/Legends|Juno Eclipse]], Marek's pilot, Bail returned to Corellia to salvage PROXY to help fill in the gaps of the Birth of the Alliance, starting with the history of Marek.

But the senator's rigor was not only about appearance; unlike many self-absorbed and corrupt delegates, Organa took his senatorial duties seriously. He spent much of his free time working on both legislative and domestic matters.<ref name=\"Wild Space\" /> In the ancient times, his professionalism would have been considered with respect. However, amid the moral decay of the dying Republic, Organa's impassioned defense of the civic virtue was often derided by his corrupted peers.<ref name=\"AOCV\">''[[Star Wars: Attack of the Clones: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> However, despite his undeniable diplomatic skills and usually reserved behavior, Organa could appear casual to the point that Obi-Wan Kenobi once compared him to a Corellian bartender&mdash;except for the profanities.<ref name=\"Wild Space\" />\n\nOrgana was very devoted to preserving peace throughout the galaxy and was one of the few Senators who was not corrupted by power or by Chancellor Palpatine. He was very loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Order and did everything he could to help the Jedi during Order 66 and the Jedi Purge. He believed that without the Republic, the galaxy would fall into chaos and without the Jedi Order there would be no peacekeepers to help bring an end to chaos. Organa was strong minded and refused to submit to the rule of Emperor Palpatine. He also displayed enough courage to stand up to the Emperor himself telling him that if he and his allies were to die the Emperor would only cause more people to hate him.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nAlthough an intelligent man and an innovative strategist, Organa tended to act on faith instead of playing safe. He was not afraid to take risks if the benefits justified the costs, and he would learn quickly from his mistakes. For a politician, Organa had unusual skills such as the ability to pilot a starship by himself.<ref name=\"Wild Space\" /> A polyglot, Organa could speak not only [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]], but also [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]], [[Mon Calamari (language)/Legends|Mon Calamarian]],<ref name=\"Gamer10\">{{GamerCite|10|Galactic Power Brokers}}</ref> and [[Gran (language)/Legends|Gran]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nAs a private man, Organa was also a loving husband to his wife Breha, whom he called \"my dove.\" During the time of the Republic, his Senatorial duties kept him away from Alderaan, and Bail Organa could rarely spend much time with his wife in Aldera. Although he qualified himself as a \"neglectful husband\", he paid the Queen lightning visits whenever possible.<ref name=\"CWG:St\">''[[Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth]]''</ref> Later in life, the Viceroy Organa also became a loving father to Leia, his adopted daughter.<ref name=\"LoJ:MD\" /> When the opportunity arose, Organa enjoyed a good drink.

Subsequently, he was Senator of the Alderaan sector of the Imperial Senate from 19 BBY to 1 BBY. He was Princess Leia Organas adoptive father and a friend of Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Rahm Kota, and Jedi Knight Ylenic Itkla. He was also a friend and colleague of Leia's biological mother, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and was present when Leia and her twin brother Luke Skywalker were born. He was married to Queen Breha Organa. One of the main founders of the Rebel Alliance, he was killed when the Death Star obliterated Alderaan. In the Alliance and its successor states, the New Republic and Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, he was respected as a martyr who died for his cause.\n\n\u2022 Biography\n\n\u2022 Early life\n\nBail Prestor Organa, a male Human, was a native of Alderaan, a planet of pristine beauty the inhabitants of which were among the Core Founders of the Galactic Republic. Born in 67 BBY, his parents were two of the most important people on his homeworld. His mother Mazicia was the reigning queen of Alderaan, and his father belonged to the prestigious House of Organa, one of the princely dynasties among which the crown of Alderaan traditionally befell. He also had three sisters: Rouge, Celly, and Tia. Additionally, his maternal uncle Tayvor Mandirly was a notorious agricultural expert. Like all the scions of his noble bloodline, the young Organa enjoyed a golden childhood. While he always had all the material things he needed, Organas parents were careful never to spoil him. As a youth, Bail Organa was trained to eventually take up Alderaans seat in the Galactic Senate. Despite the rampant corruption that had spread its tentacles to most of the political class, the actions of civic-minded statesmen such as Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum finally convinced Organa that he could do well in the Senate.\nDespite his pampered upbringing, Organa maintained many personal acquaintances across Alderaan which crossed class boundaries. Taking an interest in the son of two archivists at the Royal Library of Alderaan, Organa championed the young Halagad Ventors education and assisted him in his rise through the academy system. The two swiftly became friends and it wasnt long before Ventor was a welcomed presence around House Organa. Inspired by Ventors desires to become a Jedi, Organa assisted the youth in pursuing his dreams by granting him access to both mental and physical training across Alderaan.SkyeWalkers: A Clone Wars Story In 32 BBY,Darth Plagueis Bail Organas future ascent to the position of viceroy was put into question. That year, Alderaan was wracked by the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention, a bitter feud between House Organa and the rival House Antilles over which family had the proper claim to the title of viceroy.Scrambas, Pello After three deadlocked votes, the High Council of AlderaanAlderaan appealed to the Galactic Senate for mediation, and a special dispatch led by the Jedi Master Jorus Cbaoth was sent to oversee the dispute. During this time, Organa became acquainted with the Jedi Knight Everen Ettene who championed his cause and the two maintained a positive relationship. In less than one month, Cbaoth guided the tribunal to a decision that favored the Organas. Subsequently, Organas father was made viceroy and the rivaling families were joined together in marriage at the Jedis behest.\nIn the wake of the standoff, the victorious Organa family decided to celebrate by sending young Organa, his sister Tia and the Ventor family as their representatives to the Okonomo Retreat on the beautiful island resort. Eager to spend the holiday hunting manka cats that roamed wild on the island, Organa did not reprimand his sister or his friend as they made passes at each other. Despite Tias proposed marriage to a nobleman of House Vandron, she pursued her brothers friend during the trip all while Organa turned a blind eye. The three were out hunting when Organa received word that a terrible tragedy had befallen the retreat. A madman had infiltrated the dinner and had infected the gathered nobility with a hive virus which provoked anthropophagitism in its victims. Among the victims were both of Ventors parents, Ean and Zollet, who in their madness ate each other before being consumed by the madman.\nAt some point when it seemed that the old Republic was already crumbling, a group of Alderaanian scouts under the responsibility of First Chairman Organa discovered the remote and mineral-rich planet of Isis. Bail Organa, who foresaw a time of turmoil in the not-too-distant future, chose to to keep information about this world secret, only revealing its existence to his close political allies.The Isis Coordinates\n\n\u2022 Becoming a Senator\n\nIn 32 BBY, the peaceful planet Naboo was invaded by the droid army of the Trade Federation, a labyrinthine organization of trade officials, which provoked a crisis in the Galactic Senate. Padm\u00e9 Amidala, queen of the Naboo, came to plead her case before the Senate and, seeing that Valorum would not react, she called for a Vote of No Confidence in the Chancellor.I Despite not being a senator, Bail Organa was present in the plenary chamber, and he stepped out to second the motion, as did the Roonan delegate Edcel Bar Gane.Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace novelization Before the chair could find a motive to postpone the vote, Organa argued that the motion could suffer no delay, since it was on the floor and had to be voted during the ongoing session.\nBail Organa of Alderaan in 22 BBY]]\nFollowing the election of Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor, Senator Bail Antilles chose to retire, and Organa succeeded him.Antilles, Bail In order to occupy that position, he was forced to abandon his viceroyship, delegating his powers to a regent.Bail Organa Though a new Senator, he quickly gained the ear of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, agreeing with his view on bureaucratic stagnation. He also established political relationships with other like minded Senators, including Garm Bel Iblis of Corellia, Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, Doman Beruss of Illodia, and Mon Mothma of Chandrila, with whom he had a very good personal friendship. His residence on Coruscant during his time as a Senator was called Cantham House, although he had an apartment in 500 Republica as well. Organa also became close friends with former Chancellor Valorum. Despite his elevated position, Organa remained committed to his friends. Approached by Halagad Ventor after the young man had spent some time at the Jedi academy on Almas, Ventor expressed frustration regarding his inability to find a master that would train him in the ways of the Jedi. To assist, Organa arranged for a meeting with his old contact within the Order: Everen Ettene. Speaking with the Jedi Knight and vouching for Ventors dedication and hard-work, Ettene saw something of herself in Ventor and agreed to train the unconventional Padawan.\nIn 28 BBY, Organa took in his turn the mantle of viceroy,Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1 which he would keep till his death. As such, he was properly addressed as \"His Serene Highness, Prince Bail Prestor Organa, First Chairman and Viceroy of Alderaan.\"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II novelization In the years that followed Organas appointment as a senator, the Republic went through an unprecedented crisis. The former Jedi Master Dooku, Count of Serenno, founded the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a loose organization of planets who wished to withdraw from the Republic.The New Essential Chronology' During that Separatist Crisis, Organa pushed to have Alderaan loosen its immigration restrictions to allow refugee resettlement. He was also appointed to the Loyalist Committee, a political group determined to keep the Republic from fragmenting under the Separatist influence.Palpatine forms Loyalist Committee Though not a militarist, it was expected he would vote in favor of creating an army to defend the Republic. In 22 BBY, when it became clear that the Separatists had no interest in negotiations, Organa advocated quick action but realized that the Senate would not approve using the clone army found on Kamino. Organa thus voted for granting Palpatine emergency powers. Shortly thereafter, the Republic and the Separatists went to war against each other. The First Battle of Geonosis marked the beginning of a pan-galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars.\n\n\u2022 The Clone Wars\n\n.]]\n\n\u2022 Security Committee\n\nPalpatine]]\nIn the confusion that erupted after the conflict on Geonosis, Organa met with Grand Master Yoda and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as the wizened Jedi recounted the tale from the first battle of the war. After hearing Yoda's retelling, Chancellor Palpatine promoted Organa to the head of his new Senate Security Committee, which was concerned with the security of the galactic senators and of the Republic as a whole. The Alderaanian prince welcomed that nomination, which he regarded as a great honor. In the days following this promotion, Organa departed Coruscant and formed an elite team to travel to Virgillia 7 as part of a rescue mission to recover his old friend Padawan Ventor. Ventor had been assigned to Virgillia several months prior and had gone missing, along with Master Ettene and two other Jedi. Alongside Giles Durane and Jedi Master Ashka Boda, Organa scoured war-torn Virgillia and extracted Ventor and Padawan Danyawarra, leaving Ettene for dead on the planet below.\nTaking an active role in the conflict, assisting in the refuge movement as much as his senatorial duties permitted. Shortly before the fighting erupted on Christophsis, Organa led a relief force to the planet to aid the besieged people and beleaguered troops and was soon hemmed in by a Confederate blockade led by famed Admiral Trench. Trapped on the planets surface, Organa and his relief effort soon began to run out of food and water. When Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi led an assault against Trenchs fleet in an attempt to break through and aid Organa, the Admiral responded with a withering attack, forcing the Jedi to retreat behind a nearby moon. Trench staged several devastating attack runs against Organa's on-planet camp to draw Skywalker and Kenobi out from behind the moon, but he and his blockade were finally broken by a stealth ship manned by Skywalker and Admiral Wullf Yularen.Cat and Mouse\n\n\u2022 Journey to Zigoola\n\nA few months into the Clone Wars, Bail was given coordinates to the Sith planet Zigoola by his secret informant, Alinta. Having heard Senator Amidala mention the Sith in a conversation, he asked her to contact the Jedi so that he could confide in them the location of the planet. Obi-Wan Kenobi was dispatched to the Senator's apartment to learn of this threat. Refusing to reveal his contact, and demanding to accompany the Jedi to the Sith world, Kenobi and Organa proceeded on a journey to Wild Space. Throughout the trip, Organa and Kenobi argued and harassed each other; Kenobi attempted to kill the Senator several times after losing control of himself to the Sith spirits of the world. By the end of the trip however, the duo managed to come to a mutual respect, and even a friendship, after surviving together on the barren world. While investigating the planet, they discovered that the source of all the Sith attacks was from a Sith holocron located inside a Sith Temple. After destroying the holocron, and the temple in the process, Organa and Obi-Wan were rescued by Senator Amidala and team of clone troopers.\n\n\u2022 Aiding the Twi'leks\n\nSupply Lines\n]]\nAfter a successful trade mission, Organa was contacted by the Jedi High Council to ask King Katuunko for permission to set up a supply base on Toydaria so the Republic could send relief supplies to the people of Ryloth, who were suffering from a droid invasion. Organa, aboard his personal ship, the Tantive IV, traveled to Toydaria, where he met up with the Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks at the Katuunkos royal palace. Together they were granted an audience with the king and his council, but negotiations were rendered complicated by the arrival of Lott Dod, the Senate representative of the Trade Federation sent by Count Dooku, who learned of Organas mission when they intercepted his communication with the Jedi. Organa and Binks stressed their humanitarian intentions in the matter, but Dod pointed out that by agreeing to deliver supplies to Ryloth, it would be aiding Republic troops, and with Toydaria having declared strict neutrality in this war, it would destroy their neutrality. After thorough consideration, Katuunko officially denied the Republic their rights to a base on Toydaria. However, Organa and Binks were secretly met by the king, who told them that the humanitarian factor had actually gained his favor. He agreed to load the supply ships they already had at the time with a preliminary supply of resources if Organa could keep the involvement of Toydaria secret from. Organa protested, as the supplies would only aid the Twi'leks for a few days, but the king said this was the best he could supply. Knowing these supplies were better than none at all, the Senator created a plan to have Jar Jar distract Dod and his aide during a banquet, which he did with extraordinary skill, while Organa supervised the loading of the relief supplies.\nThe plan was successful, but when Organa and Binks were bid farewell by Katuunko, Dod protested that they had broken the agreement, as he learned of supply ships slipping through the blockade around Ryloth, a claim for which Organa demanded proof. Unable to give any, Dod left furious. However, before the diplomats departed, Katuunko announced that in the light of these events Toydaria would reconsider it's stance of neutrality, which was greatly appreciated by Organa.\n\n\u2022 Hostage\n\nDuring the Senate hostage crisis, Organa, along with Padm\u00e9 Amidala and other Senators, was taken hostage by bounty hunter Cad Bane and compatriots, who wanted to exchange their freedom for the release of Ziro the Hutt. Padm\u00e9 then told Organa she had Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber with her. When the Hutt crime lord was freed, Cad Bane and his team set the charges in the room the Senators were held in and left the building. Once safely away, Bane detonated the charges, but Bail Organa and the other Senators were saved by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who managed to get them to the safe distance right before the explosion.Hostage Crisis\n\n\u2022 Seeking peace over war\n\nWhen the Republic Senate debated on deregulation of the banks, Organa suggested that they should wait and see if deregulation was the best choice at the time being for the Republic, since it was deep in debt. After Padm\u00e9 Amidalas successful meeting with Separatist Senator Mina Bonteri about the Separatist Parliament voting on peace. When the Republic heard about Separatist peace bill, Organa stated deregulation was no longer necessary. Unfortunately, during the Republic Senates vote, the Separatist military staged a droid suicide bombing on the power generators. The Republic senate then voted on deregulating the banks.Heroes on Both Sides\nAfter the bombing, Dooku sent a message to the Senate, stating that the Republic launched attack on their soil, killing the sponsor of their peace bill, Senator Bonteri. After the message, Senator Burtoni suggested that the Republic purchase 5 million more troopers, drafting a bill that would raise funds for these troops from the InterGalactic Banking Clan. Meeting with fellow Senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Onaconda Farr, Organa revealed that Republic Intelligence confirmed that Dooku's thugs were behind the message provided to the Senate. Fighting the bill, Senators Organa and Amidala found data on the Banking Clan, revealing that they were charging 25% interest, which drained funds from social programs. Realizing the threat of this bad loan, the Senators approached other like-minded congressmen, such as Senator Mot-Not Rab in hopes of forming a caucus with little success. After meeting with Senator Farr, who was recently the victim of an assault, Organa himself was attacked by two bounty hunters, Robonino and Chata Hyoki. Protected by his guards, Organa was severely injured in the struggle, unable to speak, and therefore asked Amidala to deliver a speech that would kill the bill. Amidala was successful in swaying most of the Senators in their favor.Pursuit of Peace\n\n\u2022 The murder of Onaconda Farr\n\ninvestigate Onaconda Farr's murder.]]\nAfter Organa recovered from the attempted attack, he worked closely with Senators Amidala, Mon Mothma, and Farr in their effort to reduce and eventually halt the production of clone troopers and end the fighting. Shortly after a monumental speech by Amidala urging the Galactic Senate to vote for such a movement, Farr became ill during a celebratory meeting, dying soon after. Organa, along with his allies, attended the funeral, and was present in Chancellor Palpatines office afterwards when Lieutenant Tan Divo reported that Farrs death was in fact a murder. When Organa and Amidala, along with Mothma and the late Farrs aide Lolo Purs expressed a discontent in Divos investigation methods, the two set out to find the murderer themselves. Speaking with two of Farrs greatest political enemies, Senators Mee Deechi and Halle Burtoni, they discovered that Farr had held several secretive meetings within Coruscants docking area. After setting out to the locale only to be shot at, lose their attacker, and be thoroughly reprimanded by Lt. Divo, Organa and Amidala returned to Deechis office under the suspicion that he set them up, only to discover the Umbaran dead, stabbed through the heart. Divo quickly shut them in his heavily guarded office with Mothma and Purs for protection, although Farrs former aide expressed an immediate discontent with the situation and stormed out. She returned soon after, claiming to have been attacked by Senator Burtoni, who was soon arrested and charged for murder. As the Kaminoan was being led out in handcuffs, Amidala had one last memory, that Farr was killed by a poison specifically engineered towards Rodians and Lolo Purs had not partaken in any refreshments that day. Caught at last, Purs held Amidala captive for a short while before the Senator was able to escape and knock her unconscious, allowing Divo to arrest the culprit and release the innocent Burtoni.Senate Murders\n\n\u2022 Rising concerns\n\nXJ-2 airspeeder]]\nAs the Clone Wars dragged on, Organa became concerned about Palpatines growing powers. Because of his newfound relationship with Kenobi, Organa started cultivating a friendly relationship with the Jedi High Council, which was also concerned, and began seeking out similarly wary Senators. As a diplomat, Organa was often on the front lines of the war; he was engaged in actual fighting during both the Battle of Boz PityStar Wars: Obsession and the Battle of Coruscant, although he fought involuntarily in the latter.Labyrinth of Evil He also visited Qalydon and Metalorn, and served with and befriended Giles Durane, saving the mans life on more than one occasion.\nAfter Organas vessel was attacked by pirates, the Senate was going to vote on an Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act. Finis Valorum soon infiltrated Organas 500 Republica apartment, tired of watching from the sidelines. Valorum believed that Palpatine was power hungry and would not give up his emergency powers once the war was over, destroying everything in his way. Unfortunately, Palpatine had cameras in many droids, having recorded their conversations. Organa tried bringing up the subject in the Senate, but a bombing on Valorums transport issued the Senate to go through with the act anyway.Republic' 61\n\n\u2022 Last days of the Republic\n\nAppo]]\nwith like-minded Senators.]]\nDuring the Great Jedi Purge, after witnessing clone troopers gun down Padawan Zett Jukassa, Organa was determined to intercept any surviving Jedi before they \"walked into this catastrophe.\" Organa managed to locate and rescue Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi. When he took them back to Coruscant, he sat with Padm\u00e9 Amidala as Palpatine declared himself Galactic Emperor. Despite his revulsion at the concept, Amidala told him to vote in favor of Palpatine, both being outnumbered and realizing the added benefits that time and access to Imperial knowledge would have on a resistance movement.\nAfter Yoda's failed attempt to kill Palpatine at the Grand Convocation Chamber of the Senate Building, Organa managed to rescue the Jedi Master before security could find him. They then fled Coruscant to the planetoid Polis Massa and contacted Kenobi on the planet Mustafar. Kenobi, having defeated his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker who had fallen to the dark side of the Force, arrived with the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 and a pregnant Padm\u00e9, who was in a critical condition. The medical team who tried to save her discovered that she was dying, having apparently lost the will to live. However, before her death Padm\u00e9 managed to give birth to healthy twins, Luke and Leia Skywalker.\n\n\u2022 Adopting Leia\n\n, holding their newly adopted daughter]]\nBail Organa, volunteering to adopt Leia\nArriving on Naboo, Bail and the Jedi discussed the fate of the twins. Organa offered to take Leia as his own, having for a long time discussed adopting a baby girl with his wife Breha; they had had many difficulties in producing an heir, and doctors had informed them that another attempt to conceive a child would probably kill Breha.\nOrgana also took the droids into his service (and ordered C-3POs memory wiped to keep the chatty droid from someday accidentally revealing Leias true parentage), placing them in the care of Tantive IV captain Raymus Antilles. Along with Mon Mothma, Organa attended Padm\u00e9s funeral on Naboo. He continued to serve in the Senate well into the days of the Galactic Empire, where he remained a representative for Alderaan until his adopted daughter Leia took over one year before the Battle of Yavin. Bail was one of the few people in the galaxy who were aware that Palpatine was a Sith Lord, presumably having been informed of this by Yoda.Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader\nDespite the Viceroys sheer affection for his daughter, on the whole, the young Leia had far more meals with servants and household droids than with Organa.Ambush at Corellia He mostly entrusted the princess education to an army of experts, which included Amidalas former handmaiden Sab\u00e9, who tutored her in matters of court etiquette and diplomacy,The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide the scholar Arn Horada, who instructed her in galactic politics and history,Star Wars (1977) 30 and the former senator of the Thesme sector Silya Shessaun.Shessaun, Silya While Queen Breha had been extensively involved with Leias education in the latters early years,The Last of the Jedi: Master of Deception the princess later girlhood was was mainly marked by the Viceroy's sisters, Rouge, Celly and Tia Organa.\n\n\u2022 Father of the Rebellion\n\nand Galen Marek on Kashyyyk]]\nBail Organa was instrumental to the creation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, together with Senators Mothma and Bel Iblis.\nSeveral months after the foundation of the Empire, Organa met with the crew of the Banshee on Alderaan, to discuss resistance to the new regime. In the Grand Hall of the Royal Palace of Alderaan, Organa received the rebel agents, and sent them on a mission to Felucia to rescue the disillusioned Imperial Admiral Gilder Varth from the detention facility on that planet.Dawn of Defiance: The Traitors Gambit\nSmall, covert operations like this were typical during the first decade of the Empire. Organized resistance did not come until later. A significant event that spurred Organa and his allies to discuss open rebellion was the Ghorman Massacre in circa 18 BBY: during a protest against Imperial taxation on the planet Ghorman in the Sern sector, Wilhuff Tarkin landed his ship right on the protesters, injuring and killing hundreds. This horrified many, but the Emperor was pleased and gave Tarkin a promotion. In secret, Organa and Mothma, sometimes accompanied by Bel Iblis, began having regular meetings in Organa's Coruscant residence to discuss organized resistance.\nDespite these ties to the Rebellion, Organa was outwardly one of the most loyal of Imperial Senators, and greatly respected by many. This could be why Emperor Palpatine never attempted to kill him, while showing no such restraint with his fellow Alliance co-founders.\nSecretly, Organa was preparing for the day when his war against the Empire would turn public, and set about recruiting surviving Jedi to join his cause&mdash;one such Jedi was Ylenic It'kla, who served as Trustant of the Alderaanian Caamasi Remnant and as an advisor to Organa himself. Senator Silya Shessaun also worked behind the scenes with Organa, aiding him in forming the Rebellion and also helping raise his adopted daughter, Leia.\nDuring the rise of the Empire Organa used his political position to covertly aid resistance groups, particularly those in the Core Worlds. Using a network of diplomatic operatives, he quietly leaked useful information to the planetary rulers, dissidents in hiding and insurgent fighters who might employ that information against the Emperor.\nAfter failing to convince Jedi Master Rahm Kota to rescue his adopted daughter Leia, who was arrested by Imperials and held prisoner on Kashyyyk, he attempted to do the same with another Jedi Master, Shaak Ti, who was hiding on Felucia. But when he arrived, he found that Shaak Ti was dead. Furthermore, he was captured by Shaak Tis old apprentice, Maris Brood. He was held prisoner until Galen Marek, who was advised by Kota to rescue him so his soon to be formed rebellion would receive support from a politician, arrived. Marek defeated Maris and let her go. Bail was disappointed how Marek chose to let Maris go and told him that her fall reminded him too much of another Jedi who turned to the dark side after the Clone Wars ended, but did not say his name. Marek told him it was for the best since shell carry the memories of what she did.\nLater, Marek had also rescued Leia just before coming to Felucia because it would help him to gain support from Organa. After his rescue, Bail said that armed resistance against the Empire needed to be proven as a possibility before he and the other Senators took action. Marek, in response, attacked and destroyed a Star Destroyer shipyard orbiting Raxus Prime. This act proved to Bail that the Empire could be defeated in battle.\nA historical moment for the Rebellion was the signing of the Corellian Treaty in circa 2 BBY. Signed by Organa, Mothma, and Bel Iblis, with Marek and Kota also present, the document formalized the relationship between the Corellian, Alderaanian and Chandrilan resistance forces, respectively, from a loose coalition to an organized rebellion&mdash;the Alliance to Restore the Republic. However, Darth Vader arrived moments later and his stormtroopers arrested Bail and everyone else. Bail ordered the holodroid PROXY to cut off Leias transmission so that Vader would not know she was involved. Marek was really Vaders secret apprentice, and had lured the Senators willing to rebel against Emperor Palpatine into the open. Bail and the other Senators were taken to the under construction Death Star I, and it seemed that the Rebellion was doomed before it even began.\nMarek, however, had turned to the light side of the Force after being betrayed by Vader, who in fact deceived him by telling Marek that they would use the rebellion to overthrow Emperor Palpatine, and journeyed to the Death Star. There, Marek defeated Vader and held Palpatine off long enough for Bail and the other rebels to escape. Marek selflessly sacrificed himself to give the others time to escape.\nAlong with Kota and Juno Eclipse, Mareks pilot, Bail returned to Corellia to salvage PROXY to help fill in the gaps of the Birth of the Alliance, starting with the history of Marek. After meeting on Kashyyyk, the rebel leaders found Mareks family crest, and Leia suggested honoring Marek by using it as the symbol for the Rebel Alliance. The other rebels agreed.\nMothma and Bel Iblis often clashed on strategy and policy, and it was usually Organa that kept the new Alliance from splitting apart.\nIn 1 BBY, leaders of the Alliance decided to set their new secret headquarters on the fourth moon of Yavin Prime after being forced to secretly abandon their former base on Dantooine. Should that base ever be discovered by the Empire, Organa created a holocron encased in near-indestructible phrik, which contained a list of possible replacement planets. The former senator kept that precious holocron with him on Alderaan.Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron'\n\n\u2022 Death\n\nStar Wars' (1977) 53]]\nIn 0 BBY, after acquiring Imperial plans to the Death Star, Organa sent his daughter, Leia, on a mission to recruit exiled Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi for the Rebel cause. However, Leia was arrested above Tatooine by Darth Vader himself. Back on Alderaan, her father received a falsified report stating that the Tantive IV had encountered an unexpected meteorite field it could not avoid, and had gone down with all hands on board.Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope novel Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi never made it to Alderaan, and the planet was about to face certain doom. On a warm evening late in the spring, Bail Organa perished when Wilhuff Tarkin, now a Grand Moff, ordered the destruction of Alderaan using the Death Star's superlaser, annihilating its population. Organa was among the 2 billion people who died instantly.\n\n\u2022 Personality and traits\n\nTyrants Test\nBail Organa was a tall, dark-haired Human with tan skin and brown eyes, whose traits were regarded as aesthetically pleasing by other members of his species. He was known for wearing elegant and meticulous clothes in the style of the Republic Classic era. A self-aware politician, Bail Organa always appeared neatly presented. But the senators rigor was not only about appearance; unlike many self-absorbed and corrupt delegates, Organa took his senatorial duties seriously. He spent much of his free time working on both legislative and domestic matters. In the ancient times, his professionalism would have been considered with respect. However, amid the moral decay of the dying Republic, Organas impassioned defense of the civic virtue was often derided by his corrupted peers.Star Wars: Attack of the Clones: The Visual Dictionary However, despite his undeniable diplomatic skills and usually reserved behavior, Organa could appear casual to the point that Obi-Wan Kenobi once compared him to a Corellian bartender&mdash;except for the profanities.\nOrgana was very devoted to preserving peace throughout the galaxy and was one of the few Senators who was not corrupted by power or by Chancellor Palpatine. He was very loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Order and did everything he could to help the Jedi during Order 66 and the Jedi Purge. He believed that without the Republic, the galaxy would fall into chaos and without the Jedi Order there would be no peacekeepers to help bring an end to chaos. Organa was strong minded and refused to submit to the rule of Emperor Palpatine. He also displayed enough courage to stand up to the Emperor himself telling him that if he and his allies were to die the Emperor would only cause more people to hate him.\nAlthough an intelligent man and an innovative strategist, Organa tended to act on faith instead of playing safe. He was not afraid to take risks if the benefits justified the costs, and he would learn quickly from his mistakes. For a politician, Organa had unusual skills such as the ability to pilot a starship by himself. A polyglot, Organa could speak not only Galactic Basic Standard, but also Shyriiwook, Mon Calamarian, and Gran.\nAs a private man, Organa was also a loving husband to his wife Breha, whom he called \"my dove.\" During the time of the Republic, his Senatorial duties kept him away from Alderaan, and Bail Organa could rarely spend much time with his wife in Aldera. Although he qualified himself as a \"neglectful husband\", he paid the Queen lightning visits whenever possible.Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth Later in life, the Viceroy Organa also became a loving father to Leia, his adopted daughter. When the opportunity arose, Organa enjoyed a good drink. He was known to favor Blackmoon ale with a twist of blue sarsata peel and white wine produced by the House of Organa's own vineyard; Algarine wines were his favorite vintage.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\n\u2022 Origins\n\nAn early incarnation of Bail Organa, in a rough draft of Star Wars\nThe origins of the character of Bail Organa can be found in the early drafts of the original Star Wars film. George Lucass 132-page rough draft of \"The Star Wars,\" completed in May 1974, includes a character named Bail Antilles who is a galactic trader and a confederate of the Aquillian Ranger Clieg Whitsun. In 1975s Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars, Antilles is himself an Aquillian Ranger and an agent of the Starkiller; later drafts cemented the character as the father of Princess Leia of Ogana Major.The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film When Ogana Major was renamed Alderaan, the word \"Ogana\" became Leias last name, albeit slightly respelled.Alderaan Bail Antilles was accordingly renamed Bail Organa, and went on to be mentioned by name in both the script and novelization of the original Star Wars film, although he was referred to simply as Leias father in the film itself. An issue of the films comic book adaptation erroneously calls Leias father Bail Antilles.Star Wars (1977) 2 Organa first appeared in \"Points of Origin,\" an episode of the 1981 Star Wars radio drama, where he was portrayed as Alderaans ruler and was called \"Prestor\" in the scriptStar Wars: The National Public Radio Dramatization and closing credits.Points of Origin Taking the cue that \"Bail\" might be a title, A. C. Crispin named the character \"Bail Prestor Organa\" in her 1997 novel The Paradise Snare'.\nOrgana was slated to appear in 1999s Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and was written into the screenplay as the seconder of Queen Amidalas call for a Vote of No Confidence in Chancellor Valorums leadership. Star Wars creator George Lucas initially approached the English actor Ray Winstone to portray Princess Leias stepfather. The two met in a hotel in the West End of London, but the meeting did not go to plan. Winstone was admittedly inebriated from the night before when he turned up for the audition. On his part, Lucas felt the effects of the jet-lag, which prompted him to yawn regularly. Additionally, Winstone asserts that Lucas instantly knew he was wrong for the part as soon as the actor walked in the room, but chose to relay the message through a third party&mdash;something at which Winstone took umbrage.\nEventually, actor Adrian Dunbar was cast in the role and filmed the scenes, although they were ultimately cut from the films final product. In his 2001 novel Cloak of Deception, author James Luceno described Dunbars appearance when writing the character of Bail Antilles, a character mentioned briefly in Episode I who had been intended to be a separate character from Organa, despite both being Senators from Alderaan named Bail. When Jimmy Smits was cast as Organa for 2002s Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, the Star Wars Expanded Universe visually solidified Dunbars character as Antilles, and Smitss as Organa.Senator Horox Ryyder Retires Although the issue has been clarified, it is noteworthy that some official materials related to Episode I went to print in 1999 identifying Dunbars character as Bail Organa.Mistaken Identities\n\n\u2022 Portrayal\n\nEpisode II Casting Director Robin Gurland\nStephen Elliott voiced Organa in the Star Wars radio dramatization. Adrian Dunbar played the character in scenes from Star Wars Episode I that were ultimately excised from the film. Jimmy Smits likeness has since been used to represent the character.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed graphic novel Episode II Casting Director Robin Gurland was considering Smits for the role of Organa when his agents contacted her and informed her that he was interested in becoming involved with Star Wars'.\n\n\u2022 In Star Wars media\n\nOrgana has appeared in a number of works of the Expanded Universe. Prior to the Star Wars prequel trilogy, he was featured in the Star Wars radio drama and the novel The Paradise Snare.The Paradise Snare More recently, he has appeared in a number of materials related to the Clone Wars, both in the original multimedia projectRepublic 63 and the more recent one.\n\n\u2022 Non-canon history\n\nAidan Hennessy, author of the StarWars.com Databank What's The Story? entry on Pello Scrambas, has stated that Scrambass entry was originally written as indicating that Organas marriage to Queen Breha was arranged by Jedi Master Jorus Cbaoth in order to end the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention.

The species that inhabit a planet, plant and animal alike, from microbe to megalossus, are the planet-creature's organs, internal symbionts, and parasites.|[[Vergere]] to [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], as an analogy to a [[Sh'rip Sh'pa]]|<ref name=\"The New Jedi Order: Traitor\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Traitor]]''</ref>}}\nA '''planet''', often called a '''world''', was a celestial body that was in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] around a [[Star/Legends|star]], was neither a binary star nor a [[Moon/Legends|moon]], and had cleared out the area around its orbit as it formed by causing all other smaller bodies in its orbit to accrete with it. As a consequence, it would not share its orbital region with any other bodies of significant size, except for moons or those collected later under its [[Gravity/Legends|gravitational]] influence.\n\n==Overview==\nTwo types of planets existed in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]: [[Gas giant/Legends|gas giants]] and terrestrial rocky worlds. Moons orbiting gas giants and other rocky worlds were usually not considered planets, even though they could be larger or more populated than other planets. However, [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]] was considered to be both at different time periods due to its unique mobile nature.\n\n[[File:Surface_of_Balnab.png|thumb|left|125px|Some planets, like [[Balnab/Legends|Balnab]], were still going through stages of [[Sentience/Legends|organic]] development]]\nDepending on the tilt of its axis, a planet might have had varied seasons with changing temperatures and weather, affecting its habitability. Planets were extremely varied in terms of environmental conditions and landscape, ranging from completely oceanic, such as [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]], [[Dac/Legends|Dac]], and [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]], to thick arboreal rainforests, such as [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] and [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]]. Some planets, such as [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]], were completely frozen, while other planets, such as [[Nelvaan/Legends|Nelvaan]], were experiencing an ice age. Some planets, like [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]], [[Korriban/Legends|Korriban]], and [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], were completely barren and desolate, covered in little more than rock and sand; others, such as [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], became an [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]], in which the entire planetary surface was covered by one gigantic city. Many planets, like [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], and [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], contained a mix of landscapes, with various continents, oceans, and mountains.\n\nMost life-bearing planets had primarily [[Nitrogen/Legends|nitrogen]]- and [[Oxygen/Legends|oxygen]]-based [[Atmosphere/Legends|Type I atmospheres]], though some, such as [[Dorin/Legends|Dorin]], [[Gand (planet)/Legends|Gand]], and [[Skako/Legends|Skako]], had unique atmospheres to which their native life forms had adapted. [[Gas giant/Legends|Gas giants]], planets made up of primarily gaseous layers, were rarely inhabited, though they were sometimes used for resource collection (such as the [[Tibanna/Legends|Tibanna gas]] operations on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]).<!-- Things to add: various planetary sizes, rotational/orbital periods, coordinates/distance from core, gravities, etc -->\n\nSome planets had a large collection of space debris orbiting them, referred to as \"rings.\" These rings ranged from being thin to being expansive.\n\n==Sentience==\nSentience among planets, while rare, was not unheard of. [[Yuuzhan'tar]], [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]] and [[D'vouran]] were three notable examples of sentient planets.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n{{IncompleteList}}\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of planets}}\n*[[Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 1|''Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The

    "plain_text": "1\nThe New Jedi Order: Traitor'\nA planet, often called a world, was a celestial body that was in orbit around a star, was neither a binary star nor a moon, and had cleared out the area around its orbit as it formed by causing all other smaller bodies in its orbit to accrete with it. As a consequence, it would not share its orbital region with any other bodies of significant size, except for moons or those collected later under its gravitational influence.\n\n\u2022 Overview\n\nTwo types of planets existed in the galaxy: gas giants and terrestrial rocky worlds. Moons orbiting gas giants and other rocky worlds were usually not considered planets, even though they could be larger or more populated than other planets. However, Zonama Sekot was considered to be both at different time periods due to its unique mobile nature.\n, were still going through stages of organic development]]\nDepending on the tilt of its axis, a planet might have had varied seasons with changing temperatures and weather, affecting its habitability. Planets were extremely varied in terms of environmental conditions and landscape, ranging from completely oceanic, such as Manaan, Dac, and Kamino, to thick arboreal rainforests, such as Kashyyyk and Felucia. Some planets, such as Hoth, were completely frozen, while other planets, such as Nelvaan, were experiencing an ice age. Some planets, like Geonosis, Korriban, and Tatooine, were completely barren and desolate, covered in little more than rock and sand; others, such as Coruscant and Taris, became an ecumenopolis, in which the entire planetary surface was covered by one gigantic city. Many planets, like Dantooine, Naboo, Alderaan, and Corellia, contained a mix of landscapes, with various continents, oceans, and mountains.\nMost life-bearing planets had primarily nitrogen- and oxygen-based Type I atmospheres, though some, such as Dorin, Gand, and Skako, had unique atmospheres to which their native life forms had adapted. Gas giants, planets made up of primarily gaseous layers, were rarely inhabited, though they were sometimes used for resource collection (such as the Tibanna gas operations on Bespin).\nSome planets had a large collection of space debris orbiting them, referred to as \"rings.\" These rings ranged from being thin to being expansive.\n\n\u2022 Sentience\n\nSentience among planets, while rare, was not unheard of. Yuuzhantar, Zonama Sekot and Dvouran were three notable examples of sentient planets.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Han Solo Affair\n\n\u2022 Sandstorm (comic story)\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: Revenge of the Brick\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 film\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 game\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Phantom Menace DK Reader\n\n\u2022 The Epic Continues Canceled\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStay on Target]]\n\u2022 Lords of Nal Hutta\n\n\u2022 Fly Casual\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Strongholds of Resistance\n\n\u2022 Keeping the Peace\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Planet",

Some senators alternately represented very powerful megacorporations and industries, such as the Trade Federation or the Corporate Alliance.
