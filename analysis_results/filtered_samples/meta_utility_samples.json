It is my attempt to hold on to the past&hellip; to try and protect the future. ''[&hellip;]'' I tied my life, my decisions to the Jedi. Perhaps only in separating myself from the Jedi can I become myself again, learn who I am.|Atris|<ref name=\"TSL\" />}}\n'''Atris''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who served as a [[Jedi historian]], and later as a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] and [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] member during the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and the [[Jedi Civil War]]. She was deeply committed to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Order]] and was a fierce adherent of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]]. But Atris' faith in the righteousness of the Jedi wavered when her personal hero, [[Meetra Surik]], turned her back on the Council to join rogue Knights [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak|Malak]] and their [[Revanchist|faction]] of Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars. Atris chose not to go to war, but this decision left her bitter and conflicted.\n\nWhen Surik returned to face the Council's judgment after the devastating events of the [[Battle of Malachor V]], Atris was the first to condemn her, suggesting that she had fallen to the dark side just as Revan had. Over time, Atris grew to hate Surik for complicating her black-and-white view of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], and [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. During the [[Dark Wars]], Atris called a secret Jedi [[Conclave at Katarr|convocation]] on the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] world of [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]] in an attempt to find the threat that was stalking the Jedi. She then leaked knowledge of the conclave's existence in the hopes of drawing out the Sith. She succeeded, but with dire consequences; [[Darth Nihilus]] devastated the surface of the planet, wiping out all life on Katarr, including the Jedi gathered there.\n\nHowever, Atris survived, and she remained in seclusion, surrounding herself with [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] [[Handmaiden Sisters|Handmaidens]] who could not feel the Force. She planned to rebuild the Jedi Order, and established a [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi Academy]] in the old irrigation system on [[Telos IV]]. However, she was heavily influenced by the many [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]] she had collected in her efforts to find and understand the Sith. The holocrons fed her bitterness, and she slowly and quietly fell to the dark side, consequently becoming '''Darth Traya''', the '''Queen of Betrayal'''. Per the machinations of her mentor, [[Kreia]], the first [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Traya, Surik and the new Traya confronted each other once more on Telos, where Surik convinced Atris to turn away from the dark side. Atris then remained in the Jedi Academy, waiting to be judged for her actions by the new Jedi Council.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Atrisart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Atris, austere custodian of the Jedi Order]]\nAfter the [[3996 BBY|end]] of the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]] that was started by the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] and [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], the Jedi historian Atris attempted to revise the broken system of Jedi apprenticeship. She<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> argued that there was little wonder why Kun and Qel-Droma fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], when the Jedi had liberal instruction practices in place, such as dozens of [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] training under a single Master, the radical bonds of reciprocal apprenticeship, and Jedi beginning their training in their teens and later. She invoked thousand-year old recommendations first suggested by the Jedi Master [[Simikarty]], lobbying for the restriction of Padawans that a Master could have at one time, and also limiting the age of Jedi candidates.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\n\nAtris also advocated prohibiting romantic involvement for Jedi, citing that the [[First Great Schism]] had been started by two lovers. She even endorsed adoption of a more austere interpretation of the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] which was favored by the [[Draethos/Legends|Draethos]] Jedi Master [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]], in memory of his death at the hands of Exar Kun at the Jedi Academy on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]. Her arguments found powerful purchase amongst the Jedi, and she was appointed to High Council.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\n\n===The Mandalorian Wars===\n{{Quote|We all have our heroes. And when we watch them fall, we die inside. She made a choice once&hellip; and I did not.|Atris, to Brianna|<ref name=\"TSL\" />}}\nWhen the [[Mandalorian Wars]] erupted in the year [[3964 BBY]], the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] came to the Jedi for assistance. However, Atris resisted the call to protect the inhabitants of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], instead staunchly defending the council's decision to meditate and reflect before taking action.<ref name=\"FMWA\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', Exile's first visit to the Telosian Jedi Academy.</ref>\n\n[[File:Council1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Atris, sitting on the Jedi High Council in [[3963 BBY]].]]\nMany Jedi did not understand how the Council could sit idly while innocents died, and the order was split when two [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] named [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak|Malak]] chose to go to war. Many followed them, including the Jedi [[Meetra Surik]]. Atris had held a strong admiration for Surik, viewing her as something of a hero as well as a close friend. When she and Revan left the Order to join the war, rejecting everything that Atris believed in, Atris felt personally betrayed.<ref name=\"FMWA\" /> Atris condemned Revan, his followers, and the \"freethinking\" teachings of his former Jedi Master, fellow historian [[Kreia]]. Revan's eventual turn to the dark side came as little surprise to Atris.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> Indeed, when Revan met Atris years later asking what happened to Surik, Atris made little effort to conceal her contempt.<ref name=\"TOR Revan\">''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''</ref>\n\nAfter the war's end, only one of the Jedi who had followed Revan to war [[Trial of Meetra Surik|returned to face the council]]: Meetra Surik.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> She stood before them as an echo in the Force, having cut herself off from it after the final battle at [[Malachor V]]. Surik was so defiant, so certain of the rightness of her actions that she caused Atris to doubt herself. Atris wanted to punish Surik for this, and became convinced that she had fallen to the dark side along with all of the others who had followed Revan. She felt that exile was too lenient of a punishment for Surik's betrayal, and believed that she would only join Revan again if she was free. The other Masters warned her to be mindful of her feelings, but Atris insisted that Surik ought to have died at Malachor V, because when she stood before them, it was if she was already dead. The Council decided not to tell Surik that she had become a [[Wound in the Force/Legends|wound in the Force]], which was the result of her actions at Malachor.<ref name=\"FMWA\" />\n\nAtris kept [[Meetra Surik's first lightsaber|Surik's lightsaber]] after the trial, carrying it with her always. Even many years later, she insisted that the Council was right to be cautious. But deep down, she continued to question the actions of the Council, Surik, and herself.<ref name=\"FMWA\" />\n\n===Search for the Exile===\n{{Quote|Still trying to recapture your lost memories?|Atris to Revan|<ref name=\"TOR Revan\" />}}\nIn [[3954 BBY]], Revan came to the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|Temple Archives]] to find out what happened to his trusted General Meetra Surik. He accessed the file on Surik and found it lacking in information about her whereabouts. Behind him, Atris spoke out, during their conversation she revealed that Surik had disconnected herself from the Force because of the guilt she carried over her actions during the Mandalorian Wars. Although Revan felt responsible for Surik's fate, he refused to give her the satisfaction of seeing his guilt and grief. She stormed out of the room.<ref name=\"TOR Revan\" />\n\n===The Dark Wars===\n{{Quote|It is such a quiet thing, to fall. But far more terrible is to admit it.|[[Kreia]]|audio=Kreia_admit_it.flac|<ref name=\"TSL\" />}}\n[[File:Atris-KotOR2Promo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Atris, Mistress of the Archives.]]\nAfter the death of Darth Malak at the hands of a redeemed [[Revan/Legends|Revan]],<ref name=\"KotOR\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''</ref> the Jedi Order's infrastructure was decimated. To make matters worse, some ''thing'' was systematically hunting and killing what Jedi there were left. Atris rallied a secret [[Conclave at Katarr|Jedi convocation]] on [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]], a colony world of the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]], where the threat could be assessed and the future of the Order discussed.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> However, Atris leaked knowledge of the session in hopes of drawing out this threat so that it could be fought. Unfortunately, she greatly underestimated its strength. The Sith arrived in the form of [[Darth Nihilus]], who proved to be too powerful for the Jedi. Through the Force, he devoured all life on the planet, including the Jedi and Miraluka (with the single exception of [[Visas Marr]], whom he later took as his apprentice). Atris, having not attended the Conclave, survived, along with a handful of other Masters who went into hiding.<ref name=\"CotOR\">{{LucasArtsCite|url=games/swkotor_sithlords|text=''Chronicles of the Old Republic''|int=Chronicles of the Old Republic}}</ref>\n\nAtris took refuge under a polar ice cap on the planet [[Telos IV]], where she began to build a secret [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi academy]] in an old irrigation system. Here she hid most of the Jedi's most valuable artifacts and resources, including many Sith holocrons.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nShe sought to remedy what she saw as a fundamental flaw of the Jedi Order: the lack of any mechanism to prevent Jedi from falling to the dark side, and repeatedly wreaking havoc on [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. To that end, she trained [[Handmaiden Sisters|a group of half-sisters]], specially equipped and trained to resist [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] and, if necessary, use their [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] combat skills to subdue wayward Jedi. Atris planned to eventually rebuild the Jedi Order, but she greatly overestimated her own ability to resist the dark side, becoming corrupted by delving into the forbidden knowledge of her collection of Sith holocrons.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\n====Reunion with Meetra Surik====\n{{Quote|I did not expect to see you again after the day of your sentencing. I thought you had taken the exile's path, wandering the galaxy. Yet you have returned - why?|Atris, to Meetra Surik|<ref name=\"TSL\" />}}\nIn [[3951 BBY]], Meetra Surik and her companions landed on Telos IV, having narrowly escaped the [[Skirmish at Peragus II|destruction]] of the [[Peragus Mining Facility]] at [[Peragus II]]. Upon hearing that the [[Telos Security Force]] held an individual called the Jedi Exile and her party under house arrest for their suspected involvement in the explosion of the mining facility, Atris desired to uncover the cause of the explosion, knowing that the consequences of its loss would be tremendous. Therefore, she sent one of her Handmaidens by the name of [[Brianna]], to steal their ship, the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', as well as [[T3-M4]] who, fortunately for her, was on board. The ship and droid were dissected for information, though little of value was actually found.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\n[[File:Atristrial.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A holorecord of Atris at the Jedi Exile's trial.]]\nUpon discovering the loss of her ship, Surik managed to [[Skirmish on Telos|trace]] the ''Ebon Hawk'' to the polar plateau where Atris's academy was hidden. Once she found her way inside, Atris had Surik's companions placed in [[force cage]]s while the Handmaidens brought Meetra Surik before her to be questioned. Not long before this, Atris had discovered Surik's identity, and was surprised at the revelation&mdash;she had not expected to see her again after the Council sentenced her to Exile.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nAt first she hoped that Surik had returned to admit that the Council had been right and to face up to her crimes, but that was not the case. Surik's presence stirred unpleasant feelings which Atris had all but forgotten, and hoped lost. These feelings showed themselves when she accused Meetra Surik of walking the dark path, when Atris' words were the ones that sounded bitter and resentful. In fact, she was so angry about what Surik did that she refused to believe that Surik had meant to help others in the Mandalorian Wars, and said she simply went off for the adventure and the excitement of battle. Atris continued to berate Surik by blaming her for the destruction of Peragus II. She was shocked to learn the Sith were behind it, and even more shocked when she learned the Sith were hunting Meetra Surik. She reluctantly accepted Surik's offer of help in defeating them, and instructed her to gather other Jedi on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] so that action could be taken and a Council could be had.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nAfter departing Telos IV, Surik discovered that T3-M4 had downloaded Atris's archives. It seemed that Atris had kept a holo record of her trial, as well as a list of the remaining [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]]&mdash;despite her claim that she was the \"last of the Jedi\" because T3 had been able to slice into the historian's files and copy them, locating the Jedi Masters for Atris's proposed meeting proved easier.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\n====Admission and letting go====\nAs Atris sought desperately to understand Surik's motives, which was part of the reason for her keeping of the [[Holocron/Legends|holocrons]], she clung even more desperately to her perfect view of the Jedi. However, in light of Surik's choices, she knew that either she or the Council was wrong. Though she placed Surik in the wrong, it only made her more unsettled, as, inwardly, she respected her choice. It built up a pressure that finally exploded when Kreia, who had then revealed her former identity as Darth Traya after she had killed the three Council members [[Zez-Kai Ell]], [[Kavar]], and [[Vrook Lamar]] when they reconvened on Dantooine, stripped Atris of her self-denials and allowed her to finally accepting that she was betrayed by her dark persona; Atris embraced herself as the second Darth Traya,<ref name=\"Admission\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', When Kreia speaks to Atris while in her meditation chamber.</ref> the Queen of Betrayal,<ref name=\"TSLOSG\">[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide|''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords'': Prima Official Game Guide]]</ref> and was told by Kreia that Meetra Surik would return to her sanctum on Telos to confront her for the last time.<ref name=\"Admission\" />\n\nAfter being informed by an Onderonian colonel named [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]] of the Jedi academy on Telos, who had been in turn informed by Kreia, Darth Nihilus attacked Telos, believing that he could feed on what Jedi were there.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nWhen Surik, who was searching for Kreia after having been left by the former Sith, returned to the Academy, Traya [[Duel in the Telosian Jedi Academy|clashed]] with her in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]], and was defeated. Surik, however, spared her life. This action was something Traya believed Surik would never have done, leading her to forgo the moniker of Darth Traya and let go of the Jedi; to be exiled from the Order to find her human self once more.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> Atris was held captive in her sanctum until judged by [[Mical]] and the new Jedi Council; the disciples of Meetra Surik.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Atris_KotORCG.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Atris, Jedi Master and Historian.]]\nAtris was extremely dedicated to the Jedi Order, and believed in their righteousness to the point of arrogance and fanaticism. She was impatient with dissenters, and took accusations against the Jedi very personally. When many Jedi left the order to follow Revan to war, Atris was eager to write them all off as traitors and Sith, even Meetra Surik after she returned to face the Council.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nDuring the Dark Wars, Atris became reclusive, and obsessed with preserving what she could of the Jedi legacy, including the Sith relics which would ultimately lead her down the path to the dark side. She was bitter and untrusting, surrounding herself with Echani warriors trained to resist the Force. Though she claimed to be building a Jedi Academy, she made no efforts to bring Force-sensitives to train. In fact, despite knowing the locations of the Jedi Masters Zez-Kai Ell, Vrook Lamar, Kavar, and [[Lonna Vash]], she made no attempt to contact them, and none of them knew that she was still alive.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nIt was ironic that despite the fact that Atris championed various causes, such as the limitation of the amount of Padawans a single Master could have,<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> or the fact that she attempted to preserve Jedi knowledge, she herself never took a Padawan.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nAtris wore an all-white variation of the traditional robes of a Jedi historian.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|All this collected knowledge, all these teachings of combat and the Force - they are mine to command.|Atris to the Jedi Exile|<ref name=\"TSL\" />}}\nAtris was a very powerful Jedi Master, using powers such as [[Force suppression]], [[Ionize|Droid Disable]], and [[Force Stasis/Legends|Force stun]]. After her fall to the dark side, she proved to be as proficient with dark-sided Force powers as well, including [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force choke]], [[Force drain/Legends|Force drain]], [[Mind trick/Legends|Force horror]], [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]], and [[Force Slow|Force affliction]].<ref name=\"TSL\" /> She was also a masterful lightsaber practitioner, using the deadly lightsaber form [[Form VII/Legends|Juyo]].<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\n\nHaving been a [[Jedi Watchman/Legends|Jedi Watchman]], Atris spoke and comprehended several languages, including [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], [[Sith (language)|Sith]], [[Old Galactic Standard]], and the Echani language. She was also an adept negotiator.<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Atris_4.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Concept artwork of Atris battling Darth Nihilus.]]\nAtris is voiced by [[Elizabeth Rider]]. However, [[Grey Griffin|Grey DeLisle]], who also voiced Brianna the Handmaiden, voices Atris during combat.<ref name=\"TSL\" /> Her concept art was drawn by [[Brian Menze]], who went on to create her in-game model as well.<ref name=\"DeviantArt\">{{DeviantArt|username=brenze|url=brenze/art/Atris-147113135|name=[[Brian Menze]]|text=Atris}}</ref>\n\n[[Lucasfilm]] maintains an internal image archive named \"Atris\"<ref name=\"Login\">{{WebCite|url=https://atris.media/login|text=Atris|work=[[Lucasfilm]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/XplOM}}</ref> for use in the company's productions.<ref name=\"Getty\">{{Getty|url=thewaltdisneystudios/allaccess/#!asset/wg4v96cg89hbxx5mfphv3g6|text=PDX-FF-001564|author=[[The Walt Disney Company|The Walt Disney Studios]]|date=2024-03-19|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/L5Z9Q}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Champions of the Force (Star Wars Miniatures)|''Champions of the Force'']] miniature set, the [[Jedi Guardian/Legends|Jedi Guardian]] figure resembles Atris,<ref name=\"SWM\">{{SWMiniCite|set=Champions of the Force|pack=Jedi Guardian}}</ref> though she is never identified as a Guardian at any time. In fact, she is classified as a [[Jedi Consular]] in the game files. In promotional material for ''The Sith Lords'', she is represented as the personification of the light side of the Force;<ref name=\"GS\">{{Gamespot|url=pc/rpg/kotor2/images.html?cat=31&mode=user|text=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Images|date=2005-02-07}}</ref> an analogue to Darth Nihilus, although the two never interact within the game. This is ironic, as Atris has embraced various levels of dark side corruption throughout the narrative.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nThough the ending where Atris is explicitly stated to have become Darth Traya was cut (see below), the ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide|Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]'' provides this information.<ref name=\"TSLOSG\" /> This is reinforced by the final version of the game, where Kreia says this to Atris, who had been overtaken and betrayed by the dark side: \"But there must always be a Darth Traya, one that holds the knowledge of betrayal. Who has been betrayed in their heart, and will betray in turn.\"<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nThere is an error in the ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide|Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]'', which shows a picture of Atris fighting Darth Nihilus in the black robes pictured above.,<ref name=\"TSLOSG\" /> which is explicitly stated in a cut version of ''The Sith Lords''. A misprint in ''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]'' on page 27 says the Handmaiden Brianna; the picture above is Atris and not Brianna.<ref name=\"UVG\">''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref>\n\n===Appearances===\nAtris' Jedi historian robes are very similar in design to [[Jocasta Nu/Legends|Jocasta Nu's]], another Jedi librarian; the difference being that Atris wears white,<ref name=\"TSL\" /> while Nu wears yellow and black.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones\">{{Film|II}}</ref>\n\n===Alternate choices===\nIf the Jedi Exile is set as a male, some discussion with the Echani Handmaiden [[Brianna]] reveals that Atris may have harbored feelings for the Exile, and the Exile's decision to leave the Jedi for the Mandalorian Wars was in fact the trigger for her eventual fall to the dark side. This further justifies the bitterness of her attitude when she first meets the Exile earlier in the game.<ref name=\"NCMV\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', Non-canon male version.</ref> In cut content, Atris openly confesses these feelings to the Sith holocrons shortly after the Exile leaves the academy.\n\nWith a male Exile, Atris privately orders Brianna to stow away on the ''Ebon Hawk'', presumably to spy on the Exile. And when the other five Handmaidens discover their sister missing, Atris lied to them, saying that Brianna had willingly left with the Exile for reasons that weren't known to her, making it seem that Brianna had voluntarily renounced her oath.<ref name=\"NCMV\" />\n\nIn addition to stopping Darth Traya and allowing Atris to choose to find her true self after their battle, the player has an opportunity to kill Atris, or to leave her at the mercy of the Sith holocrons.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\n[[File:DarthTrayatris.jpg|thumb|right|Atris's dark-robed model.]]\n\n===Cut content===\nThere is some indication that Atris was originally planned to be the player's party member at some point, most probably after Kreia's departure for [[Malachor V]]. For example, the name of her appearance set is \"Party_NPC_Atris\". An unused party member portrait for Atris is also present in the game files.<ref name=\"Dialogue\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', Dialogue files</ref> Furthermore, she is the most prominent figure in promotional material for the game, comparable to [[Bastila Shan]] in the first game. Bastila was a party member and played a major role in the plot,<ref name=\"KotOR\" /> whereas Atris' role is relatively small.<ref name=\"TSL\" />\n\nShould the [[Meetra Surik|Jedi Exile]] be a male, [[Brianna]] would not simply join the Exile out of belief that Atris may have been wrong but rather that Atris had personally sent her to watch the Exile and study him and to make sure that he does not contact the Sith.<ref name=\"Dialogue\" /> Originally, [[Mical]], also known as the Disciple, would not only be a spy for [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Carth Onasi]] or Admiral [[Cede]] but also for Atris. En route to Telos shortly after the Exile's confrontation with the Jedi Masters in the Jedi Enclave, the Disciple would contact Atris and inform her of the Sith's pending attack.\n\nWhen the Exile returned to Dantooine to confront the Jedi Masters at the rebuilt Jedi Enclave, a party member was to note Atris was not present at the meeting and ask why she was not there. This party member would then figure out that both Atris and Kreia had been corrupted by the dark side.\n\n[[File:Atrisportrait.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Atris's portrait from the game files.]]\nCut content from her dialog with Kreia indicates that Atris's fall involved Kreia making references to Telos, and how twice the choices of the Jedi had marked the planet for destruction, first by Revan as Telos was to host the Jedi and their lore in the avenue of a sudden attack, then by Darth Nihilus because Atris chose to hide there.\n\nDuring Atris' battle with the Exile, at some point, she would use the Exile's first lightsaber against her, claiming it is not hers to wield anymore.\n\nOriginally, the light side and dark side endings differed from each other more significantly than in the final game. One possible ending featured Kreia's redemption and Atris's total shift to the dark side, which culminated in the scene where Atris attacked the player wearing a black robe and claimed that she, not Kreia, was Darth Traya. Her dark side model remained in the PC version of the game and can appear in the main menu if the CurSithLord option is set to 1 in swkotor2.ini. An [[Wikipedia:Datel Action Replay|Action Replay]] mod is needed to view it on the Xbox. You may also use the model in the KOTOR/TSL Save Game Editor. If the KOTOR Save Editor is used, the code for her dark side model is Unique_Darth_Traya, indicating she was meant to become the new Darth Traya.\n\nLater on, the dark side model of Atris (see above) was planned to be put in the final game for the confrontation with Atris, but it was removed a few weeks before the game was released, with the reason that the presence of the dark side model was confusing the game testers.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Atris}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 9|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 9]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 29|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 29]]\n*''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]'' {{Ab|The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Cartel Market|''Star Wars: The Old Republic'' Cartel Market]] {{C|Outfit}}\n\n==Sources==\n*<!-- 2004-11-09 -->{{LucasArtsCite|url=games/swkotor_sithlords|text=''Chronicles of the Old Republic''|int=Chronicles of the Old Republic}} {{1stm}}\n*<!-- 2004-12-21 -->[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide|''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords'': Prima Official Game Guide]]\n*<!-- 2005-09-19 -->''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''\n*<!-- 2005-10-25 -->''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' {{ID|Darth Traya}}\n*<!-- 2007-11-27 -->[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*<!-- 2008-08-19 -->''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*<!-- 2008-12-09 -->''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*<!-- 2012-04-30 -->''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]'' {{Po}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{DeviantArt|username=brenze|url=brenze/art/Atris-147113135|name=[[Brian Menze]]|text=Atris}}\n*{{DeviantArt|username=brenze|url=brenze/art/Computer-Gaming-World-cover-147104950|name=[[Brian Menze]]|text=Computer Gaming World cover}}\n\n{{StartBox}}\n{{SuccessionBox\n|title=[[Chief Librarian/Legends|Chief Librarian]] of the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|Jedi Archives]]\n|years=[[3954 BBY]]&ndash;[[3951 BBY]]\n|before=Unknown\n|after=Eventually [[Ostar-Gal]]\n}}\n{{EndBox}}\n\n{{CouncilMandWar}}\n{{CouncilAMandWar}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|da=Atris\n|de=Atris#legends\n|es=Atris\n|fr=Atris\n|hu=Atris\n|pl=Atris\n|pt=Atris\n|py=\u042d\u0439\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0441\n|deFA=1\n}}\n\n[[Category:Darths]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Individuals with she/her pronouns]]\n[[Category:Jedi High Council members]]\n[[Category:Lore Keepers]]\n[[Category:Lost Jedi (Jedi Order)]]\n[[Category:Redeemed Jedi]]",

But Atris' faith in the righteousness of the Jedi wavered when her personal hero, Meetra Surik, turned her back on the Council to join rogue Knights Revan and Malak and their faction of Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars. Atris chose not to go to war, but this decision left her bitter and conflicted.\nWhen Surik returned to face the Councils judgment after the devastating events of the Battle of Malachor V, Atris was the first to condemn her, suggesting that she had fallen to the dark side just as Revan had. Over time, Atris grew to hate Surik for complicating her black-and-white view of the Jedi, the Sith, and the Force. During the Dark Wars, Atris called a secret Jedi convocation on the Miraluka world of Katarr in an attempt to find the threat that was stalking the Jedi. She then leaked knowledge of the conclaves existence in the hopes of drawing out the Sith. She succeeded, but with dire consequences; Darth Nihilus devastated the surface of the planet, wiping out all life on Katarr, including the Jedi gathered there.\nHowever, Atris survived, and she remained in seclusion, surrounding herself with Echani Handmaidens who could not feel the Force. She planned to rebuild the Jedi Order, and established a Jedi Academy in the old irrigation system on Telos IV. However, she was heavily influenced by the many Sith holocrons she had collected in her efforts to find and understand the Sith. The holocrons fed her bitterness, and she slowly and quietly fell to the dark side, consequently becoming Darth Traya, the Queen of Betrayal. Per the machinations of her mentor, Kreia, the first Darth Traya, Surik and the new Traya confronted each other once more on Telos, where Surik convinced Atris to turn away from the dark side. Atris then remained in the Jedi Academy, waiting to be judged for her actions by the new Jedi Council.\n\n\u2022 Biography\n\n\u2022 Early life\n\nAfter the end of the Great Sith War that was started by the Sith Lords Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma, the Jedi historian Atris attempted to revise the broken system of Jedi apprenticeship. She argued that there was little wonder why Kun and Qel-Droma fell to the dark side of the Force, when the Jedi had liberal instruction practices in place, such as dozens of Padawans training under a single Master, the radical bonds of reciprocal apprenticeship, and Jedi beginning their training in their teens and later. She invoked thousand-year old recommendations first suggested by the Jedi Master Simikarty, lobbying for the restriction of Padawans that a Master could have at one time, and also limiting the age of Jedi candidates.\nAtris also advocated prohibiting romantic involvement for Jedi, citing that the First Great Schism had been started by two lovers. She even endorsed adoption of a more austere interpretation of the Jedi Code which was favored by the Draethos Jedi Master Odan-Urr, in memory of his death at the hands of Exar Kun at the Jedi Academy on Ossus. Her arguments found powerful purchase amongst the Jedi, and she was appointed to High Council.\n\n\u2022 The Mandalorian Wars\n\nAtris, to Brianna\nWhen the Mandalorian Wars erupted in the year 3964 BBY, the Galactic Republic came to the Jedi for assistance. However, Atris resisted the call to protect the inhabitants of the Outer Rim Territories, instead staunchly defending the councils decision to meditate and reflect before taking action.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Exiles first visit to the Telosian Jedi Academy.\n.]]\nMany Jedi did not understand how the Council could sit idly while innocents died, and the order was split when two Jedi Knights named Revan and Malak chose to go to war. Many followed them, including the Jedi Meetra Surik. Atris had held a strong admiration for Surik, viewing her as something of a hero as well as a close friend. When she and Revan left the Order to join the war, rejecting everything that Atris believed in, Atris felt personally betrayed. Atris condemned Revan, his followers, and the \"freethinking\" teachings of his former Jedi Master, fellow historian Kreia. Revans eventual turn to the dark side came as little surprise to Atris. Indeed, when Revan met Atris years later asking what happened to Surik, Atris made little effort to conceal her contempt.The Old Republic: Revan'\nAfter the wars end, only one of the Jedi who had followed Revan to war returned to face the council: Meetra Surik. She stood before them as an echo in the Force, having cut herself off from it after the final battle at Malachor V. Surik was so defiant, so certain of the rightness of her actions that she caused Atris to doubt herself. Atris wanted to punish Surik for this, and became convinced that she had fallen to the dark side along with all of the others who had followed Revan. She felt that exile was too lenient of a punishment for Suriks betrayal, and believed that she would only join Revan again if she was free. The other Masters warned her to be mindful of her feelings, but Atris insisted that Surik ought to have died at Malachor V, because when she stood before them, it was if she was already dead. The Council decided not to tell Surik that she had become a wound in the Force, which was the result of her actions at Malachor.\nAtris kept Suriks lightsaber after the trial, carrying it with her always. Even many years later, she insisted that the Council was right to be cautious. But deep down, she continued to question the actions of the Council, Surik, and herself.\n\n\u2022 Search for the Exile\n\nAtris to Revan\nIn 3954 BBY, Revan came to the Temple Archives to find out what happened to his trusted General Meetra Surik. He accessed the file on Surik and found it lacking in information about her whereabouts. Behind him, Atris spoke out, during their conversation she revealed that Surik had disconnected herself from the Force because of the guilt she carried over her actions during the Mandalorian Wars. Although Revan felt responsible for Surik's fate, he refused to give her the satisfaction of seeing his guilt and grief. She stormed out of the room.\n\n\u2022 The Dark Wars\n\nKreia\nAfter the death of Darth Malak at the hands of a redeemed Revan,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic the Jedi Orders infrastructure was decimated. To make matters worse, some thing was systematically hunting and killing what Jedi there were left. Atris rallied a secret Jedi convocation on Katarr, a colony world of the Miraluka, where the threat could be assessed and the future of the Order discussed. However, Atris leaked knowledge of the session in hopes of drawing out this threat so that it could be fought. Unfortunately, she greatly underestimated its strength. The Sith arrived in the form of Darth Nihilus, who proved to be too powerful for the Jedi. Through the Force, he devoured all life on the planet, including the Jedi and Miraluka (with the single exception of Visas Marr, whom he later took as his apprentice). Atris, having not attended the Conclave, survived, along with a handful of other Masters who went into hiding.\nAtris took refuge under a polar ice cap on the planet Telos IV, where she began to build a secret Jedi academy in an old irrigation system. Here she hid most of the Jedi's most valuable artifacts and resources, including many Sith holocrons.\nShe sought to remedy what she saw as a fundamental flaw of the Jedi Order: the lack of any mechanism to prevent Jedi from falling to the dark side, and repeatedly wreaking havoc on the galaxy. To that end, she trained a group of half-sisters, specially equipped and trained to resist Force powers and, if necessary, use their Echani combat skills to subdue wayward Jedi. Atris planned to eventually rebuild the Jedi Order, but she greatly overestimated her own ability to resist the dark side, becoming corrupted by delving into the forbidden knowledge of her collection of Sith holocrons.\n\n\u2022 Reunion with Meetra Surik\n\nAtris, to Meetra Surik\nIn 3951 BBY, Meetra Surik and her companions landed on Telos IV, having narrowly escaped the destruction of the Peragus Mining Facility at Peragus II. Upon hearing that the Telos Security Force held an individual called the Jedi Exile and her party under house arrest for their suspected involvement in the explosion of the mining facility, Atris desired to uncover the cause of the explosion, knowing that the consequences of its loss would be tremendous. Therefore, she sent one of her Handmaidens by the name of Brianna, to steal their ship, the Ebon Hawk, as well as T3-M4 who, fortunately for her, was on board. The ship and droid were dissected for information, though little of value was actually found.\nUpon discovering the loss of her ship, Surik managed to trace the Ebon Hawk to the polar plateau where Atriss academy was hidden. Once she found her way inside, Atris had Suriks companions placed in force cages while the Handmaidens brought Meetra Surik before her to be questioned. Not long before this, Atris had discovered Surik's identity, and was surprised at the revelation&mdash;she had not expected to see her again after the Council sentenced her to Exile.\nAt first she hoped that Surik had returned to admit that the Council had been right and to face up to her crimes, but that was not the case. Suriks presence stirred unpleasant feelings which Atris had all but forgotten, and hoped lost. These feelings showed themselves when she accused Meetra Surik of walking the dark path, when Atris words were the ones that sounded bitter and resentful. In fact, she was so angry about what Surik did that she refused to believe that Surik had meant to help others in the Mandalorian Wars, and said she simply went off for the adventure and the excitement of battle. Atris continued to berate Surik by blaming her for the destruction of Peragus II. She was shocked to learn the Sith were behind it, and even more shocked when she learned the Sith were hunting Meetra Surik. She reluctantly accepted Surik's offer of help in defeating them, and instructed her to gather other Jedi on Dantooine so that action could be taken and a Council could be had.\nAfter departing Telos IV, Surik discovered that T3-M4 had downloaded Atriss archives. It seemed that Atris had kept a holo record of her trial, as well as a list of the remaining Jedi Masters&mdash;despite her claim that she was the \"last of the Jedi\" because T3 had been able to slice into the historians files and copy them, locating the Jedi Masters for Atris's proposed meeting proved easier.\n\n\u2022 Admission and letting go\n\nAs Atris sought desperately to understand Suriks motives, which was part of the reason for her keeping of the holocrons, she clung even more desperately to her perfect view of the Jedi. However, in light of Suriks choices, she knew that either she or the Council was wrong. Though she placed Surik in the wrong, it only made her more unsettled, as, inwardly, she respected her choice. It built up a pressure that finally exploded when Kreia, who had then revealed her former identity as Darth Traya after she had killed the three Council members Zez-Kai Ell, Kavar, and Vrook Lamar when they reconvened on Dantooine, stripped Atris of her self-denials and allowed her to finally accepting that she was betrayed by her dark persona; Atris embraced herself as the second Darth Traya,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, When Kreia speaks to Atris while in her meditation chamber. the Queen of Betrayal,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide and was told by Kreia that Meetra Surik would return to her sanctum on Telos to confront her for the last time.\nAfter being informed by an Onderonian colonel named Tobin of the Jedi academy on Telos, who had been in turn informed by Kreia, Darth Nihilus attacked Telos, believing that he could feed on what Jedi were there.\nWhen Surik, who was searching for Kreia after having been left by the former Sith, returned to the Academy, Traya clashed with her in a lightsaber duel, and was defeated. Surik, however, spared her life. This action was something Traya believed Surik would never have done, leading her to forgo the moniker of Darth Traya and let go of the Jedi; to be exiled from the Order to find her human self once more. Atris was held captive in her sanctum until judged by Mical and the new Jedi Council; the disciples of Meetra Surik.\n\n\u2022 Personality and traits\n\nAtris was extremely dedicated to the Jedi Order, and believed in their righteousness to the point of arrogance and fanaticism. She was impatient with dissenters, and took accusations against the Jedi very personally. When many Jedi left the order to follow Revan to war, Atris was eager to write them all off as traitors and Sith, even Meetra Surik after she returned to face the Council.\nDuring the Dark Wars, Atris became reclusive, and obsessed with preserving what she could of the Jedi legacy, including the Sith relics which would ultimately lead her down the path to the dark side. She was bitter and untrusting, surrounding herself with Echani warriors trained to resist the Force. Though she claimed to be building a Jedi Academy, she made no efforts to bring Force-sensitives to train. In fact, despite knowing the locations of the Jedi Masters Zez-Kai Ell, Vrook Lamar, Kavar, and Lonna Vash, she made no attempt to contact them, and none of them knew that she was still alive.\nIt was ironic that despite the fact that Atris championed various causes, such as the limitation of the amount of Padawans a single Master could have, or the fact that she attempted to preserve Jedi knowledge, she herself never took a Padawan.\nAtris wore an all-white variation of the traditional robes of a Jedi historian.\n\n\u2022 Powers and abilities\n\nAtris to the Jedi Exile\nAtris was a very powerful Jedi Master, using powers such as Force suppression, Droid Disable, and Force stun. After her fall to the dark side, she proved to be as proficient with dark-sided Force powers as well, including Force choke, Force drain, Force horror, Force lightning, and Force affliction. She was also a masterful lightsaber practitioner, using the deadly lightsaber form Juyo.\nHaving been a Jedi Watchman, Atris spoke and comprehended several languages, including Basic, Sith, Old Galactic Standard, and the Echani language. She was also an adept negotiator.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nAtris is voiced by Elizabeth Rider. However, Grey DeLisle, who also voiced Brianna the Handmaiden, voices Atris during combat. Her concept art was drawn by Brian Menze, who went on to create her in-game model as well.\nLucasfilm maintains an internal image archive named \"Atris\" for use in the company's productions.The Walt Disney Studios]]\nIn the Champions of the Force miniature set, the Jedi Guardian figure resembles Atris, though she is never identified as a Guardian at any time. In fact, she is classified as a Jedi Consular in the game files. In promotional material for The Sith Lords, she is represented as the personification of the light side of the Force; an analogue to Darth Nihilus, although the two never interact within the game. This is ironic, as Atris has embraced various levels of dark side corruption throughout the narrative.\nThough the ending where Atris is explicitly stated to have become Darth Traya was cut (see below), the Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide provides this information. This is reinforced by the final version of the game, where Kreia says this to Atris, who had been overtaken and betrayed by the dark side: \"But there must always be a Darth Traya, one that holds the knowledge of betrayal. Who has been betrayed in their heart, and will betray in turn.\"\nThere is an error in the Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide, which shows a picture of Atris fighting Darth Nihilus in the black robes pictured above., which is explicitly stated in a cut version of The Sith Lords. A misprint in Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide on page 27 says the Handmaiden Brianna; the picture above is Atris and not Brianna.Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nAtris Jedi historian robes are very similar in design to Jocasta Nus, another Jedi librarian; the difference being that Atris wears white, while Nu wears yellow and black.II\n\n\u2022 Alternate choices\n\nIf the Jedi Exile is set as a male, some discussion with the Echani Handmaiden Brianna reveals that Atris may have harbored feelings for the Exile, and the Exiles decision to leave the Jedi for the Mandalorian Wars was in fact the trigger for her eventual fall to the dark side. This further justifies the bitterness of her attitude when she first meets the Exile earlier in the game.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords', Non-canon male version. In cut content, Atris openly confesses these feelings to the Sith holocrons shortly after the Exile leaves the academy.\nWith a male Exile, Atris privately orders Brianna to stow away on the Ebon Hawk, presumably to spy on the Exile. And when the other five Handmaidens discover their sister missing, Atris lied to them, saying that Brianna had willingly left with the Exile for reasons that weren't known to her, making it seem that Brianna had voluntarily renounced her oath.\nIn addition to stopping Darth Traya and allowing Atris to choose to find her true self after their battle, the player has an opportunity to kill Atris, or to leave her at the mercy of the Sith holocrons.\n\n\u2022 Cut content\n\nThere is some indication that Atris was originally planned to be the players party member at some point, most probably after Kreias departure for Malachor V. For example, the name of her appearance set is \"Party_NPC_Atris\". An unused party member portrait for Atris is also present in the game files.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Dialogue files Furthermore, she is the most prominent figure in promotional material for the game, comparable to Bastila Shan in the first game. Bastila was a party member and played a major role in the plot, whereas Atris' role is relatively small.\nShould the Jedi Exile be a male, Brianna would not simply join the Exile out of belief that Atris may have been wrong but rather that Atris had personally sent her to watch the Exile and study him and to make sure that he does not contact the Sith. Originally, Mical, also known as the Disciple, would not only be a spy for Admiral Carth Onasi or Admiral Cede but also for Atris. En route to Telos shortly after the Exiles confrontation with the Jedi Masters in the Jedi Enclave, the Disciple would contact Atris and inform her of the Siths pending attack.\nWhen the Exile returned to Dantooine to confront the Jedi Masters at the rebuilt Jedi Enclave, a party member was to note Atris was not present at the meeting and ask why she was not there. This party member would then figure out that both Atris and Kreia had been corrupted by the dark side.\nCut content from her dialog with Kreia indicates that Atris's fall involved Kreia making references to Telos, and how twice the choices of the Jedi had marked the planet for destruction, first by Revan as Telos was to host the Jedi and their lore in the avenue of a sudden attack, then by Darth Nihilus because Atris chose to hide there.\nDuring Atris battle with the Exile, at some point, she would use the Exiles first lightsaber against her, claiming it is not hers to wield anymore.\nOriginally, the light side and dark side endings differed from each other more significantly than in the final game. One possible ending featured Kreias redemption and Atriss total shift to the dark side, which culminated in the scene where Atris attacked the player wearing a black robe and claimed that she, not Kreia, was Darth Traya. Her dark side model remained in the PC version of the game and can appear in the main menu if the CurSithLord option is set to 1 in swkotor2.ini. An Action Replay mod is needed to view it on the Xbox. You may also use the model in the KOTOR/TSL Save Game Editor. If the KOTOR Save Editor is used, the code for her dark side model is Unique_Darth_Traya, indicating she was meant to become the new Darth Traya.\nLater on, the dark side model of Atris (see above) was planned to be put in the final game for the confrontation with Atris, but it was removed a few weeks before the game was released, with the reason that the presence of the dark side model was confusing the game testers.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Knights of the Old Republic 9\n\n\u2022 Knights of the Old Republic 29\n\n\u2022 The Old Republic: Revan The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Old Republic\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Old Republic Cartel Market Outfit\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide\n\n\u2022 The New Essential Chronology Darth Traya\n\n\u2022 Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\n\n\u2022 Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide\n\n\u2022 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nJedi Archives]]",

The original game, however, was developed by a different company, [[BioWare]].

BioWare is understood to have recommended [[Obsidian Entertainment]] as an alternative developer, having worked with many of Obsidian's key members when they were part of the now-defunct [[Wikipedia:Black Isle Studios|Black Isle Studios]].

With 3C-FD's help, T3-M4 manages to dock the ship into the [[Peragus Mining Facility]], where Surik is put into a [[kolto tank]] in the medical bay, while Kreia, assumed to be dead, is placed in the morgue.\n\nAfter regaining consciousness, Surik finds Kreia, who wakes up from her trance. She explores her surroundings and finds a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], [[Atton Rand]], whom she frees from a [[force cage]]. The three of them seem to be the only persons alive in the entire facility, which is covered with dead miners and crawling with assault-programmed [[Mining droid/Legends|mining droids]] that are \"mining\" organics. Surik eventually learns that the HK-50 assassin droid is after her because of a bounty placed by the [[Exchange]] on living Jedi since the [[First Jedi Purge|collapse of the Jedi Order]]. The HK-50 assassin droid, which claims responsibility for all the deaths and damage at the facility, tries to stop Surik from leaving but she destroys it.\n\nIn the meantime, another ship arrives at Peragus: the [[Harbinger (Hammerhead-class)|''Harbinger'']], the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] capital ship transporting Surik to [[Telos IV]] before they ended up at Peragus. When Surik, Kreia, and Rand&mdash;in an attempt to escape from Peragus&mdash;board the ''Harbinger'', they discover that the ship has been overrun by the [[Sith Triumvirate|Sith]] under [[Darth Sion]]. As Kreia approaches the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] in an attempt to distract him, Surik and Rand escape through one of the ship's fuel lines.\n\nMeanwhile, when Sion cuts off Kreia's hand with [[Darth Sion's lightsaber|his lightsaber]], Surik discovers her newly formed [[Force-bond/Legends|Force bond]] with Kreia when she unexpectedly feels Kreia's pain through the Force. Surik and Rand continue moving and meet up with T3-M4, which has been disabled earlier by the HK-50 assassin droid. Upon reaching the hangar bay, they board the ''Ebon Hawk'' and fend off attacks from [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith troopers]]. Kreia, who has managed to escape from Sion, catches up with them and gets on board too. As they fly into an [[asteroid field]] surrounding [[Peragus II]], the ''Harbinger'' fires at the ''Ebon Hawk'' but misses and hits one of the asteroids, triggering a series of explosions which completely destroy the mining facility, asteroid field, and the Peragus system itself.\n\n====Refuge on Telos====\n[[File:CitadelStation.jpg|thumb|right|Telos [[Citadel Station]].]]\nUsing the [[Star map/Legends|astrogation charts]] recovered from the ''Harbinger'', Surik and her companions make their way to [[Citadel Station]], the space station orbiting the war-ravaged [[Telos system|Telos]] system. Upon their arrival, they are immediately disarmed and detained by the [[Telos Security Force]] under Lieutenant [[Dol Grenn]] for their apparent involvement in the destruction of Peragus&mdash;not coincidentally, the main fuel supplier for Citadel Station, without which the station cannot maintain its orbit around Telos. During the investigation, [[Brianna|a mysterious woman]] steals the ''Ebon Hawk'' with T3-M4 on board.\n\n[[Chodo Habat]], the leader of the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] herd responsible for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] restoration efforts on Telos, offers to help Surik restore her lost connection to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] in exchange for dealing with their rival, [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]]. Despite Kreia's disapproval, Surik accepts Habat's offer and protects the Ithorians' interests from Czerka and the [[Exchange]]. In return, the Ithorians also provide her a shuttle to fly to the surface of Telos IV.\n\n[[File:FrolickingPuppy-KOTOR2.png|thumb|left|The surface of [[Telos IV]], undergoing [[Telosian Restoration Project|restoration]] after the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] [[Bombing of Telos IV|bombardment]].]]\nEn route to the restoration zone on the surface, their shuttle is shot down by a Czerka air defense turret. Surik and her companions manage to crash-land near the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] mechanic [[Bao-Dur]], who served under Surik during the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. He has been working with the Ithorians to restore Telos IV after the wars.\n\nBao-Dur joins Surik and her companions and leads them to an abandoned Republic military base. Along the way, they fight some Czerka [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] and [[cannok]]s. Once they are at the base, Bao-Dur points out a breach in the planetary defense system in the polar regions as the most likely location of the ''Ebon Hawk''. Surik and her companions then board another shuttle from the base to the polar regions.\n\n====Hidden Academy====\n[[File:Telos_polar.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Hidden Academy]] on Telos.]]\nThe shuttle crash-lands on a polar plateau after being shot down by three [[HK-50 series assassin droid|HK-50 assassin droids]]. After destroying the droids, Surik discovers a [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi academy]] hidden beneath the plateau.\n\nUpon entering, they are surrounded by the [[Handmaiden Sisters]], who disarm and arrest them. Surik is brought before [[Atris]], one of the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] who previously exiled her from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] for defying the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council's]] order to stay out of the Mandalorian Wars. Surik offers to help Atris deal with the [[Sith Triumvirate|new Sith threat]] and find any surviving Jedi. Impressed that Surik holds no grudge against her, Atris allows Surik to take back the ''Ebon Hawk'' and leave with her companions.\n\nWhen the group assembles again on the ''Ebon Hawk'', T3-M4 informs Surik that it has secretly downloaded a [[Holorecorder/Legends|holorecord]] of [[Trial of Meetra Surik|her trial]] from Atris' archives. It turns out that there are four Jedi Masters in hiding\u2014[[Zez-Kai Ell]], [[Kavar]], [[Vrook Lamar]], and [[Lonna Vash]]. She decides to find them to discuss a plan of action against the Sith and figure out why she has lost her connection to the Force.\n\n====Nar Shaddaa====\n[[File:Narshaddaa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' on Nar Shaddaa.]]\nTheir first stop is [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], a moon of [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. The massive population and large cityscape of the moon makes it easy for anyone to hide and lay low for a while. In her attempt to find Jedi Master [[Zez-Kai Ell]], Surik actively provokes the [[Exchange]] by helping the refugees in the [[Refugee Sector]] who are being exploited by the Exchange. She and her companions also fend off some Jedi-hunting [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] and ''[[Red Eclipse]]'' [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]]. At one point, Surik is ambushed by [[Visas Marr]], a [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] assassin working for the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Nihilus]]. After defeating Marr, she shows kindness toward Marr, who, in return, pledges allegiance to Surik.\n\nAfter Surik is lured into a trap in the [[Jekk'Jekk Tarr]] and captured by the Exchange boss [[G0-T0|Goto]], the bounty hunter [[Mira]] teams up with Surik's companions to infiltrate [[Visionary|Goto's yacht]] and rescue her. During their escape, Surik and her companions sabotage the yacht's [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]] and expose its position. Goto's rivals and [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] forces seize the opportunity to attack and destroy the yacht, while Surik and her companions escape on the ''Ebon Hawk''. Goto apparently survives and orders his droid, G0-T0, to join Surik's team. Surik later deduces that \"Goto\" is actually a hologram constructed by G0-T0 to mask its true identity as a [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[G0-T0 infrastructure planning system|planning droid]] which has gone rogue.\n\nAfter returning to Nar Shaddaa, Surik meets Zez-Kai Ell, who answers her questions and teaches her a new lightsaber form or new Force power. He also agrees to go to the former [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] and wait there while Surik continues searching for the other Jedi Masters.\n\n====Dxun====\nAfter leaving Nar Shaddaa, Surik seeks Jedi Master [[Kavar]] on [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]]. As the ''Ebon Hawk'' enters the [[Japrael system/Legends|Onderon system]] and joins the long queue into the [[Iziz Starport|starport]] on Onderon's capital [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], Onderon starfighters under Colonel [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]] open fire at the ''Ebon Hawk'' and start a space battle above Iziz. The ''Ebon Hawk'' suffers heavy damage during the battle and is forced to land on [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], one of Onderon's moons.\n\nWhile exploring Dxun in search of a way out, Surik discovers a covert [[Mandalorian Outpost (Dxun)|Mandalorian camp]] deep in the jungle and encounters [[Canderous Ordo]], who has claimed the title of [[Mandalore (title)/Legends|Mandalore]] and currently seeks to unite the scattered Mandalorian clans under his leadership. Ordo promises to provide Surik passage to Iziz if she impresses him and his Mandalorian followers. After performing a number of feats, Surik gains the Mandalorians' trust and respect. Just as Surik is about to leave for Iziz with Ordo on his personal shuttle, the camp comes under attack by [[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassins]], who are swiftly dealt with by Surik and the Mandalorians.\n\n====Iziz====\n[[File:Izizconc.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Iziz/Legends|The walled city of Iziz]].]]\nOnce Surik arrives in Iziz, she becomes aware of an ongoing political crisis in the capital. General [[Vaklu]] has declared martial law and has been rallying support for a coup against his cousin, Queen [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]]. There are also many people demanding that Onderon secedes from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]. The Onderon armed forces have also split into two factions, with one side championing Vaklu and the other side remaining loyal to the Queen. Although Ordo wants Surik to support Vaklu in the power struggle, Surik is more inclined to side with Queen Talia. In the midst of all the political unrest, Surik tracks down Ordo's contact in Iziz, [[Dhagon Ghent]], and learns that he has been arrested as a suspect for the murder of Captain [[Sullio]]. After Surik helps Ghent clear his name, he arranges for her to meet Jedi Master Kavar, who has been secretly serving as an adviser to the Queen.\n\nSurik and Kavar's meeting at the cantina is cut short when Colonel Tobin and his soldiers show up to capture Kavar. Before fleeing the cantina, Kavar uses [[Force Stasis/Legends|Force Stasis]] to stun Tobin's soldiers and tells Surik that he will contact her later. While Tobin goes off in pursuit of the Jedi Master, Surik and her companions make their way out of Iziz and fight Vaklu's men who try to kill them.\n\n====Dantooine====\n[[File:Dantooineenclave.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] [[Jedi Enclave|Enclave]] Sublevel.]]\nSurik leaves Dxun on the repaired ''Ebon Hawk'' and travels to the grassland planet of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], which is still recovering from the [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|Sith attack]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]]. The surviving populace have established [[Khoonda]], a makeshift government based in the former [[Matale family|Matale]] [[Matale estate|residence]], under the leadership of their [[Administrator/Legends|Administrator]], [[Terena Adare]]. Due to the damage caused by the Jedi Civil War, many people on Dantooine are suspicious and distrustful of the Jedi, or simply any lightsaber-wielding person.\n\nConcealing her Jedi identity, Surik interacts with the local settlers and hears rumors that Adare had met a Jedi. Adare later reveals to Surik that she is in contact with Jedi Master [[Vrook Lamar]] because she needs his help to protect the settlers; the [[Khoonda Militia]] is too small and weak to resist aggression from [[Azkul's mercenaries|a group of mercenaries]]. Adare also grants Surik permission to search the ruins of the Jedi Enclave.\n\nAfter fighting several [[laigrek]]s in the Enclave sublevel, Surik encounters [[Mical]], a former [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Jedi Initiate]] whose training had been disrupted by the Mandalorian Wars. Now a [[Historian/Legends|historian]] and soldier in the service of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], Mical has been sent by Admiral [[Carth Onasi]] to protect any [[Jedi artifact/Legends|Jedi artifacts]] he can find in the ruins. Mical becomes one of Surik's companions. Surik discovers a datapad in the library which shows that Lamar has been captured by the mercenaries and is being held captive in the [[Crystal Cave (Dantooine)|crystal cave]].\n\nSurik goes to the cave and tries to save Lamar by fighting the mercenaries, but the Jedi Master reprimands her for acting on impulse. It turns out that he had deliberately allowed himself to be captured so that he can find out how the mercenaries are planning to attack Khoonda; Surik's \"rescue\" had complicated matters. Just as Surik exits the cave, she meets [[Azkul]], the mercenary leader, who asks her to help them in conquering Khoonda. Surik refuses and fights her way back to Khoonda.\n\nAt Khoonda, Surik strengthens the stronghold's defenses by activating droids and security systems, as well as recruiting more people to join the Khoonda Militia, in preparation for an impending attack by the mercenaries. The [[Battle of Khoonda]] ultimately ends with the settlers' victory. After the battle, Lamar answers Surik's questions and teaches her a new lightsaber form or new Force power. Through her courageous deeds, Surik not only gains the gratitude of the people of Dantooine, but also restores their faith in the Jedi.\n\n====Return to Dxun====\nAfter Surik leaves Dantooine, she receives word from the Mandalorians on Dxun that Jedi Master Kavar has made contact and wants her to meet him in Iziz. On the same day, General Vaklu denounces Queen Talia as a traitor and declares war against her. Thus begins the [[Onderon Civil War]].\n\nThe [[Sith Triumvirate|Sith]], who have joined the civil war on Vaklu's side, are using the [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|tomb]] of [[Freedon Nadd]] on Dxun as their base of operations. Surik's companions join forces with the Mandalorians to launch an attack on the Sith at the tomb and manage to defeat them.\n\n====Return to Iziz====\nIn the meantime, Surik flies on a salvaged [[Basilisk war droid/Legends|Basilisk war droid]] into Iziz and participates in the civil war. With support from forces loyal to Queen Talia, she fights her way up the [[Sky Ramp]] and into the [[Iziz Royal Palace|Royal Palace]]. In the palace, she teams up with Kavar and the loyalists to defeat Vaklu's forces and their Sith allies. In the throne room, Surik assists Queen Talia in a duel against Vaklu and defeats him; Vaklu is captured and his fate will be decided by the Queen. This marks the end of the civil war.\n\nAfter the battle, Kavar answers Surik's questions and teaches her a new lightsaber form or new Force power. Then, he leaves for the former [[Jedi Enclave]] on Dantooine, where all the missing Jedi Masters are to be reunited. In the meantime, Kreia secretly revives Colonel Tobin, who has been knocked unconscious during the battle, and orders him to deliver a message to [[Darth Nihilus]] to go to [[Telos IV]].\n\n====Korriban====\nSurik's final stop during her search for the missing Jedi Masters is the Sith homeworld of [[Korriban/Legends|Korriban]]. While exploring the ruins of the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]] at the [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|Valley of the Dark Lords]], Surik finds the dead body of the last missing Jedi Master, [[Lonna Vash]]. She also encounters [[Darth Sion]], and briefly duels him until Kreia telepathically advises her to escape. Surik then explores the [[shyrack cave]] and enters the [[Tomb of Ludo Kressh|tomb]] of [[Ludo Kressh]]. In the tomb, she experiences visions of her past, her companions and [[Revan]], and gains a deeper understanding of the Force.\n\n====Eyes of the Exile====\nThroughout her journey across the galaxy, Surik regains her connection to the Force and, under Kreia's guidance, starts her journey toward becoming a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]]. She also learns much about her companions' backstories. After discovering that Rand, Bao-Dur, Mira, and Mical are [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], she trains them to eventually form a new generation of Jedi, whom Kreia refers to as the [[Lost Jedi]]&mdash;the true Jedi&mdash;disciples of Surik who will later form the basis of a new Jedi Order. Surik also learns from Kreia that [[Revan]] was Kreia's [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] at one point in time, and that he has gone to the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] to counter an unseen threat from beyond the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]].\n\nWhen the three surviving Jedi Masters&mdash;Zez-Kai Ell, Kavar, and Vrook&mdash;finally gather at the rebuilt [[Jedi Enclave]] on Dantooine, Surik learns from them that the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] did not cut off her connection to the Force. In fact, she did so herself when she created a [[Wound in the Force/Legends|wound in the Force]] by activating the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] during the [[Battle of Malachor V]]; the trauma of sensing so many deaths through the Force caused her to instinctively sever her connection to the Force.\n\nAfter Surik fails to persuade the Jedi Masters to unite against the Sith, they explain that the [[Sith Triumvirate|new Sith threat]], in the form of [[Darth Nihilus]], had caught them off guard. As Nihilus feeds on the Force, he causes widespread death and destruction to worlds which have a strong connection to the Force. That was what happened during the [[Conclave at Katarr|Jedi conclave]] at [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]] when Nihilus showed up and destroyed all the the Jedi who were present, along with the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Miraluka]] species by [[Force drain/Legends|draining the Force]] from the planet, although the Miraluka Visas Marr survived.\n\nThe Jedi Masters conclude that Surik has regained her connection to the Force by feeding on the life energy of her companions through her ability to form [[Force-bond/Legends|Force bonds]] with them. As they are worried that the Exile will, through the Force, lead the Sith to them and eventually cause the [[death of the Force]], they want to strip her of her connection to the Force against her will.\n\nAt that moment, Kreia appears, berates the Jedi Masters for their arrogance and ignorance, and uses an extreme form of Force drain to make them undergo the same loss Surik felt at Malachor V. Unable to live without the Force, the three Jedi Masters die almost immediately. Although Surik retains her connection to the Force, she becomes unconscious. In the meantime, the [[Handmaiden Sisters]] dash into the Enclave and take Kreia prisoner before delivering her to their mistress, [[Atris]].\n\n====Admission of Atris====\nWhen Surik regains consciousness, she finds out from her companions about what had happened, and returns to the [[Telosian Jedi Academy|Jedi academy]] on Telos IV to find Kreia. She figures out that the Force bond between her and Kreia is lethal; this meant that if Kreia dies, Surik will die as well.\n\nIn the meantime, Kreia reveals to Atris that she has fallen to the dark side and become Darth Traya. The irony is that Atris, in her attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order and prevent any future Jedi from falling to the ways of the Sith, has been corrupted by her studies of the ways of the Sith. After Kreia exposes her, Atris fully embraces her persona of Darth Traya and admits her fall to darkness. Kreia then leaves.\n\nShortly after, Surik shows up to confront the fallen Jedi Master and defeats her. However, against Atris's expectations, Surik does not kill her and spares her life instead. Realizing that perhaps she can find her true self if she will simply let go of her flawed ideas about the Jedi, Atris awaits judgement at her sanctum of [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]] within the Telos academy. She also tells Surik that the Sith are about to attack Telos, and that Kreia has left for Malachor V, where she will wait for the Exile to finish what she has begun there.\n\n====The Battle of Telos====\n{{Main|Battle of Telos IV}}\n[[File:Nihilusbridge_conf.jpg|thumb|right|The bridge of the ''Ravager'']]\nWhen Surik arrives at [[Citadel Station]], she sees that the [[Battle of Telos IV|Sith attack]] has already begun. Along with the [[Telos Security Force]] and reinforcements from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], Dantooine and Onderon, Surik and her companions fight the Sith and clear the station of enemy forces.\n\nSurik then teams up with Marr, Ordo and the Mandalorians to board an orbital shuttle and infiltrate Darth Nihilus's ship, the [[Ravager (Centurion-class)|''Ravager'']]. Once on board, they plant [[Proton bomb/Legends|proton charges]] on the ship and head to the bridge to confront the Sith Lord.\n\nDuring their duel, Nihilus attempts to [[Force drain/Legends|drain the Force]] from Surik in the same way he did to other Jedi, but it proves to be his undoing\u2014instead of feeding on Surik's connection to the Force, he is weakened by the echoes of the [[Wound in the Force/Legends|wound in the Force]] that she carries with her. With Marr helping to distract the Sith Lord, Surik ultimately defeats Nihilus and claims his [[Mask of Darth Nihilus|mask]]. Surik and her companions then escape from the ''Ravager'' just before it blows up. The remaining Sith forces either flee or are destroyed, thus bringing an end to the battle.\n\nUpon Surik's return to Citadel Station, Admiral [[Carth Onasi]] has a private meeting with her, during which he relates to her the story of [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|how he met Revan]], and enlists her help in finding Revan in the Unknown Regions. After Surik leaves, Onasi meets [[Bastila Shan]] and talks to her about Revan.\n\n====Exile of the echoes====\n{{See_also|Battle of Malachor}}\n[[File:TrayusCore.jpg|thumb|left|The Trayus Core, part of the Trayus Academy and the location of the final confrontation between Meetra Surik and Kreia.]]\nSurik and her companions travel to [[Malachor V]], where the war-torn planet's unstable environment causes the ''Ebon Hawk'' to crash. Surik navigates her way on foot across the planet's inhospitable landscape and reaches the [[Trayus Academy]].\n\nIn the Trayus Academy, Surik defeats the [[Sith Triumvirate|Sith forces]] and duels [[Darth Sion]]. Despite the Sith Lord's regenerative abilities, Surik convinces him to let go of his pain and willingly accept death, thus ending his immortality.\n\nSurik then confronts Kreia in the [[Trayus Core]]. Kreia refuses redemption and forces Surik to either kill her, to let go of the echoes of Malachor V, or be killed and allow death to consume the galaxy. Kreia is ultimately defeated by the Exile.\n\nUpon her defeat, Kreia gazes into the future, revealing the future of Surik's companions, of the planets they had visited, of the Mandalorians, and of the Republic. She also says that Revan came to Malachor V after the Mandalorian Wars and again after the Jedi Civil War, and that he has discovered evidence of the \"[[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|True Sith]],\" whom he has gone to fight \"in his own way.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Malachor V's surface, [[Bao-Dur's remote]] powers up and reactivates the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] despite G0-T0's attempt to stop it. As Malachor V collapses upon itself once again, the ''Ebon Hawk'' arrives in time to save Surik while Kreia plunges to her death in the Trayus Core. Surik then heads off to the Unknown Regions in search of Revan.\n\n==Major characters==\n{{Expand|1}}\nThis is based on the [[canon]]ical [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] version of the game.\n\n{{GameLS}}\n===Meetra Surik===\n{{Main|Meetra Surik}}\n[[File:Meetra_Surik.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Meetra Surik]]\n'''Meetra Surik''' (also known as the '''Jedi Exile''') is the protagonist of ''Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords''. Ten years before the events of the story, Surik fought as a [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] alongside [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] during the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. At the climactic [[Battle of Malachor V]], she activated the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]], which caused over a thousand instantaneous deaths. Although this event ended the war, the trauma of sensing so many deaths through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] caused Surik to instinctively sever her connection to the Force, and she was subsequently banished from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. After wandering the periphery of the galaxy for a decade, Surik is drawn into the [[First Jedi Purge|conflict]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] and the [[Sith Triumvirate|Sith]]. Gathering companions and healing the dying Jedi Order in her journey, Surik ultimately eliminates the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lords]] of the Sith Triumvirate, encountering the shadows of her past along the way and conquering her inner demons. She eventually defeats Kreia in the [[Trayus Core]] on [[Malachor V]], thus ending the threat she posed.\n\n===Darth Sion===\n{{Main|Darth Sion}}\n[[File:Darthsionheadshot.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Darth Sion]]\n'''Darth Sion''' (also known as the '''Lord of Pain''') is one of the three [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] of the [[Sith Triumvirate]]. Formerly a warrior serving under [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], he was killed in battle during the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]]. However, he resurrected himself by harnessing his hatred through the Force, thereby allowing him to rise from the [[Death/Legends|dead]] whenever he is defeated. His [[Immortality/Legends|immortality]] comes at a great cost, however, because his wounds never heal and he constantly suffers from pain. During the [[Jedi Civil War]], Sion sided with the Sith against the Republic and formed the Sith Triumvirate with Darth Traya. However, he betrayed Traya when he believed that she was growing too weak for the Sith, and led his forces on [[First Jedi Purge|a five-year long extermination of the Jedi]]. When Meetra Surik returns to the galaxy after ten years of absence, Sion becomes obsessed with hunting her down. She evades him during each encounter. Eventually, Surik confronts Sion in the [[Trayus Academy]] on [[Malachor V]], where she overcomes the Sith Lord and convinces him to abandon his hatred and willingly accept his death. Sion might have also died willingly as to end his pain.\n\n===Darth Nihilus===\n{{Main|Darth Nihilus}}\n[[File:KOTOR2Nihilus.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Darth Nihilus]]\n'''Darth Nihilus''' (also known as the '''Lord of Hunger''') is one of the three [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] of the [[Sith Triumvirate]]. His past life is almost completely shrouded in mystery, apart from the fact that he was a former Jedi who fought under Revan during the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. During the catastrophic end of the [[Battle of Malachor V]], the man who became Nihilus miraculously survived Meetra Surik's activation of the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]], though the experience left him scarred. The strain of sensing so many deaths through the Force caused Nihilus to crave [[Force energy]], and he kept himself alive on the dead planet by draining the Force from whatever vessel he came across. This misuse of Force power caused his physical form to degenerate until he had to encase his spirit inside his [[Mask of Darth Nihilus|mask]] and armor in order to stay alive. He was eventually found by Darth Traya, who trained him and Darth Sion as her apprentices. The Sith Triumvirate then led [[First Jedi Purge|a five-year long galactic extermination of the Jedi]]. Nihilus later aided Sion in overthrowing Traya, and then detached himself from Sion, causing major destruction and taking on an [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] of his own, Visas Marr. Nihilus is later lured to [[Telos IV]] by Kreia, the former Darth Traya, under the pretense that there are Jedi on the planet for him to consume. He is drawn into [[Battle of Telos IV|a confrontation]] with Meetra Surik and a redeemed Marr, who fight him on board the [[Ravager (Centurion-class)|''Ravager'']] and eventually slay him.\n\n===Kreia===\n{{Main|Kreia}}\n[[File:Kreia.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Kreia]]\n'''Kreia''' is a mysterious old woman whom Meetra Surik meets in the [[Peragus Mining Facility]] after eluding Darth Sion and his [[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassins]]. A powerful [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force sensitive]], Kreia serves as Surik's mentor through her journey to restore order to the Republic, helping her reestablish her connection to the Force. While her motives are initially shrouded in mystery, Surik gradually learns of Kreia's origins as Revan's original master. She was blamed for Revan's fall after the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and banished from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] as punishment. Turning to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], Kreia became '''Darth Traya''', took control of the remnants of [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire]], and formed the [[Sith Triumvirate]]. Before she could take revenge against the Jedi, Kreia was betrayed by her two apprentices, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus, who cut off her connection to the Force. Kreia then takes Surik as her new apprentice, seeing her potential as a [[Wound in the Force/Legends|wound in the Force]] to remove the influence of the will of the Force from [[Sentience/Legends|sentients]], allowing individuals to let go of their instinctual dependency on the higher power and be themselves. Her plan succeeds when she is killed by Meetra Surik in the [[Trayus Core]] on [[Malachor V]]&mdash;the Jedi Exile has let her bond to Kreia die, and is freed from the tragedy of Malachor V that echoed throughout her journey thereafter.\n\n===Atton Rand===\n{{Main|Atton Rand}}\n[[File:Attonrender.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Atton Rand]]\n'''Atton Rand''' is a former [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] soldier who served under [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] during the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and [[Jedi Civil War]]. After the wars, he became a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]]. At one point in time, he was captured and imprisoned in the [[Peragus Mining Facility]] until Meetra Surik frees him. After escaping from Peragus on the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', Rand travels around the galaxy with Surik as the ship's pilot. Along the journey, Surik learns more about Rand's past and his aversion to the Jedi; he has past experience in killing Jedi. She also discovers that Rand is [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and decides to train him to be a [[Jedi Sentinel/Legends|Jedi Sentinel]].\n\n===Bao-Dur===\n{{Main|Bao-Dur}}\n[[File:BaoDurPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Bao-Dur]]\n'''Bao-Dur''' is a [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] mechanical expert from [[Iridonia/Legends|Iridonia]]. He served under Meetra Surik during the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and was responsible for creating the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] during the [[Battle of Malachor V]]. He carries with him the guilt and shame of being ultimately responsible for so many deaths\u2014both on the surface and in the orbiting fleets\u2014when the device was activated to end the battle.\n\nAfter the war was over, Bao-Dur wanted to use his skills to help people as a means of redeeming himself, so he participated in the Republic-sponsored Restoration Project on [[Telos IV]]. He meets Surik again when she crash-lands en route to a [[Restoration Zone]], and decides to follow her around the galaxy. During their travels, Surik discovers that Bao-Dur is [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], so she trains him to be a [[Jedi Guardian/Legends|Jedi Guardian]].\n\nBao-Dur has replaced his left arm with an [[energy-arm]] that allows him to break through [[Force shield (helmet)|force shields]] and deal more damage. He is also accompanied by a small, spherical [[Bao-Dur's remote|remote droid]] which helps him with repairs.\n\n===Mical (Disciple)===\n{{Main|Mical}}\n[[File:Mical.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Mical]]\n'''Mical''' (also known as '''Disciple''') is a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who was briefly trained in the [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine]] as a [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Jedi youngling]]. By the time he was ready for further training, the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] had fallen apart due to the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and [[Jedi Civil War]], so his training was discontinued. He sought to preserve the Jedi's legacy by becoming a [[Jedi historian|historian]] and soldier in the service of the Republic. He also picked up some medical skills.\n\nWhile exploring the ruins of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, Mical encounters Meetra Surik, who is searching for the surviving [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]]. She welcomes him to join her when he offers to use his knowledge and skills to help her. Although Mical is initially reluctant to reveal his past, he eventually tells her about his Jedi training and how he met her before in his childhood. He accepts her offer to train him again and becomes a [[Jedi Consular]].\n\n===Visas Marr===\n{{Main|Visas Marr}}\n[[File:Visas_High_Rez.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Visas Marr]]\n'''Visas Marr''' is a [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]], a race of [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitives]] who can [[Force sight|\"see\" through the Force]], but are otherwise effectively blind. During the [[Dark Wars]], the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] tried to [[Conclave at Katarr|hold a meeting]] on [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]] (Marr's homeworld), hoping that their presence would be masked by the Miralukas' strong Force sensitivity. However, the meeting was disrupted when Darth Nihilus showed up and used his [[Force drain/Legends|Force drain]] to destroy all life on Katarr. Marr, the sole survivor, was taken prisoner by Nihilus, who forced her to become his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]].\n\nAs Meetra Surik rebuilds her connection to the Force, Nihilus senses her growing presence and sends Marr to hunt down and kill her. Marr ambushes Surik on the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' but Surik defeats her and spares her. Impressed by Surik's skill and her perceived destiny, Marr abandons the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and pledges allegiance to Surik.\n\n===Mira===\n{{Main|Mira}}\n[[File:Mira_High_Rez.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Mira]]\n'''Mira''' is a [[Human/Legends|Human]] female raised and trained by the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]], who destroyed her home and enslaved her during the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. She lost her adopted family when the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]] was activated during the [[Battle of Malachor V]]. After the battle, she ended up on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], where she became a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]. During this time, she got into a conflict with the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] bounty hunter [[Hanharr]], who relentlessly tries to hunt down and kill her.\n\nAfter Meetra Surik arrives on Nar Shaddaa, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]] secretly engages Mira to protect Surik from the other bounty hunters, who are seeking to collect Goto's bounty on Jedi. When [[Visquis]], the local [[Exchange]] boss, tries to lure Surik into a trap, Mira knocks out Surik and goes in place of her. However, she gets captured by Visquis, who forces her to fight Hanharr in the arena. She defeats Hanharr and leaves him apparently dead before escaping. She then joins Surik's companions in rescuing Surik from [[Visionary|G0-T0's yacht]] and accompanies Surik on her quest after that. Surik discovers Mira's [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force sensitivity]] later and trains her to be a [[Jedi Sentinel/Legends|Jedi Sentinel]].\n\n===G0-T0 (Goto)===\n{{Main|G0-T0}}\n[[File:Gotofull.jpg|thumb|left|120px|G0-T0]]\n'''G0-T0''' is a [[G0-T0 infrastructure planning system|planning droid]] created by the [[Aratech Repulsor Company/Legends|Aratech Repulsor Company]] to assist in rebuilding the Republic after the [[Jedi Civil War]]. After some time, the droid found itself unable to follow both of its directives\u2014rebuild the Republic ''and'' follow all Republic laws\u2014at the same time, so it chose to follow only the former. It set up a smuggling ring on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] and pretended to be a proxy for a man called '''Goto''', who does not exist in reality and appears only in [[Hologram/Legends|holograms]].\n\nG0-T0 placed a bounty on live Jedi with the intention of getting them to help rebuild and stabilize the Republic. However, the bounty hunters misinterpreted G0-T0's intentions and simply killed Jedi. G0-T0 also reactivated a hidden [[HK Manufacturing Plant]] on [[Telos IV]] which started producing [[HK-50 series assassin droid]]s to hunt and kill Jedi.\n\nWhen Meetra Surik comes to Nar Shaddaa, she is captured and taken on board [[Visionary|G0-T0's yacht]], where the droid reveals its plans for the Republic and asks for her help. After Surik escapes, G0-T0 presents itself on the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' as \"Goto's gift\" and insists on accompanying Surik and watching her stabilize [[Telos IV|Telos]], [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], and [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]]. Surik later deduces that \"Goto\" is in fact a droid pretending to be a person.\n\n===T3-M4===\n{{Main|T3-M4}}\n[[File:T3M4portrait.jpg|thumb|left|T3-M4]]\n'''T3-M4''' is a [[T3-series utility droid|utility droid]] which accompanied [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] on his search for the [[Star Forge]]. After the [[Battle of Rakata Prime]], Revan left for the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] and gave T3-M4 special instructions to seek any Jedi for help if they lost contact with each other.\n\nFive years later, T3-M4 finds an injured Meetra Surik on board the heavily damaged ''[[Ebon Hawk]]''. It manages to repair and navigate the ship to the nearby [[Peragus Mining Facility]]. After Surik awakens in the medical bay, T3-M4 helps her gain access to the fuel depot before it is attacked and disabled by a [[HK-50 series assassin droid|HK-50 assassin droid]]. Surik saves T3-M4 and they escape from Peragus together just before the system is destroyed. Since then, T3-M4 has remained in Surik's team and followed her on her journey across the galaxy.\n\n===HK-47===\n{{Main|HK-47}}\n[[File:RespectYourElders-K2.png|thumb|left|120px|HK-47]]\n'''HK-47''' is an [[HK-series assassin droid|assassin droid]] created by [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] after the [[Battle of Malachor V]] to assassinate his rivals. The droid was damaged and captured on a mission shortly before Revan was captured and rehabilitated by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. HK-47 reunited with its master on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] later and accompanied him on his search for the [[Star Forge]].\n\nSome time after Revan left for the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]], HK-47 was damaged and left on board the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', which eventually comes into the possession of Meetra Surik and her companions. Surik repairs HK-47, who recognizes her as its new master and follows her around the galaxy.\n\n===Canderous Ordo (Mandalore)===\n{{Main|Canderous Ordo}}\n[[File:Canderousmandalorefull.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Canderous Ordo as Mandalore]]\n'''Canderous Ordo''' (also known as '''Mandalore''') is a [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] who fought in the [[Mandalorian Wars]] against the Republic. He joined a redeemed [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] on his quest for the [[Star Forge]] and fought at the [[Battle of Rakata Prime]] against [[Darth Malak]].\n\nAfter the [[Jedi Civil War]] ended, Ordo claimed the position of [[Mandalore (title)/Legends|Mandalore]] (leader of the Mandalorians) with Revan's help. He built his base on the forest moon of [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]] and started working on reuniting the scattered Mandalorian clans and rebuilding Mandalorian power.\n\nWhen Meetra Surik is forced to land on Dxun en route to [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], she comes across the Mandalorian base and meets Mandalore. Mandalore promises to help her secure passage to [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] if she can prove herself worthy. Surik manages to impress the Mandalorians through her achievements on Dxun and earns their respect. In return, Mandalore keeps his word and accompanies her to Iziz to find [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kavar]]. After that, he decides to join Surik on her quest to reunite the surviving Jedi and defeat the Sith.\n\n===Brianna (Handmaiden)===\n{{Main|Brianna}}\n[[File:Briannaportrait.jpg|thumb|left|Brianna (Handmaiden)]]\n'''Brianna''' (also known as '''Handmaiden''') is a [[Human/Legends|Human]]-[[Echani/Legends|Echani]] female who served as a [[Handmaiden/Legends|handmaiden]] to Jedi Master Atris at the secret [[Jedi academy]] on [[Telos IV]]. She has five Echani half-sisters, who also serve as Atris's handmaidens.\n\nWhen Meetra Surik arrives at [[Citadel Station]], Atris sends Handmaiden to steal the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' and lure Surik to the academy. Surik shows up and convinces Atris to join the fight against the Sith and find the other surviving Jedi Masters. Before Surik leaves, Handmaiden speaks to her and expresses her interest in the ways of the Jedi.\n\nIf the player sets Surik as a male character, Handmaiden will sneak on board the ''Ebon Hawk'' and accompany him on his quest. After gaining sufficient influence with Handmaiden, the player can train her to be a [[Jedi Guardian/Legends|Jedi Guardian]].\n\n===Hanharr===\n{{Main|Hanharr}}\n[[File:Hanharrportrait.jpg|thumb|left|Hanharr]]\n'''Hanharr''' is a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] male from [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. A ruthless hunter and brutal sociopath, he slaughtered his entire village in cold blood, believing that this would prevent them from being enslaved by the [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]]. He eventually ended up on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] and became a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]. He also got into a conflict with Mira.\n\nWhen Meetra Surik arrives in Nar Shaddaa and is about to walk into a trap set by [[Visquis]], the local [[Exchange]] boss, Mira knocks out Surik and goes in place of her. Visquis captures Mira and forces her to fight Hanharr in the arena. She defeats Hanharr and leaves him apparently dead. Hanharr is secretly revived by Kreia, who manipulates him to do her bidding. He appears for the last time on [[Malachor V]], where he fights Mira again and dies by her hand (although she can choose to spare him).\n\nIf the player sets Surik as a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] character, Hanharr will kill Mira and join Surik's party.\n\n===Atris===\n{{Main|Atris}}\n[[File:Atrisportrait.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Atris]]\n'''Atris''' is a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] who served as a member of the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] during the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and [[Jedi Civil War]]. She was deeply committed to the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] and felt betrayed when Meetra Surik defied the Council and followed Revan to fight in the Mandalorian Wars. When Surik returned after the [[Battle of Malachor V]] to face the Council's judgment, Atris was the first to condemn her and call for her to be banished.\n\nDuring the [[Dark Wars]], Atris called the Jedi to attend [[Conclave at Katarr|a secret meeting]] on [[Katarr/Legends|Katarr]]. She then leaked out information about the meeting and hoped that doing so would lure the Sith out of the shadows. However, her plan backfired when Darth Nihilus showed up and used his [[Force drain/Legends|Force drain]] to destroy all life on Katarr\u2014leaving only Visas Marr alive.\n\nAtris retreated into seclusion on [[Telos IV]], where she established a secret [[Jedi academy]] in the polar regions and recruited the [[Handmaiden Sisters]] to be her bodyguards. Gradually and unknowingly, she fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] as she immersed herself in studying the [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]] she had collected in order to better understand the ways of the Sith, betraying herself and effectively becoming a '''Darth Traya'''.\n\nWhen Surik arrives at [[Citadel Station]], Atris sends Handmaiden to steal the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' and lure Surik to the academy. She blames Surik for the destruction of Peragus, but later reluctantly accepts Surik's offer to help her defeat the Sith. She instructs Surik to find the other surviving Jedi Masters and reunite them in the [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine]].\n\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote|The first story draft was pretty terrible, mostly because we weren't allowed to play K1 before drafting it, so we really knew nothing about the first game and were writing in the dark (Revan who?).|Chris Avellone, Lead Designer, about story development|<ref name=\"SWK ITW\">{{WebCite|url=http://www.starwarsknights.com/fullstory.php?id=386|text=StarWarsKnights Interview w/ Chris Avellone|date=2007-09-04|archivedate=20120118102130}}</ref>}}\n[[File:SWKotOR.png|thumb|left|250px|Official logo]]\nDevelopment of ''The Sith Lords'' began at approximately the same time that the original ''Knights of the Old Republic'' was released for the Xbox, on [[July 15]], [[2003]]. From the beginning, the production team had decided that the general atmosphere of the universe would be much darker than in ''Knights of the Old Republic'' and that the situation for the Jedi would be grim.<ref name=\"GameSpot Video Interview\">{{Gamespot|url=xbox/rpg/kotor2/video/6095390/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-developer-interview|text=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Developer Interview}}</ref> [[Chris Avellone]], Lead designer for the project, felt that it would be a challenging task to create a sequel to what he felt was an amazing story that BioWare had developed for the original ''Knights of the Old Republic'' and that there would be a lot of pressure created for the team. He began with determining what was considered fun in the gameplay elements and what kind of story would have to be developed to complement those elements. The next step was to watch\nevery Star Wars movie, read every book and comic book about the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] and even sitting through ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''. To him, it was vital to understand what adventures had already been created, the parameters of the EU, and which bad ideas it was prudent to stay away from. Only then did he feel it was time to look at the overall vision of the project.<ref name=\"Diary\">{{Gamespot|url=xbox/rpg/kotor2/news.html?sid=6109428&mode=previews|text=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Designer Diary #2}}</ref>\n\nThe first phase involved distinguishing the character, or the hero's motivation, from player motivation and how the story would develop to integrate the two. In ''The Sith Lords'', the character was a disgraced veteran of the [[Mandalorian Wars]] who was the last known Jedi in the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] and the target of [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Sith assassin/Legends|assassins]] who were determined to eradicate all Jedi. Certain circumstances had severed the hero's connection to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], but the character was being given a chance to slowly regain that connection and rediscover what it meant to be a Jedi or [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. The player motivation involved providing the teasers that would stimulate the player into wanting to continue the game and encourage the player to explore the story and locations fully. For example, this could have been accomplished by revealing critical information, introducing a new companion or acquiring new special abilities. It was felt that each stage of the game should ask ''and'' answer\nthe question \"Why should the player care?\"<ref name=\"Diary\" />\n\nThe following phase involved devising the critical story points and filling in the story to link those points together. The purpose was to throw the player for a loop, but allow enough foreshadowing so that the player would stay interested. After the overall story had been developed, the game outline was divided up between the designers who would then go about filling in the details of their particular section of the storyline.<ref name=\"Diary\" />The main goal was to give the player high adventure, lots of alien races and new worlds to visit. The development team also wanted to create a story that would pull the player into seriously thinking about the difference in using the Force for good and evil and the consequences of those actions.<ref name=\"Interview2\" />\n\nIn June 2009, in Kotaku Australia interview Chris Avellone revealed the \"true Sith\" planned to be remnants of [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow's]] Sith Empire, \"orchestrating the collapse of the Republic from behind the scenes, interfering with key events to cause echoes through the Force and leave it ripe for invasion \u2013 hopefully without a shot even being fired.\"<ref name=\"Kotaku Interview\">{{WebCite|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/06/question-time-your-interview-with-chris-avellone|text=Question Time: Your Interview With Chris Avellone|date=2009-06-03|work=[[Wikipedia:Kotaku|''Kotaku'']]|archivedate=20090607083434}}</ref>\n\nOn July 21st 2015, over ten years after the original release of ''The Sith Lords,'' [[Aspyr Media]] released a port of the game for both Mac and [[Wikipedia:Linux|Linux]].<ref name=\"Mac_Linux\" /> Aspyr also added several new features to the game including:\n*37 Achievements for both Steam and Game Center<ref name=\"TSLAchievements\">{{WebCite|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/208580/STAR_WARS_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II__The_Sith_Lords|text=STAR WARS\u2122 Knights of the Old Republic\u2122 II - The Sith Lords\u2122|work=[[Wikipedia:Steam (service)|Steam]]|archivedate=20200213144847}}</ref>\n*Gamepad support\n*Support for widescreen and native resolutions, including Retina/4k/5k resolutions\n*Steam Cloud saves (Steam only)\n*Steam Workshop support (Steam only)\n*A number of bug fixes.\nThese features were also passed onto the PC Windows version.<ref name=\"Mac_Linux2\">{{WebCite|url=http://blog.gameagent.com/faqs-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-mac-linux|text=FAQs: Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords (Mac/Linux)|author=Looney, Russ|date=2015-07-21|work=[[Wikipedia:GameAgent|GameAgent]]|archivedate=20160411164041}} Url accessed on July 25 2015</ref>\n\n==Continuity==\nAlthough the game did allow the game character be named freely, ''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''&mdash;Drew Karpyshyn novel released [[November]] [[2011]]&mdash;did reveal her canonical name to be Meetra Surik, and appearance that didn't match any of the available female appearances on the game.<ref name=\"Revan\">''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''</ref>\n\n===Alternative stories===\n{{Expand|1}}\nIf the player chooses to follow the dark side, they can throw Kreia into the core of Malachor V and assume the throne of headmistress of Trayus Academy.

The original game, however, was developed by a different company, BioWare. According to the games producers, the change of developers was primarily due to BioWares occupation with other titles, such as Jade Empire and Dragon Age. BioWare is understood to have recommended Obsidian Entertainment as an alternative developer, having worked with many of Obsidians key members when they were part of the now-defunct Black Isle Studios. The Sith Lords was constructed using an updated version of the original Knights of the Old Republic' Odyssey engine, which Obsidian obtained from BioWare.\n\n\u2022 Plot summary\n\n\u2022 Opening crawl\n\n\u2022 Synopsis\n\n(Note: This is based on the canonical female light side version of the game. Gender, Force alignment, order of planets visited and other variables can differ depending on the input of the player.)\n\n\u2022 Escape from Peragus\n\nSkirmish at Peragus II\n.]]\nIn 3951 BBY, four years after the end of the Jedi Civil War, Revans ship, the Ebon Hawk, emerges badly damaged in the Peragus system, with six passengers on board: two droids that belonged to Revan (T3-M4 and a disassembled HK-47), two other droids (3C-FD and a HK-50 assassin droid), and two unconscious Humans (Meetra Surik and Kreia). With 3C-FDs help, T3-M4 manages to dock the ship into the Peragus Mining Facility, where Surik is put into a kolto tank in the medical bay, while Kreia, assumed to be dead, is placed in the morgue.\nAfter regaining consciousness, Surik finds Kreia, who wakes up from her trance. She explores her surroundings and finds a smuggler, Atton Rand, whom she frees from a force cage. The three of them seem to be the only persons alive in the entire facility, which is covered with dead miners and crawling with assault-programmed mining droids that are \"mining\" organics. Surik eventually learns that the HK-50 assassin droid is after her because of a bounty placed by the Exchange on living Jedi since the collapse of the Jedi Order. The HK-50 assassin droid, which claims responsibility for all the deaths and damage at the facility, tries to stop Surik from leaving but she destroys it.\nIn the meantime, another ship arrives at Peragus: the Harbinger, the Republic capital ship transporting Surik to Telos IV before they ended up at Peragus. When Surik, Kreia, and Rand&mdash;in an attempt to escape from Peragus&mdash;board the Harbinger, they discover that the ship has been overrun by the Sith under Darth Sion. As Kreia approaches the Sith Lord in an attempt to distract him, Surik and Rand escape through one of the ship's fuel lines.\nMeanwhile, when Sion cuts off Kreias hand with his lightsaber, Surik discovers her newly formed Force bond with Kreia when she unexpectedly feels Kreias pain through the Force. Surik and Rand continue moving and meet up with T3-M4, which has been disabled earlier by the HK-50 assassin droid. Upon reaching the hangar bay, they board the Ebon Hawk and fend off attacks from Sith troopers. Kreia, who has managed to escape from Sion, catches up with them and gets on board too. As they fly into an asteroid field surrounding Peragus II, the Harbinger fires at the Ebon Hawk' but misses and hits one of the asteroids, triggering a series of explosions which completely destroy the mining facility, asteroid field, and the Peragus system itself.\n\n\u2022 Refuge on Telos\n\n.]]\nUsing the astrogation charts recovered from the Harbinger, Surik and her companions make their way to Citadel Station, the space station orbiting the war-ravaged Telos system. Upon their arrival, they are immediately disarmed and detained by the Telos Security Force under Lieutenant Dol Grenn for their apparent involvement in the destruction of Peragus&mdash;not coincidentally, the main fuel supplier for Citadel Station, without which the station cannot maintain its orbit around Telos. During the investigation, a mysterious woman steals the Ebon Hawk with T3-M4 on board.\nChodo Habat, the leader of the Ithorian herd responsible for the Republic restoration efforts on Telos, offers to help Surik restore her lost connection to the Force in exchange for dealing with their rival, Czerka Corporation. Despite Kreias disapproval, Surik accepts Habats offer and protects the Ithorians' interests from Czerka and the Exchange. In return, the Ithorians also provide her a shuttle to fly to the surface of Telos IV.\n, undergoing restoration after the Sith bombardment.]]\nEn route to the restoration zone on the surface, their shuttle is shot down by a Czerka air defense turret. Surik and her companions manage to crash-land near the Zabrak mechanic Bao-Dur, who served under Surik during the Mandalorian Wars. He has been working with the Ithorians to restore Telos IV after the wars.\nBao-Dur joins Surik and her companions and leads them to an abandoned Republic military base. Along the way, they fight some Czerka mercenaries and cannoks. Once they are at the base, Bao-Dur points out a breach in the planetary defense system in the polar regions as the most likely location of the Ebon Hawk. Surik and her companions then board another shuttle from the base to the polar regions.\n\n\u2022 Hidden Academy\n\non Telos.]]\nThe shuttle crash-lands on a polar plateau after being shot down by three HK-50 assassin droids. After destroying the droids, Surik discovers a Jedi academy hidden beneath the plateau.\nUpon entering, they are surrounded by the Handmaiden Sisters, who disarm and arrest them. Surik is brought before Atris, one of the Jedi Masters who previously exiled her from the Jedi Order for defying the Jedi Councils order to stay out of the Mandalorian Wars. Surik offers to help Atris deal with the new Sith threat and find any surviving Jedi. Impressed that Surik holds no grudge against her, Atris allows Surik to take back the Ebon Hawk' and leave with her companions.\nWhen the group assembles again on the Ebon Hawk, T3-M4 informs Surik that it has secretly downloaded a holorecord of her trial from Atris' archives. It turns out that there are four Jedi Masters in hiding\u2014Zez-Kai Ell, Kavar, Vrook Lamar, and Lonna Vash. She decides to find them to discuss a plan of action against the Sith and figure out why she has lost her connection to the Force.\n\n\u2022 Nar Shaddaa\n\non Nar Shaddaa.]]\nTheir first stop is Nar Shaddaa, a moon of Nal Hutta. The massive population and large cityscape of the moon makes it easy for anyone to hide and lay low for a while. In her attempt to find Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell, Surik actively provokes the Exchange by helping the refugees in the Refugee Sector who are being exploited by the Exchange. She and her companions also fend off some Jedi-hunting bounty hunters and Red Eclipse slavers. At one point, Surik is ambushed by Visas Marr, a Miraluka assassin working for the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. After defeating Marr, she shows kindness toward Marr, who, in return, pledges allegiance to Surik.\nAfter Surik is lured into a trap in the JekkJekk Tarr and captured by the Exchange boss Goto, the bounty hunter Mira teams up with Suriks companions to infiltrate Gotos yacht and rescue her. During their escape, Surik and her companions sabotage the yachts cloaking device and expose its position. Gotos rivals and Republic forces seize the opportunity to attack and destroy the yacht, while Surik and her companions escape on the Ebon Hawk. Goto apparently survives and orders his droid, G0-T0, to join Suriks team. Surik later deduces that \"Goto\" is actually a hologram constructed by G0-T0 to mask its true identity as a Republic planning droid which has gone rogue.\nAfter returning to Nar Shaddaa, Surik meets Zez-Kai Ell, who answers her questions and teaches her a new lightsaber form or new Force power. He also agrees to go to the former Jedi Enclave on Dantooine and wait there while Surik continues searching for the other Jedi Masters.\n\n\u2022 Dxun\n\nAfter leaving Nar Shaddaa, Surik seeks Jedi Master Kavar on Onderon. As the Ebon Hawk enters the Onderon system and joins the long queue into the starport on Onderons capital Iziz, Onderon starfighters under Colonel Tobin open fire at the Ebon Hawk and start a space battle above Iziz. The Ebon Hawk suffers heavy damage during the battle and is forced to land on Dxun, one of Onderons moons.\nWhile exploring Dxun in search of a way out, Surik discovers a covert Mandalorian camp deep in the jungle and encounters Canderous Ordo, who has claimed the title of Mandalore and currently seeks to unite the scattered Mandalorian clans under his leadership. Ordo promises to provide Surik passage to Iziz if she impresses him and his Mandalorian followers. After performing a number of feats, Surik gains the Mandalorians' trust and respect. Just as Surik is about to leave for Iziz with Ordo on his personal shuttle, the camp comes under attack by Sith assassins, who are swiftly dealt with by Surik and the Mandalorians.\n\n\u2022 Iziz\n\n.]]\nOnce Surik arrives in Iziz, she becomes aware of an ongoing political crisis in the capital. General Vaklu has declared martial law and has been rallying support for a coup against his cousin, Queen Talia. There are also many people demanding that Onderon secedes from the Republic. The Onderon armed forces have also split into two factions, with one side championing Vaklu and the other side remaining loyal to the Queen. Although Ordo wants Surik to support Vaklu in the power struggle, Surik is more inclined to side with Queen Talia. In the midst of all the political unrest, Surik tracks down Ordo's contact in Iziz, Dhagon Ghent, and learns that he has been arrested as a suspect for the murder of Captain Sullio. After Surik helps Ghent clear his name, he arranges for her to meet Jedi Master Kavar, who has been secretly serving as an adviser to the Queen.\nSurik and Kavars meeting at the cantina is cut short when Colonel Tobin and his soldiers show up to capture Kavar. Before fleeing the cantina, Kavar uses Force Stasis to stun Tobins soldiers and tells Surik that he will contact her later. While Tobin goes off in pursuit of the Jedi Master, Surik and her companions make their way out of Iziz and fight Vaklu's men who try to kill them.\n\n\u2022 Dantooine\n\nEnclave Sublevel.]]\nSurik leaves Dxun on the repaired Ebon Hawk and travels to the grassland planet of Dantooine, which is still recovering from the Sith attack during the Jedi Civil War. The surviving populace have established Khoonda, a makeshift government based in the former Matale residence, under the leadership of their Administrator, Terena Adare. Due to the damage caused by the Jedi Civil War, many people on Dantooine are suspicious and distrustful of the Jedi, or simply any lightsaber-wielding person.\nConcealing her Jedi identity, Surik interacts with the local settlers and hears rumors that Adare had met a Jedi. Adare later reveals to Surik that she is in contact with Jedi Master Vrook Lamar because she needs his help to protect the settlers; the Khoonda Militia is too small and weak to resist aggression from a group of mercenaries. Adare also grants Surik permission to search the ruins of the Jedi Enclave.\nAfter fighting several laigreks in the Enclave sublevel, Surik encounters Mical, a former Jedi Initiate whose training had been disrupted by the Mandalorian Wars. Now a historian and soldier in the service of the Republic, Mical has been sent by Admiral Carth Onasi to protect any Jedi artifacts he can find in the ruins. Mical becomes one of Surik's companions. Surik discovers a datapad in the library which shows that Lamar has been captured by the mercenaries and is being held captive in the crystal cave.\nSurik goes to the cave and tries to save Lamar by fighting the mercenaries, but the Jedi Master reprimands her for acting on impulse. It turns out that he had deliberately allowed himself to be captured so that he can find out how the mercenaries are planning to attack Khoonda; Surik's \"rescue\" had complicated matters. Just as Surik exits the cave, she meets Azkul, the mercenary leader, who asks her to help them in conquering Khoonda. Surik refuses and fights her way back to Khoonda.\nAt Khoonda, Surik strengthens the strongholds defenses by activating droids and security systems, as well as recruiting more people to join the Khoonda Militia, in preparation for an impending attack by the mercenaries. The Battle of Khoonda ultimately ends with the settlers victory. After the battle, Lamar answers Surik's questions and teaches her a new lightsaber form or new Force power. Through her courageous deeds, Surik not only gains the gratitude of the people of Dantooine, but also restores their faith in the Jedi.\n\n\u2022 Return to Dxun\n\nAfter Surik leaves Dantooine, she receives word from the Mandalorians on Dxun that Jedi Master Kavar has made contact and wants her to meet him in Iziz. On the same day, General Vaklu denounces Queen Talia as a traitor and declares war against her. Thus begins the Onderon Civil War.\nThe Sith, who have joined the civil war on Vaklus side, are using the tomb of Freedon Nadd on Dxun as their base of operations. Suriks companions join forces with the Mandalorians to launch an attack on the Sith at the tomb and manage to defeat them.\n\n\u2022 Return to Iziz\n\nIn the meantime, Surik flies on a salvaged Basilisk war droid into Iziz and participates in the civil war. With support from forces loyal to Queen Talia, she fights her way up the Sky Ramp and into the Royal Palace. In the palace, she teams up with Kavar and the loyalists to defeat Vaklu's forces and their Sith allies. In the throne room, Surik assists Queen Talia in a duel against Vaklu and defeats him; Vaklu is captured and his fate will be decided by the Queen. This marks the end of the civil war.\nAfter the battle, Kavar answers Surik's questions and teaches her a new lightsaber form or new Force power. Then, he leaves for the former Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, where all the missing Jedi Masters are to be reunited. In the meantime, Kreia secretly revives Colonel Tobin, who has been knocked unconscious during the battle, and orders him to deliver a message to Darth Nihilus to go to Telos IV.\n\n\u2022 Korriban\n\nSurik's final stop during her search for the missing Jedi Masters is the Sith homeworld of Korriban. While exploring the ruins of the Sith Academy at the Valley of the Dark Lords, Surik finds the dead body of the last missing Jedi Master, Lonna Vash. She also encounters Darth Sion, and briefly duels him until Kreia telepathically advises her to escape. Surik then explores the shyrack cave and enters the tomb of Ludo Kressh. In the tomb, she experiences visions of her past, her companions and Revan, and gains a deeper understanding of the Force.\n\n\u2022 Eyes of the Exile\n\nThroughout her journey across the galaxy, Surik regains her connection to the Force and, under Kreias guidance, starts her journey toward becoming a Jedi Master. She also learns much about her companions backstories. After discovering that Rand, Bao-Dur, Mira, and Mical are Force-sensitive, she trains them to eventually form a new generation of Jedi, whom Kreia refers to as the Lost Jedi&mdash;the true Jedi&mdash;disciples of Surik who will later form the basis of a new Jedi Order. Surik also learns from Kreia that Revan was Kreia's Padawan at one point in time, and that he has gone to the Unknown Regions to counter an unseen threat from beyond the Outer Rim.\nWhen the three surviving Jedi Masters&mdash;Zez-Kai Ell, Kavar, and Vrook&mdash;finally gather at the rebuilt Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, Surik learns from them that the Jedi Council did not cut off her connection to the Force. In fact, she did so herself when she created a wound in the Force by activating the Mass Shadow Generator during the Battle of Malachor V; the trauma of sensing so many deaths through the Force caused her to instinctively sever her connection to the Force.\nAfter Surik fails to persuade the Jedi Masters to unite against the Sith, they explain that the new Sith threat, in the form of Darth Nihilus, had caught them off guard. As Nihilus feeds on the Force, he causes widespread death and destruction to worlds which have a strong connection to the Force. That was what happened during the Jedi conclave at Katarr when Nihilus showed up and destroyed all the the Jedi who were present, along with the Force-sensitive Miraluka species by draining the Force from the planet, although the Miraluka Visas Marr survived.\nThe Jedi Masters conclude that Surik has regained her connection to the Force by feeding on the life energy of her companions through her ability to form Force bonds with them. As they are worried that the Exile will, through the Force, lead the Sith to them and eventually cause the death of the Force, they want to strip her of her connection to the Force against her will.\nAt that moment, Kreia appears, berates the Jedi Masters for their arrogance and ignorance, and uses an extreme form of Force drain to make them undergo the same loss Surik felt at Malachor V. Unable to live without the Force, the three Jedi Masters die almost immediately. Although Surik retains her connection to the Force, she becomes unconscious. In the meantime, the Handmaiden Sisters dash into the Enclave and take Kreia prisoner before delivering her to their mistress, Atris.\n\n\u2022 Admission of Atris\n\nWhen Surik regains consciousness, she finds out from her companions about what had happened, and returns to the Jedi academy on Telos IV to find Kreia. She figures out that the Force bond between her and Kreia is lethal; this meant that if Kreia dies, Surik will die as well.\nIn the meantime, Kreia reveals to Atris that she has fallen to the dark side and become Darth Traya. The irony is that Atris, in her attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order and prevent any future Jedi from falling to the ways of the Sith, has been corrupted by her studies of the ways of the Sith. After Kreia exposes her, Atris fully embraces her persona of Darth Traya and admits her fall to darkness. Kreia then leaves.\nShortly after, Surik shows up to confront the fallen Jedi Master and defeats her. However, against Atris's expectations, Surik does not kill her and spares her life instead. Realizing that perhaps she can find her true self if she will simply let go of her flawed ideas about the Jedi, Atris awaits judgement at her sanctum of Sith holocrons within the Telos academy. She also tells Surik that the Sith are about to attack Telos, and that Kreia has left for Malachor V, where she will wait for the Exile to finish what she has begun there.\n\n\u2022 The Battle of Telos\n\nBattle of Telos IV\nWhen Surik arrives at Citadel Station, she sees that the Sith attack has already begun. Along with the Telos Security Force and reinforcements from the Republic, Dantooine and Onderon, Surik and her companions fight the Sith and clear the station of enemy forces.\nSurik then teams up with Marr, Ordo and the Mandalorians to board an orbital shuttle and infiltrate Darth Nihiluss ship, the Ravager'. Once on board, they plant proton charges on the ship and head to the bridge to confront the Sith Lord.\nDuring their duel, Nihilus attempts to drain the Force from Surik in the same way he did to other Jedi, but it proves to be his undoing\u2014instead of feeding on Suriks connection to the Force, he is weakened by the echoes of the wound in the Force that she carries with her. With Marr helping to distract the Sith Lord, Surik ultimately defeats Nihilus and claims his mask. Surik and her companions then escape from the Ravager' just before it blows up. The remaining Sith forces either flee or are destroyed, thus bringing an end to the battle.\nUpon Surik's return to Citadel Station, Admiral Carth Onasi has a private meeting with her, during which he relates to her the story of how he met Revan, and enlists her help in finding Revan in the Unknown Regions. After Surik leaves, Onasi meets Bastila Shan and talks to her about Revan.\n\n\u2022 Exile of the echoes\n\nBattle of Malachor\nSurik and her companions travel to Malachor V, where the war-torn planets unstable environment causes the Ebon Hawk to crash. Surik navigates her way on foot across the planets inhospitable landscape and reaches the Trayus Academy.\nIn the Trayus Academy, Surik defeats the Sith forces and duels Darth Sion. Despite the Sith Lord's regenerative abilities, Surik convinces him to let go of his pain and willingly accept death, thus ending his immortality.\nSurik then confronts Kreia in the Trayus Core. Kreia refuses redemption and forces Surik to either kill her, to let go of the echoes of Malachor V, or be killed and allow death to consume the galaxy. Kreia is ultimately defeated by the Exile.\nUpon her defeat, Kreia gazes into the future, revealing the future of Surik's companions, of the planets they had visited, of the Mandalorians, and of the Republic. She also says that Revan came to Malachor V after the Mandalorian Wars and again after the Jedi Civil War, and that he has discovered evidence of the \"True Sith,\" whom he has gone to fight \"in his own way.\"\nMeanwhile, on Malachor Vs surface, Bao-Durs remote powers up and reactivates the Mass Shadow Generator despite G0-T0s attempt to stop it. As Malachor V collapses upon itself once again, the Ebon Hawk' arrives in time to save Surik while Kreia plunges to her death in the Trayus Core. Surik then heads off to the Unknown Regions in search of Revan.\n\n\u2022 Major characters\n\n1\nThis is based on the canonical female light side version of the game.\n\n\u2022 Meetra Surik\n\nMeetra Surik\nMeetra Surik (also known as the Jedi Exile) is the protagonist of Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. Ten years before the events of the story, Surik fought as a Jedi General alongside Revan during the Mandalorian Wars. At the climactic Battle of Malachor V, she activated the Mass Shadow Generator, which caused over a thousand instantaneous deaths. Although this event ended the war, the trauma of sensing so many deaths through the Force caused Surik to instinctively sever her connection to the Force, and she was subsequently banished from the Jedi Order. After wandering the periphery of the galaxy for a decade, Surik is drawn into the conflict between the Republic and the Sith. Gathering companions and healing the dying Jedi Order in her journey, Surik ultimately eliminates the Lords of the Sith Triumvirate, encountering the shadows of her past along the way and conquering her inner demons. She eventually defeats Kreia in the Trayus Core on Malachor V, thus ending the threat she posed.\n\n\u2022 Darth Sion\n\nDarth Sion\nDarth Sion (also known as the Lord of Pain) is one of the three Sith Lords of the Sith Triumvirate. Formerly a warrior serving under Exar Kun, he was killed in battle during the Great Sith War. However, he resurrected himself by harnessing his hatred through the Force, thereby allowing him to rise from the dead whenever he is defeated. His immortality comes at a great cost, however, because his wounds never heal and he constantly suffers from pain. During the Jedi Civil War, Sion sided with the Sith against the Republic and formed the Sith Triumvirate with Darth Traya. However, he betrayed Traya when he believed that she was growing too weak for the Sith, and led his forces on a five-year long extermination of the Jedi. When Meetra Surik returns to the galaxy after ten years of absence, Sion becomes obsessed with hunting her down. She evades him during each encounter. Eventually, Surik confronts Sion in the Trayus Academy on Malachor V, where she overcomes the Sith Lord and convinces him to abandon his hatred and willingly accept his death. Sion might have also died willingly as to end his pain.\n\n\u2022 Darth Nihilus\n\nDarth Nihilus\nDarth Nihilus (also known as the Lord of Hunger) is one of the three Sith Lords of the Sith Triumvirate. His past life is almost completely shrouded in mystery, apart from the fact that he was a former Jedi who fought under Revan during the Mandalorian Wars. During the catastrophic end of the Battle of Malachor V, the man who became Nihilus miraculously survived Meetra Suriks activation of the Mass Shadow Generator, though the experience left him scarred. The strain of sensing so many deaths through the Force caused Nihilus to crave Force energy, and he kept himself alive on the dead planet by draining the Force from whatever vessel he came across. This misuse of Force power caused his physical form to degenerate until he had to encase his spirit inside his mask and armor in order to stay alive. He was eventually found by Darth Traya, who trained him and Darth Sion as her apprentices. The Sith Triumvirate then led a five-year long galactic extermination of the Jedi. Nihilus later aided Sion in overthrowing Traya, and then detached himself from Sion, causing major destruction and taking on an apprentice of his own, Visas Marr. Nihilus is later lured to Telos IV by Kreia, the former Darth Traya, under the pretense that there are Jedi on the planet for him to consume. He is drawn into a confrontation with Meetra Surik and a redeemed Marr, who fight him on board the Ravager' and eventually slay him.\n\n\u2022 Kreia\n\nKreia\nKreia is a mysterious old woman whom Meetra Surik meets in the Peragus Mining Facility after eluding Darth Sion and his Sith assassins. A powerful Force sensitive, Kreia serves as Suriks mentor through her journey to restore order to the Republic, helping her reestablish her connection to the Force. While her motives are initially shrouded in mystery, Surik gradually learns of Kreias origins as Revans original master. She was blamed for Revans fall after the Mandalorian Wars and banished from the Jedi Order as punishment. Turning to the dark side, Kreia became Darth Traya, took control of the remnants of Darth Revan's Sith Empire, and formed the Sith Triumvirate. Before she could take revenge against the Jedi, Kreia was betrayed by her two apprentices, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus, who cut off her connection to the Force. Kreia then takes Surik as her new apprentice, seeing her potential as a wound in the Force to remove the influence of the will of the Force from sentients, allowing individuals to let go of their instinctual dependency on the higher power and be themselves. Her plan succeeds when she is killed by Meetra Surik in the Trayus Core on Malachor V&mdash;the Jedi Exile has let her bond to Kreia die, and is freed from the tragedy of Malachor V that echoed throughout her journey thereafter.\n\n\u2022 Atton Rand\n\nAtton Rand\nAtton Rand is a former Republic soldier who served under Revan during the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War. After the wars, he became a smuggler. At one point in time, he was captured and imprisoned in the Peragus Mining Facility until Meetra Surik frees him. After escaping from Peragus on the Ebon Hawk, Rand travels around the galaxy with Surik as the ships pilot. Along the journey, Surik learns more about Rands past and his aversion to the Jedi; he has past experience in killing Jedi. She also discovers that Rand is Force-sensitive and decides to train him to be a Jedi Sentinel.\n\n\u2022 Bao-Dur\n\nBao-Dur\nBao-Dur is a Zabrak mechanical expert from Iridonia. He served under Meetra Surik during the Mandalorian Wars and was responsible for creating the Mass Shadow Generator during the Battle of Malachor V. He carries with him the guilt and shame of being ultimately responsible for so many deaths\u2014both on the surface and in the orbiting fleets\u2014when the device was activated to end the battle.\nAfter the war was over, Bao-Dur wanted to use his skills to help people as a means of redeeming himself, so he participated in the Republic-sponsored Restoration Project on Telos IV. He meets Surik again when she crash-lands en route to a Restoration Zone, and decides to follow her around the galaxy. During their travels, Surik discovers that Bao-Dur is Force-sensitive, so she trains him to be a Jedi Guardian.\nBao-Dur has replaced his left arm with an energy-arm that allows him to break through force shields and deal more damage. He is also accompanied by a small, spherical remote droid which helps him with repairs.\n\n\u2022 Mical (Disciple)\n\nMical\nMical (also known as Disciple) is a Force-sensitive Human who was briefly trained in the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine as a Jedi youngling. By the time he was ready for further training, the Jedi Order had fallen apart due to the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War, so his training was discontinued. He sought to preserve the Jedi's legacy by becoming a historian and soldier in the service of the Republic. He also picked up some medical skills.\nWhile exploring the ruins of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, Mical encounters Meetra Surik, who is searching for the surviving Jedi Masters. She welcomes him to join her when he offers to use his knowledge and skills to help her. Although Mical is initially reluctant to reveal his past, he eventually tells her about his Jedi training and how he met her before in his childhood. He accepts her offer to train him again and becomes a Jedi Consular.\n\n\u2022 Visas Marr\n\nVisas Marr\nVisas Marr is a Miraluka, a race of Force-sensitives who can \"see\" through the Force, but are otherwise effectively blind. During the Dark Wars, the Jedi Order tried to hold a meeting on Katarr (Marrs homeworld), hoping that their presence would be masked by the Miralukas strong Force sensitivity. However, the meeting was disrupted when Darth Nihilus showed up and used his Force drain to destroy all life on Katarr. Marr, the sole survivor, was taken prisoner by Nihilus, who forced her to become his apprentice.\nAs Meetra Surik rebuilds her connection to the Force, Nihilus senses her growing presence and sends Marr to hunt down and kill her. Marr ambushes Surik on the Ebon Hawk but Surik defeats her and spares her. Impressed by Surik's skill and her perceived destiny, Marr abandons the dark side and pledges allegiance to Surik.\n\n\u2022 Mira\n\nMira\nMira is a Human female raised and trained by the Mandalorians, who destroyed her home and enslaved her during the Mandalorian Wars. She lost her adopted family when the Mass Shadow Generator was activated during the Battle of Malachor V. After the battle, she ended up on Nar Shaddaa, where she became a bounty hunter. During this time, she got into a conflict with the Wookiee bounty hunter Hanharr, who relentlessly tries to hunt down and kill her.\nAfter Meetra Surik arrives on Nar Shaddaa, Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell secretly engages Mira to protect Surik from the other bounty hunters, who are seeking to collect Gotos bounty on Jedi. When Visquis, the local Exchange boss, tries to lure Surik into a trap, Mira knocks out Surik and goes in place of her. However, she gets captured by Visquis, who forces her to fight Hanharr in the arena. She defeats Hanharr and leaves him apparently dead before escaping. She then joins Suriks companions in rescuing Surik from G0-T0s yacht and accompanies Surik on her quest after that. Surik discovers Miras Force sensitivity later and trains her to be a Jedi Sentinel.\n\n\u2022 G0-T0 (Goto)\n\nG0-T0\nG0-T0 is a planning droid created by the Aratech Repulsor Company to assist in rebuilding the Republic after the Jedi Civil War. After some time, the droid found itself unable to follow both of its directives\u2014rebuild the Republic and follow all Republic laws\u2014at the same time, so it chose to follow only the former. It set up a smuggling ring on Nar Shaddaa and pretended to be a proxy for a man called Goto, who does not exist in reality and appears only in holograms.\nG0-T0 placed a bounty on live Jedi with the intention of getting them to help rebuild and stabilize the Republic. However, the bounty hunters misinterpreted G0-T0's intentions and simply killed Jedi. G0-T0 also reactivated a hidden HK Manufacturing Plant on Telos IV which started producing HK-50 series assassin droids to hunt and kill Jedi.\nWhen Meetra Surik comes to Nar Shaddaa, she is captured and taken on board G0-T0s yacht, where the droid reveals its plans for the Republic and asks for her help. After Surik escapes, G0-T0 presents itself on the Ebon Hawk as \"Gotos gift\" and insists on accompanying Surik and watching her stabilize Telos, Dantooine, and Onderon. Surik later deduces that \"Goto\" is in fact a droid pretending to be a person.\n\n\u2022 T3-M4\n\nT3-M4\nT3-M4 is a utility droid which accompanied Revan on his search for the Star Forge. After the Battle of Rakata Prime, Revan left for the Unknown Regions and gave T3-M4 special instructions to seek any Jedi for help if they lost contact with each other.\nFive years later, T3-M4 finds an injured Meetra Surik on board the heavily damaged Ebon Hawk. It manages to repair and navigate the ship to the nearby Peragus Mining Facility. After Surik awakens in the medical bay, T3-M4 helps her gain access to the fuel depot before it is attacked and disabled by a HK-50 assassin droid. Surik saves T3-M4 and they escape from Peragus together just before the system is destroyed. Since then, T3-M4 has remained in Surik's team and followed her on her journey across the galaxy.\n\n\u2022 HK-47\n\nHK-47\nHK-47 is an assassin droid created by Revan after the Battle of Malachor V to assassinate his rivals. The droid was damaged and captured on a mission shortly before Revan was captured and rehabilitated by the Jedi Order. HK-47 reunited with its master on Tatooine later and accompanied him on his search for the Star Forge.\nSome time after Revan left for the Unknown Regions, HK-47 was damaged and left on board the Ebon Hawk, which eventually comes into the possession of Meetra Surik and her companions. Surik repairs HK-47, who recognizes her as its new master and follows her around the galaxy.\n\n\u2022 Canderous Ordo (Mandalore)\n\nCanderous Ordo\nCanderous Ordo (also known as Mandalore) is a Mandalorian who fought in the Mandalorian Wars against the Republic. He joined a redeemed Revan on his quest for the Star Forge and fought at the Battle of Rakata Prime against Darth Malak.\nAfter the Jedi Civil War ended, Ordo claimed the position of Mandalore (leader of the Mandalorians) with Revan's help. He built his base on the forest moon of Dxun and started working on reuniting the scattered Mandalorian clans and rebuilding Mandalorian power.\nWhen Meetra Surik is forced to land on Dxun en route to Onderon, she comes across the Mandalorian base and meets Mandalore. Mandalore promises to help her secure passage to Iziz if she can prove herself worthy. Surik manages to impress the Mandalorians through her achievements on Dxun and earns their respect. In return, Mandalore keeps his word and accompanies her to Iziz to find Jedi Master Kavar. After that, he decides to join Surik on her quest to reunite the surviving Jedi and defeat the Sith.\n\n\u2022 Brianna (Handmaiden)\n\nBrianna\nBrianna (also known as Handmaiden) is a Human-Echani female who served as a handmaiden to Jedi Master Atris at the secret Jedi academy on Telos IV. She has five Echani half-sisters, who also serve as Atris's handmaidens.\nWhen Meetra Surik arrives at Citadel Station, Atris sends Handmaiden to steal the Ebon Hawk and lure Surik to the academy. Surik shows up and convinces Atris to join the fight against the Sith and find the other surviving Jedi Masters. Before Surik leaves, Handmaiden speaks to her and expresses her interest in the ways of the Jedi.\nIf the player sets Surik as a male character, Handmaiden will sneak on board the Ebon Hawk and accompany him on his quest. After gaining sufficient influence with Handmaiden, the player can train her to be a Jedi Guardian.\n\n\u2022 Hanharr\n\nHanharr\nHanharr is a Wookiee male from Kashyyyk. A ruthless hunter and brutal sociopath, he slaughtered his entire village in cold blood, believing that this would prevent them from being enslaved by the Czerka Corporation. He eventually ended up on Nar Shaddaa and became a bounty hunter. He also got into a conflict with Mira.\nWhen Meetra Surik arrives in Nar Shaddaa and is about to walk into a trap set by Visquis, the local Exchange boss, Mira knocks out Surik and goes in place of her. Visquis captures Mira and forces her to fight Hanharr in the arena. She defeats Hanharr and leaves him apparently dead. Hanharr is secretly revived by Kreia, who manipulates him to do her bidding. He appears for the last time on Malachor V, where he fights Mira again and dies by her hand (although she can choose to spare him).\nIf the player sets Surik as a dark side character, Hanharr will kill Mira and join Surik's party.\n\n\u2022 Atris\n\nAtris\nAtris is a Jedi Master who served as a member of the Jedi Council during the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War. She was deeply committed to the Jedi Code and felt betrayed when Meetra Surik defied the Council and followed Revan to fight in the Mandalorian Wars. When Surik returned after the Battle of Malachor V to face the Council's judgment, Atris was the first to condemn her and call for her to be banished.\nDuring the Dark Wars, Atris called the Jedi to attend a secret meeting on Katarr. She then leaked out information about the meeting and hoped that doing so would lure the Sith out of the shadows. However, her plan backfired when Darth Nihilus showed up and used his Force drain to destroy all life on Katarr\u2014leaving only Visas Marr alive.\nAtris retreated into seclusion on Telos IV, where she established a secret Jedi academy in the polar regions and recruited the Handmaiden Sisters to be her bodyguards. Gradually and unknowingly, she fell to the dark side as she immersed herself in studying the Sith holocrons she had collected in order to better understand the ways of the Sith, betraying herself and effectively becoming a Darth Traya.\nWhen Surik arrives at Citadel Station, Atris sends Handmaiden to steal the Ebon Hawk and lure Surik to the academy. She blames Surik for the destruction of Peragus, but later reluctantly accepts Surik's offer to help her defeat the Sith. She instructs Surik to find the other surviving Jedi Masters and reunite them in the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.\n\n\u2022 Development\n\nChris Avellone, Lead Designer, about story development\nDevelopment of The Sith Lords began at approximately the same time that the original Knights of the Old Republic was released for the Xbox, on July 15, 2003. From the beginning, the production team had decided that the general atmosphere of the universe would be much darker than in Knights of the Old Republic and that the situation for the Jedi would be grim. Chris Avellone, Lead designer for the project, felt that it would be a challenging task to create a sequel to what he felt was an amazing story that BioWare had developed for the original Knights of the Old Republic and that there would be a lot of pressure created for the team. He began with determining what was considered fun in the gameplay elements and what kind of story would have to be developed to complement those elements. The next step was to watch\nevery Star Wars movie, read every book and comic book about the Expanded Universe and even sitting through The Star Wars Holiday Special. To him, it was vital to understand what adventures had already been created, the parameters of the EU, and which bad ideas it was prudent to stay away from. Only then did he feel it was time to look at the overall vision of the project.\nThe first phase involved distinguishing the character, or the heros motivation, from player motivation and how the story would develop to integrate the two. In The Sith Lords, the character was a disgraced veteran of the Mandalorian Wars who was the last known Jedi in the galaxy and the target of dark side assassins who were determined to eradicate all Jedi. Certain circumstances had severed the heros connection to the Force, but the character was being given a chance to slowly regain that connection and rediscover what it meant to be a Jedi or Sith. The player motivation involved providing the teasers that would stimulate the player into wanting to continue the game and encourage the player to explore the story and locations fully. For example, this could have been accomplished by revealing critical information, introducing a new companion or acquiring new special abilities. It was felt that each stage of the game should ask and answer\nthe question \"Why should the player care?\"\nThe following phase involved devising the critical story points and filling in the story to link those points together. The purpose was to throw the player for a loop, but allow enough foreshadowing so that the player would stay interested. After the overall story had been developed, the game outline was divided up between the designers who would then go about filling in the details of their particular section of the storyline.The main goal was to give the player high adventure, lots of alien races and new worlds to visit. The development team also wanted to create a story that would pull the player into seriously thinking about the difference in using the Force for good and evil and the consequences of those actions.\nIn June 2009, in Kotaku Australia interview Chris Avellone revealed the \"true Sith\" planned to be remnants of Naga Sadows Sith Empire, \"orchestrating the collapse of the Republic from behind the scenes, interfering with key events to cause echoes through the Force and leave it ripe for invasion \u2013 hopefully without a shot even being fired.\"\nOn July 21st 2015, over ten years after the original release of The Sith Lords, Aspyr Media released a port of the game for both Mac and Linux. Aspyr also added several new features to the game including:\n\u2022 37 Achievements for both Steam and Game Center\n\n\u2022 Gamepad support\n\n\u2022 Support for widescreen and native resolutions, including Retina/4k/5k resolutions\n\n\u2022 Steam Cloud saves (Steam only)\n\n\u2022 Steam Workshop support (Steam only)\n\n\u2022 A number of bug fixes.\n\nThese features were also passed onto the PC Windows version. Url accessed on July 25 2015\n\n\u2022 Continuity\n\nAlthough the game did allow the game character be named freely, The Old Republic: Revan&mdash;Drew Karpyshyn novel released November 2011&mdash;did reveal her canonical name to be Meetra Surik, and appearance that didnt match any of the available female appearances on the game.The Old Republic: Revan'\n\n\u2022 Alternative stories\n\n1\nIf the player chooses to follow the dark side, they can throw Kreia into the core of Malachor V and assume the throne of headmistress of Trayus Academy. Meanwhile, G0-T0 destroys Bao-Dur's remote and deactivates the Mass Shadow Generator, keeping the planet intact.\n\n\u2022 Sequels\n\nBoth Obsidian and LucasArts have expressed a desire to yet again expand upon the franchise, LucasArts representatives stating they have no intention of abandoning Knights of the Old Republic. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 3 was in development, but was cancelled sometime in 2004 due to a difficult period for LucasArts. In March 2007, news of a spin-off was made official when \"Aristotle,\" owner of a Knights' fansite, interviewed several staff members of LucasArts.\nLater in the year, Electronic Gaming Monthly reported in the rumors section of their May 2007 issue that BioWare had hired an online team for work on a massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the Knights of the Old Republic series. The game, Star Wars: The Old Republic, was finally and officially announced in July 2008 by EA CEO John Riccitiello. It was finally released December 20th, 2011, and was generally well received by the critics.\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\nCut content from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords\nBecause of the flexibility of the games Odyssey game engine, The Sith Lords' is often a subject of modding in the gaming community. A number of modding groups have attempted to recreate and restore missing or cut content left in the game files.\nTeam Gizkas project was the first of these, founded in 2004 to promise restored content and save the cut M4-78 Droid planet. In early 2008 their project reached closed beta stage. Other modders, using the handles DarthStoney and Zbyl, created a restoration mod inspired by Team Gizka which accomplished all of Team Gizkas initial goals, including a restored HK factory and various bug fixes. As of late 2010, the Team Gizka site was disbanded.\nBetween 2009 and 2014, a full-scale mod known as The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod saw several releases that restored most of the cut content.\n\n\u2022 Credits\n\n\u2022 Voice cast\n\nSteven Jay Blum]] - Additional Voices\n\u2022 Timothy Omundson - Additional Voices\n\n\u2022 Tish Hicks - Additional Voices\n\n\u2022 Tom Kane - Master Vandar Tokare, Master Kavar, additional voices\n\n\u2022 Vanessa Marshall - Additional Voices\n\n\u2022 Crew\n\n\u2022 CEO and Executive Producer - Feargus Urquhart\n\n\u2022 Producer - Chris Parker, Michael Gallo\n\n\u2022 Lead Designer - Chris Avellone\n\n\u2022 Design Team - Ferret Baudoin, Michael Chu, Tony Evans, Scott Everts, John Morgan, Kevin Saunders, David Maldonado\n\n\u2022 Composer - Mark Griskey\n\n\u2022 Art\n\n\u2022 Lead Artist - Aaron J.

One such Star Destroyer was the [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] of the Galactic Republic. In the [[Anaxes War College System/Legends|Anaxes War College System]], any warship that was between 1 and 2 kilometers in length qualifies as a Star Destroyer, excepting cases where the vessel, despite its length matching that of a [[Heavy cruiser/Legends|heavy cruiser]] or [[Battlecruiser/Legends|battlecruiser]], had less or more armaments than their class or role. Examples include the 900m [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-series]] of Star Destroyer and the 2.2km [[Secutor-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Secutor''-class Star Destroyer]].

The dagger-shape was said to facilitate the ease of this by focusing the firepower forward.

Or this might have been just a generalization.\n\nThe term \"Star Destroyer\" is used both for different classes of destroyers and as a general term for most dagger-shaped warships in use by the Empire, from smaller frigates like the ''[[Demolisher]]'' to giant dreadnoughts like the ''Executor'' and the [[Eclipse (Eclipse-class)|''Eclipse'']]. This has created some ambiguity, as many sources describe ships only as a \"Star Destroyer\" or \"Imperial Star Destroyer.\" Since many stories have historically focused on the 1,600-meter-long ''Imperial''-class, it is used as a default reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nIn the endnotes for ''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'', Jason Fry mentioned that he initially had trouble coming up with a class for the various Star Destroyers, until he eventually settled on making Star Destroyer a ship class, due to it being used synonymously with a big capital ship, which likewise implied a ship class.<ref name=\"EGWendnotes\">{{Tumblr|subdomain=jasonfry|url=post/21215590247/eg-to-warfare-endnotes-pt-3|name=Jason Fry's Dorkery|text=EG to Warfare: Endnotes Pt. 3|archivedate=20120427183416}}</ref>\n\nLego has released a set featuring the Star Destroyer.

    "plain_text": "Star Destroyer]]\"\n, second generation of the Galactic Empire's signature vessel]]\nVI\nStar Destroyer was a term used to describe a certain type of medium-sizedStar Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections capital ship Star Wars: Complete Locations, p. 171 used by various factions such as the Sith Empire, the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire, the New Republic, the Imperial Remnant, the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, the Alliance-in-exile, the Fel Empire, Darth Krayts Galactic Empire and the Galactic Federation Triumvirate. It was also used to describe heavily armed warships in general.Starships of the Galaxy', Saga Edition\nThe term originated with the idea of a warship powerful enough to destroy entire star systems, and did not necessarily indicate a destroyer type vessel. Despite this, Star Destroyers were sometimes referred to as destroyers themselves. One such Star Destroyer was the Venator-class Star Destroyer of the Galactic Republic. In the Anaxes War College System, any warship that was between 1 and 2 kilometers in length qualifies as a Star Destroyer, excepting cases where the vessel, despite its length matching that of a heavy cruiser or battlecruiser, had less or more armaments than their class or role. Examples include the 900m Victory-series of Star Destroyer and the 2.2km Secutor-class Star Destroyer. Ships with a dagger profile that fall into the Battlecruiser or Dreadnaught classes are referred to as Super Star Destroyers.\n\n\u2022 Characteristics\n\n, the Immobilizer 418 cruiser or the Victory II-class frigate possessed the typical characteristic of such vessels - a wedge shaped hull and command tower.]]\nThe term originated within the Old Republic and referred to ships capable of destroying entire star systems with their heavy firepower. The dagger-shape was said to facilitate the ease of this by focusing the firepower forward. Any vessel that conformed to this design, could be considered a class of Star Destroyer. Even so, many models were designed with their heavy guns aimed to the sides of the vessel, obstructing each others line-of-sight in other directions.Star Wars: Incredible Cross-Sections'\nIn stricter terms, Star Destroyers were the relatively common warships that dwarfed the frigates and cruisers of one of the Galactic Empires standard warship scales,Imperial Sourcebook and were smaller than Imperial Star Cruisers. Based on descriptions of the Star Dreadnought Executor, the Imperial Star Destroyer/Star Cruiser cut-off point lay somewhere around a length of 3.8 kilometers.A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, the size of the Executor' was described as \"five times larger than any Star Destroyer in the Imperial fleet\", and length is often used as the dimension that determines ship-size in SW books. Destroyers could usually carry 10,000 or more people aboard it.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Star Destroyers were considered medium-weight warships. With the increase in warship-sizes during the time of the Empire, Star Destroyers were sometimes denoted as smaller vessels in the Imperial Navy. Star Wars: Complete Locations, p. 143 In combat, Star Destroyers usually surpassed contemporary destroyer designs, similar to how the star frigates eclipsed most contemporary frigate classes. The Star Destroyer designation was usually used for warships ranging from about 500 metersStar Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3POThe Force Unleashed Campaign Guide to about 3.8 kilometers in length, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Incredible Cross-Sections, p. 11 Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire, p. 12 but the general term was used for much larger vessels as well. Imperial Sourcebook, p. 63\nAfter the formation of the Anaxes War College System during the early stages of the Galactic Empire, Star Destroyers were classified as generally being between 1000 to 2000 meters in length. However, if the ship in question has fewer weapons than its standard class and the ship is larger (eg, the 2,200 meter Secutor-class Star Destroyer), that ship will be classified as a Star Destroyer.The Essential Guide to Warfare\nIn the time of the second Galactic Empire, Star Destroyers were described as some of the largest and most powerful warships of the time, taking some design-cues from Star Dreadnoughts like the Executor-class and performing the roles of large battleships despite their compact frame.Star Wars: Legacy' (2006) 0 Many Star Destroyer classes throughout the various eras doubled as carriers. In these cases, they often contained one or several wings of starfighters.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Early designs\n\nInterdictor-class cruiser circa 3956 BBY.]]\ncirca 3681 BBY.]]\nThe use of wedge-shaped warships seems to be an ancient trend, dating as far back as over four millennia before the rise of the Galactic Empire. The designs were not limited to any one culture, having been observed frequently in both Galactic RepublicKnights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide and Sith Empire navies.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\nDuring the Mandalorian Wars 3,963 years before the Battle of Yavin, a Venator-like warship was used by the fleets of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders.Knights of the Old Republic 17\nDuring the same conflicts, the wedge-shaped Interdictor-class cruiser and the Centurion-class battlecruiser were employed by Galactic Republic and later served in the navy of the Sith Empire established by Darth Revan. Examples of these ships included the Leviathan and the Ravager.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords'\nThe first design explicitly referred to as a \"Star Destroyer\", was the Harrower-class dreadnought of the resurgent Sith Empire. This design originated with Grand Moff Odile Vaiken as part of the Empire's military build-up in the 1,300 years that preceded the Great Galactic War.\nThese ships eventually fought in this 28-year long conflict against the Republic.Star Wars: The Old Republic\n\n\u2022 Clone Wars-developments\n\ncirca 22 BBY, was a proto Star-Destroyer.]]\nStar Destroyers that bore the distinctive wedge-shape, which came to be associated with the ship type, were in the service of the later Republic Navy around the time of the Clone Wars. The two most famous designs at the time were the Victory I- and Venator-classes, which were considered massive. Other Republic Star Destroyers, like the Imperator- and Tector-classes, became infamous for their service in the Imperial Navy. The new Star Destroyer designs were born from the success of the Acclamator-class assault ship.The New Essential Chronology In addition, then-Supreme Chancellor of the Republic and future Galactic Emperor Palpatine mentioned in his Sith compendium, the Book of Sith, that the Star Destroyers developed during this time also shared similarities with the Harrower-class dreadnought.Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side\n\n\u2022 Imperial and New Republic usage\n\nDuring the time of the Empire, many smaller and less independent dagger-shaped ships, such as the Immobilizer 418 cruiserThe Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels and the Broadside-class cruiser, were often compared to small Star Destroyers without being classified as one themselves. In the Broadside case, it was downgraded from Star Destroyer to cruiser, due to its lack of defensive power and mobility. In large part because of a Star Destroyers capabilities, Mon Mothma, the leader of the Rebel Alliance, noted that if the Empire fragmented after Endor, it would pose the risk of any Imperial commander with access to a Star Destroyer becoming a warlord.Star Wars: Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide\nWhile Star Destroyers served as the heaviest combatants in many fleets composed of frigates and down-scaled cruisers, they performed an escort role when in the presence of specialized battleships found in the Republic Navy, or larger Imperial warships such as the Executor-class. Star Wars: Complete Locations, p. 142\nBoth the Republic and the Empire maintained a higher-tier system of vessels heavier and more powerful than Star Destroyers, categorized from Battlecruisers to Star Dreadnoughts. Building on the popularity the Star Destroyers gained in the Clone Wars, and the name of the \"Super-class Star Destroyer,\"Starship Battles Preview 1 many of these heavy vessels were referred to in military colloquialism as \"Super Star Destroyers\" (sometimes omitting the \"Super\" prefix). The Imperial Navy had around 25,000 ISDs alone throughout its existence.\nThe New Republic also used the dagger-shape in their later Star Destroyer designs. However, not all vessels known as Star Destroyers adhered to the dagger aesthetic.Crackens Threat Dossier\ncirca 137 ABY.]]\nNotable Star Destroyer-manufacturers through the ages included Kuat Drive Yards,Dark Empire Sourcebook Rendili StarDrive, Imperial Sourcebook, p. 60 and the Republic Engineering Corporation.\n\n\u2022 Later iterations\n\nEven though the Galactic Alliance continued to use and produce Star Destroyers, they later decided to name their new ships \"battle carriers\" in order to avoid reminding people of the old Imperial terror symbols.Legacy of the Force: Betrayal By the time of the Sith\u2013Imperial War, the resurgent Empire utilized the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer, which was described as one of the largest and most powerful warships of its time, with unparallelled weapons-systems. The Sith Empire led by Darth Krayt later constructed the much bigger and heavily armed Imperious-class Star Destroyer, the Imperious, which was stolen by the Galactic Alliance Remnant led by Gar Stazi when it became operational.Star Wars: Legacy: Indomitable\n\n\u2022 Known designs\n\n\u2022 Aggressor-class Star Destroyer\n\nAggressor-class Star Destroyer\nThe Aggressor-class Star Destroyer was an experimental design, whose plans and prototype vessel were stolen by the Zann Consortium and modified. The Aggressor-class vessels went on to serve as one of the Consortium's most powerful capital ships.\n\n\u2022 Bakura-class destroyer\n\nBakura-class destroyer\nThe Bakura-class Star Destroyer was created by Bakura after the Invasion of Bakura in 4 ABY. It was built around an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer's annihilation reactor and was 850 meters long. Three destroyers participated in the Battle of Centerpoint Station in 18 ABY.\n\n\u2022 Chiss Star Destroyer\n\nChiss Star Destroyer\nChiss Star Destroyers were needle-shaped warships 1,000 meters long, built by the Chiss and armed with masers. They participated in the Swarm War against the Killiks in 36 ABY. The Empire of the Hand utilized Chiss Star Destroyers in the Battle over Exodo II in 44 ABY.\n\n\u2022 Gladiator-class Star Destroyer\n\nGladiator-class Star Destroyer/Legends\nThe Gladiator-class was a small Star Destroyer class used by the Galactic Empire to subjugate outlying systems and enforce order on Outer Rim worlds not justifying the need for larger vessels. It was 600 meters long, and had a large hangar area towards the front of the vessel, with a hangar bay opening at the bow.\n\n\u2022 Imperial-class Star Destroyer\n\nThe Imperial-class consisted of several Star Destroyer models built by Kuat Drive Yards over several decades.\n\n\u2022 Imperator/Imperial I-class Star Destroyer\n\nImperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends\nThe 1,600-meter-long Imperator-class was created early in the Clone Wars, but only saw widespread deployment after the rise of the Galactic Empire. Following the Great Jedi Purge, the class was renamed to Imperial, but the original name was used in some official documents. It came to symbolize the tyranny of Imperial rule and was used throughout the galaxy for many decades, even long after the fall of the Empire and the establishment of both the New Republic and later the Galactic Alliance, who appropriated many vessels and used them in their own navies.\n\n\u2022 Imperator II/Imperial II-class Star Destroyer\n\nImperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends\nThe Imperial II-class was fielded years after the first model, with some cosmetic differences. It became the norm for the Imperial Navy, with some Imperial Is retrofitted to be more similar to the second generation.\n\n\u2022 Imperious-class Star Destroyer\n\nImperious-class Star Destroyer\nThe Imperious-class Star Destroyer Imperious was built by the Mon Calamari Shipyards for Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire. It was later stolen by the Galactic Alliance Remnant upon completion and turned into their flagship.\n\n\u2022 Interdictor-class Star Destroyer\n\nInterdictor-class Star Destroyer/Legends\nThe 1,600-meter-long Interdictor-class Star Destroyer comprised several designs of Star Destroyers fitted with gravity well projectors based on the ones from the smaller Immobilizer 418 cruiser.\n\n\u2022 Nebula/Defender-class Star Destroyer\n\nNebula-class Star Destroyer\nThe Nebula-class, also known as Defender-class, was a class of expensive and powerful warships. They were only 1,040 meters long, but their firepower was strong enough to dominate any known Star Destroyer class at the time and could take on some Super Star Destroyers as well. While smaller than other Destroyers they were packed with armament, at the expense of crew endurance. Because of their power requirements, they were very expensive and had a relatively small production run. Despite this, they performed well as core fleets during the Yuuzhan Vong War.\n\n\u2022 Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer\n\n, Harrower-class dreadnought,\nVenator-class Star Destroyer and Imperial-class Star Destroyer before it, the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer was the mainstay capital ship of its era. It was fielded over 100 years after the destruction of the Death Star.]]\nPellaeon-class Star Destroyer\nThe Pellaeon-class was built over 100 years after the Battle of Endor and the beginning of the downfall of the first Galactic Empire. It was made by KDY for the Fel Empire, and was based on the Imperial-class and also incorporated some elements of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought. It later served as the signature vessel of Darth Krayt's Empire.\n\n\u2022 Procursator\n\nProcursator-class Star Destroyer\nThe Procursator-class was a class used by the Galactic Empire and the New Republic.\n\n\u2022 Providence-class carrier/destroyer\n\nProvidence-class carrier/destroyer/Legends\nThe Providence-class carrier/destroyer was a capital ship design used during the Clone Wars by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Some were identified under the name Separatist Star Destroyers.\n\n\u2022 Rejuvenator-class Star Destroyer\n\nRejuvenator-class Star Destroyer\nThe Rejuvenator-class was a class that fought during the tail-end of the Yuuzhan Vong War in 29 ABY.\n\n\u2022 Republic-class Star Destroyer\n\nRepublic-class Star Destroyer\nThe Republic-class had a long design phase, beginning as a new warship project early on in the New Republic but only fielded in limited amounts after Operation Shadow Hand. Ships were distributed to several task forces at some point before the Black Fleet Crisis. They were 1,250 meters long and despite being bigger than the Nebula-class, were weaker than them, being less powerful than an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer.\n\n\u2022 Secutor-class Star Destroyer\n\nSecutor-class Star Destroyer/Legends\nThe Secutor-class served the Galactic Empire at Naval Station Validusia and the Dark Empire at Byss as a support ship for the larger Imperial warships. Although its size technically qualified it under the Star Cruiser subclass of Star Battlecruiser under length requirements, its comparative lack of heavy armaments and carrier-like qualities had it retain the Star Destroyer classification.\n\n\u2022 Sorannan-class Star Destroyer\n\nSorannan-class Star Destroyer\nThe Sorannan-class was a weapons and engine testbed for the Galactic Empire. The only known representative of the class, the Rakehell, originally known as the EX-F, was attached to Black Sword Command before being captured during the Yevethan Uprising in 4 ABY. During the climax of the Black Fleet Crisis in 17 ABY, the captured Imperials of Camp Paaal Squadron seized control of the Black Fleet, including the EX-F, and fled to the Deep Core. Upon learning of the destruction of Byss six years earlier, Camp Paaal Squadron scattered, with the newly renamed Rakehell ending up in the Outer Rim, and ultimately being destroyed during the Battle of Anx Minor later that year.\n\n\u2022 Tector-class Star Destroyer\n\nTector-class Star Destroyer\nThe 1,600 meter Tector-class was a hangarless design that was built during the Clone Wars, but only widely fielded during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Like the Imperial-class, it saw service for decades.\n\n\u2022 Turbulent-class Star Destroyer\n\nTurbulent-class Star Destroyer\nThe Turbulent-class was a small type of Star Destroyer built by the Imperial Remnant in 40 ABY and was fielded towards the end of the Second Galactic Civil War.\n\n\u2022 Venator-class Star Destroyer\n\nVenator-class Star Destroyer/Legends\nThe Venator-class was 1,137 meters long, and had the dual role of warship and carrier during the Clone Wars. They served as Jedi flagships during the Wars, and were thus heavily linked to them, leading to their gradual abandonment by the Galactic Empire. Their other weakness was long hangar bay doors, which were vulnerable while opening and closing.\n\n\u2022 Victory-class Star Destroyer\n\nThe Victory-class consisted of several Star Destroyer models initially built by Rendili StarDrive during the Clone Wars.\n\n\u2022 Victory I-class Star Destroyer\n\nVictory I-class Star Destroyer/Legends\nThe Victory I was rushed out of development as part of the Victor Initiative Project between KDY and Rendili StarDrive. They were 900 meters long and were not as well-made as other Star Destroyer designs, despite early successful campaigns like the hunt for the Bulwark Fleet during the Clone Wars. The Victory-class still managed to serve for many decades and for successive galactic governments despite its flaws.\n\n\u2022 Victory II-class Star Destroyer\n\nVictory II-class Star Destroyer/Legends\nThe Victory II-class was made right after the establishment of the Galactic Empire, and was produced in even fewer numbers than the Victory I.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\n]]\nIn The Star Wars: Rough Draft, a Stardestroyer is a small, two-man craft. The final film used this term for large capital ships, and all contemporaneous written sources spelled it as two words. Nonetheless, the subtitles on the The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi DVDs transcribed the term as \"stardestroyer.\"\nThe sounds for the Star Destroyer came from a broken air conditioner in a hotel room in White Sands Proving Range, New Mexico. Sounds from the Goodyear blimp were mixed in to create the iconic rumble of a Star Destroyer.The Sounds of Star Wars\nAccording to Star Wars and History, Star Destroyers were comparable to the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, which dropped more bombs during the Vietnam War than all the bombs dropped during World War II.\nOn the commentary track of the Revenge of the Sith DVD, George Lucas referred to General Grievouss ship, a Providence-class carrier/destroyer, as a \"Star Destroyer.\" This might mean that the term \"Star Destroyer\" is not supposed to be restricted to dagger-shaped warships, which fits with the existence of the Bakura'-class. Or this might have been just a generalization.\nThe term \"Star Destroyer\" is used both for different classes of destroyers and as a general term for most dagger-shaped warships in use by the Empire, from smaller frigates like the Demolisher to giant dreadnoughts like the Executor and the Eclipse. This has created some ambiguity, as many sources describe ships only as a \"Star Destroyer\" or \"Imperial Star Destroyer.\" Since many stories have historically focused on the 1,600-meter-long Imperial-class, it is used as a default reference unless stated otherwise.\nIn the endnotes for The Essential Guide to Warfare, Jason Fry mentioned that he initially had trouble coming up with a class for the various Star Destroyers, until he eventually settled on making Star Destroyer a ship class, due to it being used synonymously with a big capital ship, which likewise implied a ship class.\nLego has released a set featuring the Star Destroyer. It includes stormtroopers, Darth Vader, R2-Q5, Grand Moff Tarkin, Imperial Officers, and Royal Guards.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game\n\n\u2022 The Return of Tag & Bink: Special Edition\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\n\n\u2022 Soulcalibur IV as the Star Destroyer Docking Bay\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Visions of the Blade\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 film\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 game\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: Bombad Bounty\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStay on Target]]\n\u2022 Lords of Nal Hutta\n\n\u2022 Fly Casual\n\n\u2022 Strongholds of Resistance\n\n\u2022 Keeping the Peace\n\n\u2022 Forged in Battle\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",

Large ships fought in the [[Alsakan Conflicts/Legends|Alsakan Conflicts]] and the [[Old Sith Wars]]. They became obsolete at some point after [[3000 BBY]], when fleet doctrine shifted to groups of smaller-scale [[Cruiser/Legends|cruisers]] that combined their firepower and were more maneuverable. These new designs were armed with better weapons and more powerful shields than the older [[Battlecruiser/Legends|battlecruisers]] and [[Battleship/Legends|battleships]].<ref name=\"HSATCSS\">''[[Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, by the centuries prior to the Clone Wars, heavy warships had gained prominence again. The first modern design that would be lumped into the Super Star Destroyer category was the ''Procurator''-class Star Battlecruiser, built two centuries before the Clone Wars. It spawned a series of increasingly large warship designs and went on to have many different models in its own production line.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nLarge vessels like the ''Procurator'' were used for generations by private defensive fleets fielded by rich, industrialized star sectors.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /><ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> [[Kuat sector/Legends|Kuat]], [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellia]], and [[Humbarine sector/Legends|Humbarine]] were but three of the industrialized Core sectors that could afford to build such behemoths, which were fitted with [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrives]] with limited range to highlight their defensive purposes in the relative peace of the time.<ref name=\"AOTC:ICS\">''[[Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref>\n\nWhile a member of the [[Techno Union/Legends|Techno Union]], the shipyards of Kuat began to experiment further in this period with warship designs that eclipsed previous generations.<ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> Two decades prior to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the shipyard unveiled the ''Mandator''-class, a type of design that would fill out the modern dreadnought category in the Anaxes War College System.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\n[[File:Imperial-Star-Cruiser.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Bellator-class dreadnought/Legends|''Bellator''-class dreadnought]] orbiting [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]]]]\nDuring the Clone Wars, heavy warship classes like the Star Battlecruisers and Star Dreadnoughts were used by the resurgent [[Republic Navy/Legends|Republic Navy]],<ref name=\"ROTS:ICS\">''[[Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref> as large defense vessels.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /> Some battlecruisers were refitted to lead task forces on raids deep into Separatist territory.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of the wars, the newly created Galactic Empire began an unprecedented research and development program for a new generation of heavy warship designs,<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /><ref name=\"DOD\">''[[Dawn of Defiance]]''</ref> creating vessels that would bear the colloquial term Super Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nSuper Star Destroyer production was sometimes helped along by innovations in other areas. The Clone Wars saw the development of the [[Cardan-class space station|''Cardan''-class space station series]], which came to have some influence on the structuring of future naval projects, including the Super Star Destroyers and the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[Battle station/Legends|battle stations]].<ref name=\"MTS2\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/Mesop2|text=Message to Spacers 2}}</ref>\n\nA few months after the end of the Clone Wars, the [[Sarlacc Project]] was begun. It sought to develop a new, heavy Imperial [[Super Star Destroyer prototype|command ship]]. This vessel, an early prototype for a new generation of dreadnoughts, was 12 kilometers in length and meant to be filled with weapons. It was destroyed by early rebel elements before it could be completed.<ref name=\"DOD\" />\nDespite such an early setback, larger and more refined Star Dreadnought designs were eventually produced, notably the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class]]<ref name=\"SBP1\">''Starship Battles Preview 1''</ref> and [[Eclipse-class dreadnought|''Eclipse''-class]].<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /><ref name=\"SW:EAW:FOC\">''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption]]''</ref>\n\nThe ''Executor''-class became a highly sought after command ship, and the creation of the lead vessel and other members of the class was mired by political intrigue and misinformation campaigns.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /> When the Imperial Navy requested funds for construction of the ''Executor'', it forged a profile on the vessel, calling it a ''Super''-class Star Destroyer and making it out to be less than half its intended size, on par with the earlier ''Mandator''- and ''Mandator II''-classes.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /> This was done to avoid arousing suspicion in the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]] about the true nature of the design<ref name=\"ISB\" /><ref name=\"SBP1\" /> as well as to capitalize on the popularity of the dagger-shaped Star Destroyer class, which dated back to the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"SOTGSE\" /><ref name=\"SSD:DB\">''Super Star Destroyer'' in the Databank</ref> The Emperor's ultimate plan for these vessels was to have one Super Star Destroyer per sector, to serve as a command ship for Imperial forces stationed at the sector.<ref name=\"Handbook\" />\n\nThe term was shortened to \"Super Star Destroyer,\" and both it and the fake designation of ''Super''-class remained in colloquial use long after the real name and designation had been revealed and the first vessel made operational.<ref name=\"DTII:R\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref><ref name=\"DNIII:TSW\">''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]''</ref><ref name=\"Fn\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''</ref>\n\nAs these vessels came to play a greater role in naval doctrine, some officers and military planners derided the battlecruisers and dreadnoughts as a wasteful budgetary expense. They derisively referred to all the designs as Super Star Destroyers and argued that vessels at Star Destroyer scale and smaller were the only things needed to keep the Empire safe. With the advent and subsequent destruction of the first Death Star, the Navy reluctantly adopted SSDs as a viable and cheaper alternative. Due to their increased effectiveness as terror weapons, dreadnought production was prioritized over battlecruiser designs.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nBattlecruisers like the ''Praetor''-class survived the transition into the Galactic Empire, but continued in limited service during the Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> Battlecruisers were hampered by their relative inflexibility compared to Star Destroyers and the lack of heavier firepower compared to the dreadnought models.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /> The ''Praetor''-class, for one, was considered outright outdated.<ref name=\"TCSWE\" />\n\n\"Super Star Destroyer\" and \"''Super''-class\" later carried over to other warship designs in the following decades, with even the Rebel Alliance referring to anything bigger than a Star Destroyer by these terms.<ref name=\"SW:CL\" /><ref name=\"SBP1\" /><ref name=\"SSD:DB\" /><ref name=\"GWP\">''Gravity well projector'' in the Databank</ref> Beyond the colloquialisms, many SSDs were referred to as \"star dreadnoughts\" as well, contrasting the usage of \"star cruiser\" (lowercase) to refer to Star Destroyers.<ref name=\"SOTGSE\" />\n\n===Early Imperial production===\n[[File:BigTim-FactFile.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Intimidator (Executor-class)|''Intimidator'']] was one of the later-generation ''Executor''s.]]\nBefore the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], most Super Star Destroyer dreadnought production lines were still undergoing construction,<ref name=\"DSn\">[[Death Star (novel)|''Death Star'']]</ref> and the few partially constructed ships were only used as command centers<ref name=\"SW:EAW:FOC\" /><ref name=\"TFU\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]''</ref> At least one Super Star Destroyer was also put in dry dock in the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first]] [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] some time before its [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction]] in [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]].\n\nOnce the Empire realized the threat posed by an organized rebellion with the downfall of the first Death Star, the Super Star Destroyers began to be mass-produced, with an average [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] or [[Sector Group Commander]] estimated to have one or more such superweapons in their arsenal throughout the course of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], bringing the total number of ships up to thousands.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\nThe ''Executor''-class alone was believed to have had over 20 ships to its name, their combined bulk equating to that of thousands of individual Star Destroyers. Such heavy warships served both as sector as well as regional command centers<ref name=\"TEC\">[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]</ref> with individual ships kept off the records as black projects, sent into the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] for secret missions, or stationed at hidden sites as additional assets.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nIn addition to mass-production, influential individuals could afford customized designs at the height of the Empire. The [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] and [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitor]] [[Jerec (Inquisitor)|Jerec]] had [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]] build a grandiose [[Vengeance (Vengeance-class)|flagship]] for himself, replacing his ''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer as a sign of his growing ambitions.<ref name=\"TDFS\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050407a|text=The Dark Forces Saga, Part 1|int=The Dark Forces Saga}}</ref> This vessel became the lead ship of [[Vengeance-class dreadnought|its own class]] of dreadnoughts in addition to other dreadnought designs being produced during this period.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nOverall, despite consisting of several classes with multiple models in each category, each Super Star Destroyer production line was relatively short, compared to the prolific Star Destroyers.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\nThere were still enough active ships around the time of the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]] to make Rebel personnel also refer to them by the general term of Super Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"SW:CL\" /><ref name=\"ITW:OT\">''[[Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy]]''</ref>\n\nWhile conventional armaments were designed for most ships, the two ''Eclipse''-class dreadnoughts had a [[Superlaser/Legends|superlaser]] as their primary weapon. The bulk of these two ''Super''-class Star Destroyers<ref name=\"DB\">{{DB|technology|gravitywellprojector|gravity well projector}}</ref> was built around each ship's reactor and support systems, making them the most powerful conventional warships in history, and causing the design to attract unwanted attention from criminal third parties.<ref name=\"U:AGOSAV\">{{InsiderCite|89|Underworld: A Galaxy of Scum and Villainy}}</ref>\n\nTheir construction took almost over a decade, with the Emperor's downfall leading to delays and shifts in logistics. They were estimated to be powerful enough to allow whoever controlled them a real chance at taking power in the galaxy. This also made them high-profile targets by both the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and, later, the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].<ref name=\"SOTGSE\" />\nAs a symbol of its status, the ''Eclipse'' was escorted by [[Allegiance-class battlecruiser|smaller Super Star Destroyers]] during the [[Battle of Pinnacle Base]].<ref name=\"DEI\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]''</ref><ref name=\"SW:DEa\">[[Dark Empire (audio drama)|''Dark Empire'' audio drama]]</ref>\n\n===After Endor===\n[[File:Vengeance.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The SSD [[Vengeance (Vengeance-class)|''Vengeance'']], c.

Despite dozens of active [[Battle group/Legends|battle groups]] being led by SSDs immediately after [[Endor/Legends|Endor]],<ref name=\"SOTGSE\" /> the lack of cooperation between various parts of the Empire and the gradual rise to power of the New Republic led to many Super Star Destroyers being destroyed or captured.<ref name=\"SOTGSE\" />\n\nThe focus switched to Star Destroyers or smaller vessels for the various Imperial [[Warlord/Legends|warlords]]. Former support ships like the [[Strike-class medium cruiser|''Strike''-class medium cruiser]] saw a renewed service period as more mainline warships in the fleets of the [[Imperial Remnant]].<ref name=\"SOTGSE\" />\n\n[[File:Eclipse1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Palpatine's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Eclipse (Eclipse-class)|''Eclipse'']], accompanied by several smaller [[Allegiance-class battlecruiser|battlecruisers]], in orbit above [[Da Soocha V|Pinnacle Moon]]]]\nThe last major SSD known to have been commissioned by legitimate Imperial forces was an ''Executor''-class ship known as the ''[[Razor's Kiss]]''.

By the time Grand Admiral [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] took command of the Empire five years after Endor, his naval forces could not gain access to anything bigger than individual Star Destroyers.<ref name=\"TTT\">''[[Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy]]''</ref> Even warlords who kept diplomatic relations with Thrawn were hesitant to throw their dreadnoughts in with his forces.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nConcurrent with the warlordism, some fleet elements were recalled to the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]], where scores of heavy warships became part of the \"[[Dark Empire]]\" ruled over by the clones of [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Here, the resurrected Emperor plotted their use as tools of conquest for six years after Endor, unleashing them alongside his fleets of [[World Devastator]]s during the attempt at regaining his former glory with [[Operation Shadow Hand]] in [[10 ABY/Legends|10]] and [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]].<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /><ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\nPrior to this operation, this Dark Empire retook large portions of the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], beginning a vicious [[Imperial Civil War]] in the aftermath of the retaking of Coruscant from the New Republic. Twelve Super Star Destroyers were destroyed in the infighting, including the [[Mandator III-class dreadnought|''Mandator III''-class]] dreadnoughts ''[[Aculeus]]'' and ''[[Panthac]]'' and the ''Executor''-class dreadnought ''[[Whelm]]''.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /> (And a few other Super Star Destroyers including these following classes of Super Star Destroyers, ''Vengeance''-class dreadnoughts ''Executor''-class dreadnoughts [[Mandator III-class dreadnought|''Mandator III''-class]]-class dreadnoughts)\n\nDuring the rise of the resurrected Palpatine, at least four 15-kilometer-long ''Sovereign''-class Super Star Destroyers underwent construction, while the two ''Eclipse''-class vessels were completed and fielded. These six vessels were meant to be the beginning of a new era of superlaser-armed warships, but with the destruction of [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] and the final death of the Emperor, they were all destroyed.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\n[[File:Sovereign_star_dreadnought.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A [[Sovereign-class Super Star Destroyer|''Sovereign''-class]] profile]]\nThe power having shifted to the New Republic, the threat of SSDs decreased. Despite this, the Republic constructed a counterpart to the Empire's Super Star Destroyers, with the Mon Calamari&ndash;produced [[Viscount-class Star Defender|''Viscount''-class Star Defender]] and [[Mediator-class battle cruiser|''Mediator''-class battle cruiser]] filling holes in the Republic's naval forces.<ref name=\"VP\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]''</ref>\n\nApart from the Republic's new designs, several SSDs remained in the hands of foreign powers. One eight-kilometer-long SSD was observed in the fleet of the [[Imperial Remnant]] during the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Yuuzhan Vong War|invasion]]<ref name=\"DW\" /> and at least one ''Executor'' was part of rogue Imperial pirate forces just prior to the start of this conflict.<ref name=\"RRmbs\">WOTC's ''Rebel Raiders'' modified battle scenario</ref>\n\n===Further service===\n[[File:Allegianceblow.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Allegiance (Allegiance-class)|''Allegiance'']], a Super Star Destroyer battlecruiser, is destroyed while serving in a command role during the [[Battle of Calamari]] in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]].]]\nDuring the events surrounding the [[Swarm War]], the ''[[Megador]]'', a Super Star Destroyer equipped with sixteen [[Engine/Legends|engines]], was used as flagship for the then-supreme commander of the [[Galactic Alliance Defense Force]], [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]].<ref name=\"DNIII:TSW\" />\n\nSuper Star Destroyers were known to be used in the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], with the ''Megador''<ref name=\"I\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''</ref> and the [[Dominion (Star Dreadnought)|''Dominion'']]<ref name=\"Inv\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref> participating on the side of [[Darth Caedus]]'s faction of the Galactic Alliance.\nAt some point following the Second Galactic Civil War, heavy warships like the [[Star Defender]]s and Star Dreadnoughts were phased out of service, citing the expenses in operating the various designs.<ref name=\"LECG\">''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nBy [[130 ABY]], the main-line [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer]] had some of its systems partially based on achievements made with the successful ''Executor''-class.<ref name=\"SOTGSE\" /> The larger [[Imperious-class Star Destroyer|''Imperious''-class Star Destroyer]] was based on the ''Pellaeon'' and had a larger frame than the standard Star Destroyer classes of previous generations, but still shared their designation<ref name=\"LECG\" /> rather than be rated a battlecruiser or a dreadnought.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\n==Designs==\n===''Allegiance''-class battlecruiser===\n[[File:ByssAllegiance-DEII3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 2,200-meter ''Allegiance''-class]]\n{{Main|Allegiance-class battlecruiser}}\nThe 2,200 meter ''Allegiance''-class design was a typical example of the Star Cruiser subclass of battlecruisers.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /> ''Allegiance''s were smaller Super Star Destroyers seen in use as escorts for larger vessels like the ''Eclipse''-class. They had a design reminiscent of the ''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer, only larger.<ref name=\"SW:DEa\" /> The class had a ventrally protruding reactor core and no visible launch bay.<ref name=\"DEI\" />\n\n===The ''Aramadia''===\n[[File:Aramadia_SSD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 3,200+ meter ''Aramadia'']]\n{{Main|Aramadia (Super Star Destroyer)}}\nThe ''Aramadia'' was an Imperial SSD that was captured by the [[Yevetha]]ns and acted as one of [[Nil Spaar]]'s [[Flagship/Legends|flagships]] during the [[Yevethan Purge]] in [[16 ABY/Legends|16]]-[[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]]. Following the [[Battle of N'zoth]] and the end of the Purge, it was towed to [[N'zoth]] and used as a museum.

The design was very sleek compared to other Super Star Destroyers (similar only to [[Vengeance (Vengeance-class)|Jerec's ship]]), and noteworthy for a large quadruple tower structure protruding from the dorsal and ventral side in the general area of the bridge structure. Dorsal bays could launch the ship's complement of [[Dark Trooper/Legends|Dark troopers]] onto a target in a combat drop. The ''Arc Hammer'' was destroyed from within by [[Kyle Katarn]]'s sabotage.<ref name=\"SW:DF\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces]]''</ref>\n\n===''Assertor''-class Star Dreadnought===\n[[File:Assertor_Insider134.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 15,000-meter ''Assertor''-class]]\n{{Main|Assertor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends}}\nThe 15,000 meter ''Assertor''-class Star Dreadnought was a heavily armed Imperial Star Dreadnought. Ships of this class sometimes led elite units that used [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter/Legends|TIE/D Defender]] starfighter squadrons. Two were seen at [[Naval Station Validusia/Legends|Naval Station ''Validusia'']].\n\n===''Bellator''-class dreadnought===\n[[File:Bellator-class_Star_Battlecruiser.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 7,200-meter ''Bellator''-class]]\n{{Main|Bellator-class dreadnought/Legends}}\nThe 7,200 meter ''Bellator''-class dreadnought was based on the earlier Mandator and Mandator II dreadnought models and was a slightly scaled down version of them. Several vessels were seen at [[Naval Station Validusia/Legends|Naval Station ''Validusia'']]. Two ''Bellator''s were viewed by the commanders of Death Squadron at a fleet gathering prior to the Battle of Hoth.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /> At least one vessel later served in the forces of the resurrected Emperor Palpatine in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]]. A ''Bellator'' was escorted by a [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] in orbit of Byss around this time.<ref name=\"DEI\" />\n\n===''Eclipse''-class dreadnought===\n[[File:Eclipse_schem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 17,500-meter ''Eclipse''-class]]\n{{Main|Eclipse-class dreadnought}}\nThe ''Eclipse''-class was designed as flagships for [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] and were constructed in relative secrecy. They were 17.5 kilometers in length, with much of their interiors taken up by generators used to power the ship's main weapon, a scaled-down [[Superlaser/Legends|superlaser]]. The class's design was meant to evoke ancient seagoing warships.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\n===''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought===\n[[File:Executor-CHRON.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 19,000-meter ''Executor''-class]]\n{{Main|Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends}}\nThe ''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought was the first class associated with the SSD moniker.<ref name=\"ISB\" /> It was 19 kilometers in length, was powered by a central reactor underneath its command tower, had over 5,000 various weapons-systems,<ref name=\"SW:CL\" /> and could carry over a thousand starfighters in its multiple hangar bays.<ref name=\"Darksaber\" /> Its design was meant to overwhelm any opposition, sending the enemy into retreat or resignation by its mere presence.<ref name=\"ISB\" /> The class became popular within the Imperial Navy, and officers desired such ships as a status symbol.<ref name=\"CTD\">''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''</ref> Since the ''Super''-class designation originated with this ship, it was often called ''Super''-class Star Destroyer interchangeably with other terms.<ref name=\"ISB\" /><ref name=\"SOTGSE\" /><ref name=\"SOTEn\">[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (novel)|''Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire'' novel]]</ref><ref name=\"TBFC\">''[[The Black Fleet Crisis]]''</ref>\n\n===''Mandator II''-class Star Dreadnaught===\n{{Main|Mandator II-class Star Dreadnaught/Legends}}\nThe 8,000-meter ''Mandator II''-class Star Dreadnaught was built and fielded by KDY and the Galactic Republic.

Like the ''Eclipse'', the ''Sovereign'' was armed with a superlaser as its primary weapon. None of the four initial ships survived the fall of the resurrected Palpatine, and all were destroyed before completion.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\n===Super Star Destroyer prototype===\n[[File:Sarlaccproject.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 12,000-meter ''Super Star Destroyer prototype'']]\n{{Main|Super Star Destroyer prototype}}\nThis ship, developed in the [[Sarlacc Project]], was 12 kilometers long, had a central reactor, and was meant to be covered in armaments and serve as the Imperial Navy's symbolic flagship. It was destroyed while partially unfinished during the [[Battle of Byss]]. Despite its destruction, it served as a precursor to later classes, like the ''Executor''.<ref name=\"DOD\" />\n\n===''Vengeance''-class dreadnought===\n[[File:Vengeanceabove.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 19,000-meter ''Vengeance''-class]]\n{{Main|Vengeance-class dreadnought}}\nThis 19,000-meter dreadnought model was used by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].

In extreme cases, they were large enough to qualify as space stations.\nIt was often used concurrently with the term Super-class Star Destroyer, both of which capitalized on the general \"Star Destroyer\" term, which, after getting popular exposure throughout the Clone Wars, came to symbolize weapons that in people's minds could destroy entire star systems.\nDarth Vaders command ship, the Executor, was a Super Star Destroyer and one of the most famous Imperial vessels fielded, as was the even deadlier Eclipse, which served as one of Emperor Palpatines flagships.\n\n\u2022 Characteristics\n\ns fan out from the Deep Core during Operation Shadow Hand in 10 ABY.]]\nThe term \"Super Star Destroyer\" described some of the largest warships ever designed and fielded, and covered various warship classes that served primarily as command ships. All the known models were at least several kilometers long in order to support their increasingly heavy power generators and armaments. In at least one ship classification system, SSDs were regarded as large enough to be counted as space stations rather than regular starships.Starships of the Galaxy In large part due to their immense size, Super Star Destroyers required a crew of at least 280,000 to operate. One of the leaders of the Rebel Alliance, Mon Mothma, admitted when learning this that it would pose a dilemma if the Rebel Alliance did manage to capture one intact: they wouldnt have enough personnel to operate it.Star Wars: Imperial Handbook: A Commanders Guide\nThe largest known models were usually fitted with extensive command and control suites which could handle far more naval forces than previous command stations, such as the Old Republics Republic command ships of the Krath Holy CrusadeTales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 2 or the Inexpugnable-class tactical command ships of the Mandalorian Wars.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook'\nLike most other starship production lines, different ships within the same class were often subject to different specifications in terms of armament, crew and support vessels, based on their intended focus and roles.\nSuper Star Destroyers were on par with or larger than most other navies ships-of-the-line, like the Trade Federations Lucrehulk-class battleships or the Subjugator-class heavy cruisers of the CIS.The Clone Wars Campaign Guide\nAs command ships, SSDs like the Executor-class were capable of projecting power across entire Oversectors and served as command ships for galaxy-spanning campaigns. They were good expressions of the Tarkin Doctrine, which argued that galactic peace could be achieved by developing the ability to project overwhelming firepower against any enemy, rendering all resistance futile before it even began.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Origin\n\nArhul Hextrophon, on the Empire's obsession with super weapons\nFor tens of thousands of years, heavy warships were part of the Republic Navys strategy for space combat. Large ships fought in the Alsakan Conflicts and the Old Sith Wars. They became obsolete at some point after 3000 BBY, when fleet doctrine shifted to groups of smaller-scale cruisers that combined their firepower and were more maneuverable. These new designs were armed with better weapons and more powerful shields than the older battlecruisers and battleships.Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook'\nHowever, by the centuries prior to the Clone Wars, heavy warships had gained prominence again. The first modern design that would be lumped into the Super Star Destroyer category was the Procurator-class Star Battlecruiser, built two centuries before the Clone Wars. It spawned a series of increasingly large warship designs and went on to have many different models in its own production line.\nLarge vessels like the Procurator were used for generations by private defensive fleets fielded by rich, industrialized star sectors. Kuat, Corellia, and Humbarine were but three of the industrialized Core sectors that could afford to build such behemoths, which were fitted with hyperdrives with limited range to highlight their defensive purposes in the relative peace of the time.Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Incredible Cross-Sections\nWhile a member of the Techno Union, the shipyards of Kuat began to experiment further in this period with warship designs that eclipsed previous generations. Two decades prior to the Clone Wars, the shipyard unveiled the Mandator-class, a type of design that would fill out the modern dreadnought category in the Anaxes War College System.\norbiting Byss in 10 ABY]]\nDuring the Clone Wars, heavy warship classes like the Star Battlecruisers and Star Dreadnoughts were used by the resurgent Republic Navy,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections as large defense vessels. Some battlecruisers were refitted to lead task forces on raids deep into Separatist territory.\nIn the aftermath of the wars, the newly created Galactic Empire began an unprecedented research and development program for a new generation of heavy warship designs,Dawn of Defiance creating vessels that would bear the colloquial term Super Star Destroyer.\nSuper Star Destroyer production was sometimes helped along by innovations in other areas. The Clone Wars saw the development of the Cardan-class space station series, which came to have some influence on the structuring of future naval projects, including the Super Star Destroyers and the Death Star battle stations.\nA few months after the end of the Clone Wars, the Sarlacc Project was begun. It sought to develop a new, heavy Imperial command ship. This vessel, an early prototype for a new generation of dreadnoughts, was 12 kilometers in length and meant to be filled with weapons. It was destroyed by early rebel elements before it could be completed.\nDespite such an early setback, larger and more refined Star Dreadnought designs were eventually produced, notably the Executor-classStarship Battles Preview 1 and Eclipse-class.Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption\nThe Executor-class became a highly sought after command ship, and the creation of the lead vessel and other members of the class was mired by political intrigue and misinformation campaigns. When the Imperial Navy requested funds for construction of the Executor, it forged a profile on the vessel, calling it a Super-class Star Destroyer and making it out to be less than half its intended size, on par with the earlier Mandator- and Mandator II-classes. This was done to avoid arousing suspicion in the Imperial Senate about the true nature of the design as well as to capitalize on the popularity of the dagger-shaped Star Destroyer class, which dated back to the Clone Wars.Super Star Destroyer in the Databank The Emperor's ultimate plan for these vessels was to have one Super Star Destroyer per sector, to serve as a command ship for Imperial forces stationed at the sector.\nThe term was shortened to \"Super Star Destroyer,\" and both it and the fake designation of Super-class remained in colloquial use long after the real name and designation had been revealed and the first vessel made operational.The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: RuinDark Nest III: The Swarm WarLegacy of the Force: Fury\nAs these vessels came to play a greater role in naval doctrine, some officers and military planners derided the battlecruisers and dreadnoughts as a wasteful budgetary expense. They derisively referred to all the designs as Super Star Destroyers and argued that vessels at Star Destroyer scale and smaller were the only things needed to keep the Empire safe. With the advent and subsequent destruction of the first Death Star, the Navy reluctantly adopted SSDs as a viable and cheaper alternative. Due to their increased effectiveness as terror weapons, dreadnought production was prioritized over battlecruiser designs.\nBattlecruisers like the Praetor-class survived the transition into the Galactic Empire, but continued in limited service during the Galactic Civil War. Battlecruisers were hampered by their relative inflexibility compared to Star Destroyers and the lack of heavier firepower compared to the dreadnought models. The Praetor-class, for one, was considered outright outdated.\n\"Super Star Destroyer\" and \"Super-class\" later carried over to other warship designs in the following decades, with even the Rebel Alliance referring to anything bigger than a Star Destroyer by these terms.Gravity well projector in the Databank Beyond the colloquialisms, many SSDs were referred to as \"star dreadnoughts\" as well, contrasting the usage of \"star cruiser\" (lowercase) to refer to Star Destroyers.\n\n\u2022 Early Imperial production\n\nwas one of the later-generation Executors.]]\nBefore the Battle of Yavin, most Super Star Destroyer dreadnought production lines were still undergoing construction,Death Star and the few partially constructed ships were only used as command centersStar Wars: The Force Unleashed At least one Super Star Destroyer was also put in dry dock in the first Death Star some time before its destruction in 0 ABY.\nOnce the Empire realized the threat posed by an organized rebellion with the downfall of the first Death Star, the Super Star Destroyers began to be mass-produced, with an average Moff or Sector Group Commander estimated to have one or more such superweapons in their arsenal throughout the course of the Galactic Civil War, bringing the total number of ships up to thousands.\nThe Executor-class alone was believed to have had over 20 ships to its name, their combined bulk equating to that of thousands of individual Star Destroyers. Such heavy warships served both as sector as well as regional command centersThe Essential Chronology with individual ships kept off the records as black projects, sent into the Unknown Regions for secret missions, or stationed at hidden sites as additional assets.\nIn addition to mass-production, influential individuals could afford customized designs at the height of the Empire. The Dark Jedi and Inquisitor Jerec had Kuat Drive Yards build a grandiose flagship for himself, replacing his Imperial-class Star Destroyer as a sign of his growing ambitions. This vessel became the lead ship of its own class of dreadnoughts in addition to other dreadnought designs being produced during this period.\nOverall, despite consisting of several classes with multiple models in each category, each Super Star Destroyer production line was relatively short, compared to the prolific Star Destroyers.\nThere were still enough active ships around the time of the Battle of Hoth to make Rebel personnel also refer to them by the general term of Super Star Destroyer.Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy\nWhile conventional armaments were designed for most ships, the two Eclipse-class dreadnoughts had a superlaser as their primary weapon. The bulk of these two Super-class Star Destroyersgravity well projector was built around each ship's reactor and support systems, making them the most powerful conventional warships in history, and causing the design to attract unwanted attention from criminal third parties.\nTheir construction took almost over a decade, with the Emperor's downfall leading to delays and shifts in logistics. They were estimated to be powerful enough to allow whoever controlled them a real chance at taking power in the galaxy. This also made them high-profile targets by both the Rebel Alliance and, later, the New Republic.\nAs a symbol of its status, the Eclipse was escorted by smaller Super Star Destroyers during the Battle of Pinnacle Base.Star Wars: Dark EmpireDark Empire audio drama\n\n\u2022 After Endor\n\n, c. 5 ABY]]\nFollowing the Empire's collapse as a result of the Battle of Endor, it became increasingly difficult to maintain gargantuan warships, with the gradual breakdown and fracture of the Galactic Empire. Despite dozens of active battle groups being led by SSDs immediately after Endor, the lack of cooperation between various parts of the Empire and the gradual rise to power of the New Republic led to many Super Star Destroyers being destroyed or captured.\nThe focus switched to Star Destroyers or smaller vessels for the various Imperial warlords. Former support ships like the Strike-class medium cruiser saw a renewed service period as more mainline warships in the fleets of the Imperial Remnant.\n, the Eclipse', accompanied by several smaller battlecruisers, in orbit above Pinnacle Moon]]\nThe last major SSD known to have been commissioned by legitimate Imperial forces was an Executor-class ship known as the Razor's Kiss. She was, however, destroyed by the New Republic soon after her launch from Kuat in 7.5 ABY.X-Wing: Iron Fist\nOver the years, the number of Super Star Destroyers dwindled as the older ships left in service were destroyed, captured, or kept in isolated Imperial enclaves. By the time Grand Admiral Thrawn took command of the Empire five years after Endor, his naval forces could not gain access to anything bigger than individual Star Destroyers.Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy Even warlords who kept diplomatic relations with Thrawn were hesitant to throw their dreadnoughts in with his forces.\nConcurrent with the warlordism, some fleet elements were recalled to the Deep Core, where scores of heavy warships became part of the \"Dark Empire\" ruled over by the clones of Palpatine. Here, the resurrected Emperor plotted their use as tools of conquest for six years after Endor, unleashing them alongside his fleets of World Devastators during the attempt at regaining his former glory with Operation Shadow Hand in 10 and 11 ABY.\nPrior to this operation, this Dark Empire retook large portions of the Core Worlds, beginning a vicious Imperial Civil War in the aftermath of the retaking of Coruscant from the New Republic. Twelve Super Star Destroyers were destroyed in the infighting, including the Mandator III-class dreadnoughts Aculeus and Panthac and the Executor-class dreadnought Whelm. (And a few other Super Star Destroyers including these following classes of Super Star Destroyers, Vengeance-class dreadnoughts Executor-class dreadnoughts Mandator III-class-class dreadnoughts)\nDuring the rise of the resurrected Palpatine, at least four 15-kilometer-long Sovereign-class Super Star Destroyers underwent construction, while the two Eclipse-class vessels were completed and fielded. These six vessels were meant to be the beginning of a new era of superlaser-armed warships, but with the destruction of Byss and the final death of the Emperor, they were all destroyed.\nprofile]]\nThe power having shifted to the New Republic, the threat of SSDs decreased. Despite this, the Republic constructed a counterpart to the Empires Super Star Destroyers, with the Mon Calamari&ndash;produced Viscount-class Star Defender and Mediator-class battle cruiser filling holes in the Republics naval forces.The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime\nApart from the Republics new designs, several SSDs remained in the hands of foreign powers. One eight-kilometer-long SSD was observed in the fleet of the Imperial Remnant during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion and at least one Executor was part of rogue Imperial pirate forces just prior to the start of this conflict.WOTCs Rebel Raiders modified battle scenario\n\n\u2022 Further service\n\n, a Super Star Destroyer battlecruiser, is destroyed while serving in a command role during the Battle of Calamari in 10 ABY.]]\nDuring the events surrounding the Swarm War, the Megador, a Super Star Destroyer equipped with sixteen engines, was used as flagship for the then-supreme commander of the Galactic Alliance Defense Force, Gilad Pellaeon.\nSuper Star Destroyers were known to be used in the Second Galactic Civil War, with the MegadorLegacy of the Force: Inferno and the DominionLegacy of the Force: Invincible participating on the side of Darth Caedus's faction of the Galactic Alliance.\nAt some point following the Second Galactic Civil War, heavy warships like the Star Defenders and Star Dreadnoughts were phased out of service, citing the expenses in operating the various designs.Legacy Era Campaign Guide\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\nBy 130 ABY, the main-line Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer had some of its systems partially based on achievements made with the successful Executor-class. The larger Imperious-class Star Destroyer was based on the Pellaeon and had a larger frame than the standard Star Destroyer classes of previous generations, but still shared their designation rather than be rated a battlecruiser or a dreadnought.\n\n\u2022 Designs\n\n\u2022 Allegiance-class battlecruiser\n\nAllegiance-class battlecruiser\nThe 2,200 meter Allegiance-class design was a typical example of the Star Cruiser subclass of battlecruisers. Allegiances were smaller Super Star Destroyers seen in use as escorts for larger vessels like the Eclipse-class. They had a design reminiscent of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, only larger. The class had a ventrally protruding reactor core and no visible launch bay.\n\n\u2022 The Aramadia\n\nAramadia (Super Star Destroyer)\nThe Aramadia was an Imperial SSD that was captured by the Yevethans and acted as one of Nil Spaars flagships during the Yevethan Purge in 16-17 ABY. Following the Battle of Nzoth and the end of the Purge, it was towed to Nzoth and used as a museum. In top-down profile, it resembled the Imperial-class Star Destroyer.Coruscant and the Core Worlds'\n\n\u2022 The Arc Hammer\n\nArc Hammer\nAt least 9.6&#32;km long, almost half as long as an Executor-class Star Dreadnought, the Arc Hammer was essentially an armed factory ship that also served as a command ship for the Dark Trooper Project. The design was very sleek compared to other Super Star Destroyers (similar only to Jerecs ship), and noteworthy for a large quadruple tower structure protruding from the dorsal and ventral side in the general area of the bridge structure. Dorsal bays could launch the ships complement of Dark troopers onto a target in a combat drop. The Arc Hammer was destroyed from within by Kyle Katarns sabotage.Star Wars: Dark Forces'\n\n\u2022 Assertor-class Star Dreadnought\n\nAssertor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends\nThe 15,000 meter Assertor-class Star Dreadnought was a heavily armed Imperial Star Dreadnought. Ships of this class sometimes led elite units that used TIE/D Defender starfighter squadrons. Two were seen at Naval Station Validusia.\n\n\u2022 Bellator-class dreadnought\n\nBellator-class dreadnought/Legends\nThe 7,200 meter Bellator-class dreadnought was based on the earlier Mandator and Mandator II dreadnought models and was a slightly scaled down version of them. Several vessels were seen at Naval Station Validusia. Two Bellators were viewed by the commanders of Death Squadron at a fleet gathering prior to the Battle of Hoth. At least one vessel later served in the forces of the resurrected Emperor Palpatine in 10 ABY. A Bellator was escorted by a Star Destroyer in orbit of Byss around this time.\n\n\u2022 Eclipse-class dreadnought\n\nEclipse-class dreadnought\nThe Eclipse-class was designed as flagships for Emperor Palpatine and were constructed in relative secrecy. They were 17.5 kilometers in length, with much of their interiors taken up by generators used to power the ships main weapon, a scaled-down superlaser. The classs design was meant to evoke ancient seagoing warships.\n\n\u2022 Executor-class Star Dreadnought\n\nExecutor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends\nThe Executor-class Star Dreadnought was the first class associated with the SSD moniker. It was 19 kilometers in length, was powered by a central reactor underneath its command tower, had over 5,000 various weapons-systems, and could carry over a thousand starfighters in its multiple hangar bays. Its design was meant to overwhelm any opposition, sending the enemy into retreat or resignation by its mere presence. The class became popular within the Imperial Navy, and officers desired such ships as a status symbol.Cracken's Threat Dossier Since the Super-class designation originated with this ship, it was often called Super-class Star Destroyer interchangeably with other terms.Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire novelThe Black Fleet Crisis\n\n\u2022 Mandator II-class Star Dreadnaught\n\nMandator II-class Star Dreadnaught/Legends\nThe 8,000-meter Mandator II-class Star Dreadnaught was built and fielded by KDY and the Galactic Republic. The model served in the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars and guarded vital targets from Separatist attacks.\n\n\u2022 Mandator III-class dreadnought\n\nMandator III-class dreadnought\nThe 12,000-meter Mandator III-class was built and fielded by the Galactic Empire. It was several kilometers longer than previous models and enlarged to carry massive armaments.\n\n\u2022 The Megador\n\nMegador\nThe Megador was a sixteen-engined SSD that served in the Imperial Remnant during the Orinda campaign and later on the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. It was armed with long-range turbolasers during the Second Galactic Civil War.\n\n\u2022 Sovereign-class Super Star Destroyer\n\nSovereign-class Super Star Destroyer\nThe Sovereign-class was a 15-kilometer, scaled-down version of the Eclipse-class, meant for mass production. Like the Eclipse, the Sovereign was armed with a superlaser as its primary weapon. None of the four initial ships survived the fall of the resurrected Palpatine, and all were destroyed before completion.\n\n\u2022 Super Star Destroyer prototype\n\nSuper Star Destroyer prototype\nThis ship, developed in the Sarlacc Project, was 12 kilometers long, had a central reactor, and was meant to be covered in armaments and serve as the Imperial Navys symbolic flagship. It was destroyed while partially unfinished during the Battle of Byss. Despite its destruction, it served as a precursor to later classes, like the Executor'.\n\n\u2022 Vengeance-class dreadnought\n\nVengeance-class dreadnought\nThis 19,000-meter dreadnought model was used by the Galactic Empire. Several vessels participated in the prelude to Operation Shadow Hand, where at least one was destroyed during the infighting of the Imperial Civil War.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nDarksaber]]\n\u2022 X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar\n\n\u2022 Murder in Slushtime \"Callista Ming\" capsule\n\n\u2022 Before the Storm\n\n\u2022 Shield of Lies\n\n\u2022 Tyrant's Test\n\n\u2022 Two for One\n\n\u2022 Young Jedi Knights: Shards of Alderaan\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force\n\n\u2022 Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Inferno\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Fury\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Revelation\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Invincible\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Backlash Fate of the Jedi: Backlash (audiobook) in Natasi Daala's office\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse (audiobook)\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStay on Target]]\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",

There are also vehicles players can jump into, both ground and airborne.<ref name=\"SW:BF\" />\n\nThe game features four main factions from both the [[Prequel trilogy|prequel]] and the [[Original trilogy|classic]] trilogies. They are the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] (Separatists) of the prequel era, and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] of the classic trilogy. However, factions can only play their historical adversary; Rebels cannot fight Separatists, for example. Within each unit, five different classes of characters become available.<ref name=\"SW:BF\" />\n\nFour of the classes are fairly similar for each faction: a basic infantry soldier, a heavy weapons trooper with a rocket launcher, a pilot, and a [[Sniper/Legends|sniper]]. The fifth class is different for each faction. The Imperials have the [[Dark Trooper/Legends|dark trooper]], with a jump pack which enables short but high jumps, plus a blast cannon, a pistol and grenades. The Republic has the [[Clone jet trooper/Legends|jet trooper]], with a jetpack, which enables long but low jumps, an enhanced pistol, grenades and an [[Electromagnetic pulse launcher|EMP launcher]]. The Separatists have the [[Droideka/Legends|droideka]], which is very powerful, fast, and equipped with a personal shield, but can't use vehicles. The Rebels have the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Smuggler/Legends|Smuggler]], with extra health, time bombs, a bowcaster, and a grenade launcher. Players choose their class at the spawn screen.<ref name=\"SW:BF\" />\n\n[[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] heroes are featured in the game: the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] gets [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] wields his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] for the Empire, [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] fights along with the Republic, and [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] is with the Separatists. Other Jedi characters appear but are not playable; they may only be the player's allies in battle, under certain circumstances. The heroes will occasionally fight alongside the player in the campaign battles, in which case the other team won't have a hero. Heroes can be enabled in Instant Action mode, allowing both teams to have a Jedi hero. Once his team's reinforcement count drops below a certain number, the hero automatically dies.<ref name=\"SW:BF\" />\n\nThere are also non-playable characters (NPCs): [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] roam the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] and attack both sides, [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]] patrol the streets of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]], [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] inhabit the jungle of the forest moon of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]] battle on the [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] Plain, [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal guards]] patrol Theed, [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] defend [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] and [[Geonosian/Legends|Geonosians]] aid the Separatists on [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]]. Additionally, there are droids which can provide [[Power droid/Legends|ammo]] or health [[Medical droid/Legends|refills]]. Players can also take over turrets.<ref name=\"SW:BF\" />\n\n===Game style===\nEvery match sees the players fighting the enemy faction. They win by forcing the enemy reinforcement count to zero or capturing all five Command Posts spread throughout the map.<ref name=\"SW:BF\" />\n\nThe multiplayer matches can be online or offline on any of the available maps. The single-player skirmish missions are known as Instant Action.<ref name=\"SW:BF\" />\n\nPlayers may play battles by themselves with NPCs or play an online multiplayer via Internet, LAN or direct connection. Multiplayer consists of up to 16 online players vs. players on consoles or up to 40 on PC. The servers on PC are dedicated or standard and can be protected with a password.\n\n===Maps===\n#Bespin: Platforms\n#Bespin: Cloud City\n#Endor: Bunker\n#Geonosis: Spire\n#Hoth: Echo Base\n#Kamino: Tipoca City\n#Kashyyyk: Docks\n#Kashyyyk: Islands\n#Naboo: Plains\n#Naboo: Theed\n#Rhen Var: Harbor\n#Rhen Var Citadel\n#Tatooine: Dune Sea\n#Tatooine: Mos Eisley\n#Yavin 4: Arena\n#Yavin 4: Temple\nIn addition the map Tatooine: Jabba's Palace came with the 1.2 update.\n\n[[File:Clone_sharpshooter.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] [[Sniper/Legends|sharpshooter]] on Geonosis]]\n===Playable vehicles and ships===\nThese vehicles have many capabilities from the movies; a Republic Gunship can carry/hold up to five people, and Rebel Snowspeeders can launch a [[Power harpoon launcher|tow cable]] out of the rear of the vehicle to trip AT-ATs. In addition, blaster turrets and emplaced guns are available on various maps including unique turrets in maps such as Yavin temple and Hoth.\n\n===Unit types===\n*Basic Infantryman: [[Clone trooper/Legends|Clone trooper]], [[B2-series super battle droid/Legends|Super Battle Droid]], [[B1-series battle droid/Legends|B1-Series battle droid]] (Campaign only), [[Rebel trooper/Legends|Rebel Soldier]], [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtrooper]]. They carry blasters and explosives.\n*Sniper: [[Clone sharpshooter/Legends|Clone Sharpshooter]], [[Assassin droid/Legends|Assassin Droid]], [[Rebel Marksman/Legends|Rebel Marksman]], [[Scout trooper/Legends|Scout trooper]]. They carry sniper rifles and Recon Droids.\n*Engineer: [[Clone trooper pilot/Legends|Clone Engineer]], [[OOM pilot battle droid/Legends|Droid Engineer]], [[Rebel pilot/Legends|Rebel Smuggler]], [[TIE pilot|Imperial Engineer]]. They carry special launchers and ammunition dispensers.\n*Heavy: [[Clone heavy assault trooper|ARC Trooper]], [[Assault battle droid|Assault Droid]], [[Rebel Vanguard/Legends|Rebel vanguard]], [[Shock trooper/Legends|Shock trooper]]. They carry rocket launchers and mines.\n*Special: [[Clone jet trooper/Legends|Jet Trooper]], [[Droideka/Legends|Droideka]], [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Smuggler/Legends|Smuggler]], [[Phase Zero dark trooper|Dark Trooper]]. They carry special weapons. The Jet Troopers and Dark Troopers feature jet packs, while the destroyer droids can transform into their wheeled form for increased mobility.\n\n[[File:Imps.png|thumb|300px|Left to right: A Stormtrooper, a Shocktrooper, a Dark Trooper (Phase Zero), a Scout trooper, a Snowtrooper, an AT-AT pilot, a TIE pilot, and an AT-ST pilot]]\n\n===Mod tools===\nIn late 2004, [[LucasArts]] and [[Pandemic Studios]] released the ''Star Wars: Battlefront'' BFBuilder, an unsupported [[Wikipedia:Mod (computer gaming)|modding tool]] that allows players to create new battlefields for ''Star Wars: Battlefront''.<ref name=\"Modding info\">{{LucasArtsCite|url=thread.jspa?threadID=20059&tstart=420|text=Thread: PC Mod Tools <nowiki>[TDE]</nowiki>|nobackup=1}}</ref> It shipped with many of the source files used to make ''Star Wars: Battlefront'', such as maps, sides, and sound configuration files; however, it did not ship with some of the files needed to make specific modifications to the main game itself (i.e. menu configuration files or font files). Two demonstration maps were also included. Sound effects and music used to make the game were not included because of copyright issues,<ref name=\"BFBuild Read\">BFBuilder ReadMe</ref> although it is possible to import original music and sound effects into the game.\n\nMap editing in BFBuilder is handled by a program called ZeroEdit, which is used to mold the landscapes, place objects, command posts and vehicle spawn points. Additional scripting is done through LUA files for maps, and ODF (Object Definition Files) files for objects.<ref name=\"ZeroEdit\">{{WebCite|url=http://swbfmodding.wikidot.com/zeroeditor|text=Zeroeditor|archivedate=20191227122943}}</ref>\n\nUser-created levels and mods then go through a process called munging, which compiles assets and maps into formats readable by the game, which are then compiled into container files for in-game use. Although BFBuilder is subtly different from the [[Star Wars: Battlefront II#Mod tools|''Battlefront II'' mod tools]], assets can be imported from either one into the other.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:StarWarsBattlefrontLogo.png|thumb|right|250px|Battlefront's logo]]\nOn [[January 13]], [[2004]], [[LucasArts]] announced ''Star Wars: Battlefront'' as a multiplayer action game.<ref name=\"Press release\">{{LucasArtsCite|url=company/release/news20040113.html|text=LucasArts Announces Details On Star Wars Battlefront\u2122}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment began in November [[2002]] at [[Pandemic Studios]], according to Executive Producer Greg Borrud. It was conceived as \"the ultimate fan's dream.\" Lead Artists Dean Betton and Matt Palmer directed the art team in creating a vast array of unusual worlds and characters that have appeared in the ''Star Wars'' universe.<ref name=\"DevDiaries\">{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/f20040913/index.html|text=Go Behind the Scenes with Battlefront Designer Diaries}}</ref>\n\nThe developers used software called SoftImage:XSI.<ref name=\"DevDiary2\">{{WebCite|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/star-wars-battlefront/502733p1.html|text=Star Wars Battlefront &ndash; Designer Diary #2|work=GameSpy|archivedate=20161220030436}}</ref> The character models were initially modeled as static objects using a 3D modeling package in a process known as \"boning and skinning.\" The process entails first creating a digital \"skeleton.\" Lead programmer John Northan notes that the single-player experience is controlled by Artificial Intelligence where the AI for each entity is calculated at several different layers, ranging from the controller AI to a strategic AI. He also explained that the various soldier divisions have unique personalities. Sound Supervisor Nick Peck wrote that the process for creating sounds was to identify what was needed, create the sounds, and then integrate it into the game via programming software. He and his team researched original ''Star Wars'' sound effects, then tweaked them and integrated them into the game. Since ''Battlefront'' is an action game, Peck and his team traveled to [[Skywalker Ranch]] and spent two days creating 1200 new foley (sound) effects, a very detailed process.<ref name=\"DevDiaries\" />\n\nThere is a playable Xbox demo on the [[Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)|''Star Wars'' Trilogy]] [[Star Wars home video releases|DVD]] set, released on [[September 21]], [[2004]]. The demo gameplay is limited to a [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] level, and is slightly different to that of the actual game.<ref name=\"Demo announcement\">{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/news/2004/04/news20040420.html|text=Star Wars Trilogy DVD Details}}</ref> A PS2 demo was also released with Sony's [[Wikipedia:PlayStation|PlayStation]] magazine. It also only featured the Battle of Endor.<ref name=\"PS 2 demo\">{{WebCite|url=http://www.ign.com/games/official-playstation-magazine-vol-85/ps2-700058|text=Official PlayStation Magazine Vol. 85|work=IGN|archivedate=20160927023019}}</ref> A glitch in this demo was that the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] Wookiee Smuggler class gave orders in [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], rather than growls.\n\n==Continuity==\n===Cut content===\nDuring development, certain content was either cut from the game entirely, or changed drastically before the final release.\n\n*[[Seraph-class urban landspeeder|Flash Speeder]] (Appears as in Clone Wars Campaign and Trailer)\n*[[All Terrain Personal Transport/Legends|AT-PT]] (Design differs from the Imperial version. The control pod is sleeker and features an open cockpit)\n*[[All Terrain Experimental Transport|AT-XT]]\n*[[Sentinel-class landing craft/Legends|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]]\n*[[Multi-Troop Transport/Legends|Multi-Troop Transport]]\n*[[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighter]]\n*[[BTL-S8 K-wing assault starfighter|K-wing]]\n*An earlier version of the Droid Assassin used the model of an [[IG-series/Legends|IG-Series]] droid. The model was released within the Mod Tools for ''Star Wars: Battlefront''.\n*A sixth unit was originally planned for the game but cut:\n**A [[Clone Commander/Legends|Clone Commander]] unit, using the ARC Trooper model with red markings. It would have been armed with a grenade launcher, a recon droid, and health/ammo packs. A later version of the Clone Commander unit carried a blaster pistol instead of a recon droid.\n**A Tactical Droid, armed with a Sonic Blaster, a Blaster Pistol, and a 'Droid Enhancer' which increased health, damage or speed dependant on which mode was selected. The Tactical Droid used the standard B-1 Battle Droid model.\n**A Rebel Spy, armed with a Seeker Rifle, Remote Detonators, and a Disguise Kit which could cycle through enemy appearances. The model used for the Rebel Spy was that of a [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]].\n**An Imperial Officer, armed with a Blaster Pistol and a powerup dispenser for health and ammo.\n*The Geonosis Map originally had a different layout.\n*Jedi heroes were originally going to be equipped with Force powers and powerful jumps.\n*Generic Jedi units were to support the Republic on Geonosis. Strangely, one of the Jedi's skins looks like Darth Maul.\n*A cinematic clip was going to play at the end of each battle.\nSome reasons behind this may be issues of balance and/or memory. Most likely, LucasArts did not want Episode III content revealed so early (one example is the Kashyyyk: Docks map ([[Kachirho/Legends|Kachirho]]), which, at the time, could not be identified).\n\nThe Clone Commander, Imperial Officer and Bothan Spy would later become playable in ''Star Wars: Battlefront II''.\n\nThe trailer for ''Star Wars: Battlefront'' showed that players could fly Droid Starfighters and Jedi Starfighters on Kamino. This was most likely cut because gameplay was too similar to Bespin: Platforms.\n\n===Inconsistencies with ''Star Wars'' continuity===\n[[Lucasfilm]]'s Keeper of the [[Holocron continuity database]], [[Leland Chee]], has stated that though technology, characters and locations in the game are C-canon, the story itself is S-canon, which means that only parts of it that appeared in other C-canon sources are [[canon]]. The story of the [[Star Wars: Battlefront II|sequel]], however, is C-canon.<ref name=\"Chee's blog\">{{Blog|holocron|56|starwars.com forum HolocronKeeper comments archive}}</ref>\n\nThere are many major canonical inconsistencies in the ''Star Wars: Battlefront'' series. However, many of these are simply game mechanics.\n*Assault droids (the CIS's heavy-weapons unit) are depicted with blue markings on their bodies while the pilot droids have no markings. This was corrected in ''Star Wars: Battlefront II''.\n*In the Clone Wars campaign, ARC troopers (the Republic's heavy-weapons unit) are playable on Geonosis, and Jet Troopers are the new units (instead of ARC troopers) in The Battle of Kamino.<ref name=\"SW:BF\" /> Previous sources indicated that ARC troopers did not participate in the Battle of Geonosis.<ref name=\"Republic comic\">''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' comic</ref> Also, in the ''Star Wars: Battlefront II'' version of the Battle of Geonosis, both Jet Troopers and ARC Troopers are playable.\n*The [[Battle of Rhen Var (Clone Wars)|first Rhen Var mission]] of the campaign takes place after the Battle of Kamino, and the mission briefing says that they are establishing a base, not defending or retaking one, and does not imply any previous battle happening.\n*In the game, Imperial [[Dark Trooper/Legends|dark troopers]] are not droids, but soldiers with power armor, and they give orders and cry out when they are hit as [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] do. Also, dark troopers are seen in a battle prior to their development. These inconsistencies were retconned by ''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]'', which retconned them to be the [[Phase Zero dark trooper]]s, part clone trooper, part cyborg.\n*In the second campaign mission, the Trade Federation wins instead of the Royal Guards.<ref name=\"TPM\">{{Film|I}}</ref>\n*In the Galactic Civil War campaign, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] is present during the siege of Mos Eisley,<ref name=\"SW:BF\" /> but in the movie he was on the Death Star while that was happening.<ref name=\"ANH\">{{Film|IV}}</ref> ''Star Wars'' novels state that Vader would never return to Tatooine for emotional reasons.<ref name=\"DL:R\">''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]''</ref>\n*During the Battle of Hoth in campaign mode, the Rebels win<ref name=\"SW:BF\" /> instead of the Empire.<ref name=\"ESB\">{{Film|V}}</ref>\n*Wookiees and Imperial Darktroopers fight on Endor<ref name=\"SW:BF\" /> even though the Darktrooper project was destroyed three years before.<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\n===Trooper variations===\nThe following are troops that change their stormtrooper or Rebel skin on certain maps:\n\nGalactic Empire:\n*Scout trooper-Hoth, Rhen Var - Snowtrooper\n*Stormtrooper-Hoth, Rhen Var - Snowtrooper\n*Shock trooper-Hoth, Rhen Var - Snowtrooper\n*Imperial Pilot-Hoth, Rhen Var - AT-AT Pilot\n*Imperial Pilot-Naboo, Endor, Tatooine, Yavin - AT-ST Pilot\n*Imperial Pilot-Tatooine, Bespin, Kashyyyk - TIE Fighter Pilot\n\nRebel Alliance:\n*Rebel Soldier - Hoth, Rhen Var - Hoth uniform\n*Rebel Soldier - Endor, Yavin IV, Naboo - Forest Uniform\n*Rebel Soldier - Bespin - Gray Uniform\n*Rebel Vanguard - Hoth, Rhen Var - Hoth uniform\n*Rebel Marksmen - Hoth, Rhen Var - Hoth uniform\n*Rebel Pilot - Hoth, Rhen Var - Hoth uniform\n*Wookiee - Hoth, Rhen Var - Snow covered fur\n\n==Credits==\n{{Incomplete_credits}}\n{{Credits\n|cast=\n*[[Chris Cox]]: [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance]] [[Soldier/Legends|Infantry]]/[[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|CIS Infantry]]/CIS [[Officer/Legends|Officer]]/[[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] Infantry\n*[[David W.

It was developed by Pandemic Studios and LucasArts, and released on September 21, 2004 for Xbox (playable on Xbox 360), PlayStation 2, and PC, the same day as the release of the Star Wars Trilogy DVD set. Players can play Star Wars: Battlefront either online, or offline with up to four players (on consoles).\nA sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront II, was released on November 1, 2005, and a compilation including both games, Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection, was released on March 14, 2024. The game series also featured several spin-offs, and a reboot, Star Wars Battlefront, released on November 17, 2015.\n\n\u2022 Synopsis\n\nThe Historical Campaign in Star Wars: Battlefront is divided into two parts, the Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War, following the timeline of the Star Wars films.\n\n\u2022 Clone Wars Campaign\n\n(32 BBY \u2013 19 BBY)\n\u2022 Battle of Naboo (32 BBY)\n\nThe Trade Federation has blockaded the peaceful planet of Naboo. The Trade Federation army of B1-Series battle droids marches to the Great Grass Plains to destroy the native Gungan Grand Army, which opposes them on the surface. The Trade Federation army arrives in Multi-Troop Transports with Armored Assault Tanks (AATs). The Gungan Grand Army awaits them with legions of Gungan soldiers, some riding kaadu. Their fambaas arrive with giant portable deflector shield generators, which are activated to protect the Gungan army. The attacking Trade Federation force overwhelms the shielding and destroys the generators, allowing the AATs to tear through the Gungan force.\n\u2022 Rebellion on Theed (32 BBY)\n\nThe people and security forces of the Naboo capital city of Theed attack the Trade Federation's army of battle droids, supported by P-series droideka, in an attempt to assist Queen Amidala in recapturing the planet. Despite their efforts, the Trade Federation kills all the Royal Guards trying to defend the city.\n\u2022 Aggressive Negotiations (Separatist Crisis)\n\nThe Wookiee Trade Guild resists the taxes imposed by the Trade Federation, which is now part of the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS). In retaliation the CIS sends Darth Sidious's new apprentice Count Dooku and an army of battle droids, P-series droideka, and the new B2 super battle droids to end the conflict. The CIS force makes a direct strike at the headquarters of the Trade Guild on Kashyyyk. The CIS successfully destroys the Wookiee Trade Guild and its private army.\n\u2022 The Battle of Geonosis (22 BBY)\n\non Geonosis]]\nThe Galactic Republic has just acquired a new clone army from the Kaminoans on Kamino. The clone army arrives at the Separatist base on Geonosis with Jedi Master Mace Windu to destroy a Separatist army made up of battle droids, super battle droids, W-series droideka, and Geonosians. The clone army uses their AT-TEs to destroy the Techno Union ships, which the CIS was using to evacuate, and the clone troopers kill most of the Geonosian combatants and destroy the droid army.\n\u2022 Assault on Kamino (22 BBY)\n\nThe CIS has discovered the cloning facilities on Kamino and has sent an army of battle droids, super battle droids, and W-series droideka to destroy them. The Republic clone army left to defend it destroys all of the attacking droids.\n\u2022 Mountaintop Defenses (22 BBY)\n\nThe Republic has discovered a long-range sensor station on Rhen Var created by Count Dooku. They send an army of clone troopers with AT-TEs and a few TX-130 Saber-class fighter tanks to Rhen Var to capture the station. The army of clones destroys all of the battle droids, super battle droids, W-series droideka, and AATs defending the facility in conjunction with another operation led by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\u2022 The Battle of Kashyyyk (19 BBY)\n\nThe CIS has launches a desperate attack on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. A clone army of the Republic is sent to Kashyyyk to help defend against the army of battle droids, super battle droids, droideka, OG-9 homing spider droids, and AATs. They successfully destroy the entire Separatist army in the battle and save the Wookiees.\n\n\u2022 Galactic Civil War Campaign\n\n(0 BBY \u2013 4 ABY)\n\u2022 Desert Extermination (0 BBY)\n\nThe Galactic Empire sends a legion of stormtroopers with vehicular support to the Dune Sea on Tatooine to eliminate Rebels and hostile natives. The stormtrooper legion slaughters all the Rebels and Tusken Raiders they find in the Dune Sea.\n\u2022 Siege of Mos Eisley (0 BBY)\n\nThe stormtroopers of the Empire and Darth Vader have begun searching the town of Mos Eisley on Tatooine for the droids which carried the plans to the Death Star. The droids have escaped, so the stormtroopers and Darth Vader eliminate all locals that are suspected of having helped the droids flee.\n\u2022 Sabotage at Rhen Var (0 BBY)\n\nThe Rebellion has discovered an Imperial listening outpost on the planet Rhen Var and sends a company of troopers to capture the station. The Rebels fortify the captured outpost while the Empire prepares a counterattack. A force of stormtroopers assault the station and successfully defeat the Rebels, although the outpost is destroyed.\n\u2022 Raid on Yavin 4 (0 BBY)\n\nThe Empire sends down a legion of stormtroopers to verify the presence of a Rebel base on Yavin 4. They eliminate all of the Rebels in the Massassi Arena, thereby verifying the location of a Rebel base.\n\u2022 Fall of Yavin 4 (0 ABY)\n\nThe Death Star has been destroyed and several escape pods have crashed down on Yavin 4. The surviving stormtroopers attack the Rebel base but are all killed by the Rebels defending the base.\n\u2022 The Battle of Hoth (3 ABY)\n\nThe Rebel Base on Hoth has been discovered by the Empire, and stormtroopers and All Terrain Armored Transports (AT-ATs) are sent down to destroy the Rebel base, protected by a shield generator, before the Rebels can evacuate. The Rebels, with the help of Luke Skywalker, destroy the AT-ATs and prevent the stormtroopers from attacking long enough so that the transports could escape.\n\u2022 Liberation of Cloud City (Sometime 3-4 ABY)\n\nThe Rebellion sends a company of Rebels to attack the Imperial garrison on Bespin. The Rebels then eliminate the Imperial forces in Cloud City.\n\u2022 Battle in the Clouds (Sometime 3-4 ABY)\n\nFollowing the liberation of Cloud City, the Rebellion moves to eliminate all of the stormtroopers on the main mining platform on Bespin.\n\u2022 The Battle of Endor (4 ABY)\n\nThe second Death Star is being constructed above the forest moon of Endor. The Rebellion sends a legion of Rebels which allied with the native Ewoks to destroy the shield bunker which projects a shield around the second Death Star. The Rebels succeed in the mission, allowing for the destruction of the battlestation.\n\n\u2022 Galactic Conquest\n\nGalactic Conquest allows the player to choose a faction and use it to conquer the galaxy. As a result, it is considered non-canon.\n\u2022 Rebels - Birth of the Rebellion\n\n\u2022 Empire - Dark Side Rising\n\n\u2022 Republic - Attack of the Clones\n\n\u2022 CIS - Revenge of the Sith\n\n\u2022 Rebels/Empire - The Galactic Civil War\n\n\u2022 Rebels/Empire - A Galaxy Divided\n\n\u2022 Republic/CIS - The Clone Wars\n\n\u2022 Republic/CIS - Balance of the Force\n\n\u2022 Sequels\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront II was released on November 1, 2005 on the PS2, Xbox, PSP, and PC platforms. The first game and the sequel were re-released on March 14, 2024, as the Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection.\nOn the 10th of May 2007, LucasArts announced a PSP exclusive addition to the Star Wars: Battlefront series, Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron, which was released October 9, 2007. A further game exclusive to mobile platforms, Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron was released in 2009.\nA new version of Star Wars: Battlefront, by DICE Studios, was announced at E3 2013, and was released on the 17th of November, 2015. The revived version also received a sequel in 2017.\n\n\u2022 Gameplay\n\n\u2022 Character overview\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront lets players control a soldier in a first- or third-person perspective. There are also vehicles players can jump into, both ground and airborne.\nThe game features four main factions from both the prequel and the classic trilogies. They are the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (Separatists) of the prequel era, and the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire of the classic trilogy. However, factions can only play their historical adversary; Rebels cannot fight Separatists, for example. Within each unit, five different classes of characters become available.\nFour of the classes are fairly similar for each faction: a basic infantry soldier, a heavy weapons trooper with a rocket launcher, a pilot, and a sniper. The fifth class is different for each faction. The Imperials have the dark trooper, with a jump pack which enables short but high jumps, plus a blast cannon, a pistol and grenades. The Republic has the jet trooper, with a jetpack, which enables long but low jumps, an enhanced pistol, grenades and an EMP launcher. The Separatists have the droideka, which is very powerful, fast, and equipped with a personal shield, but can't use vehicles. The Rebels have the Wookiee Smuggler, with extra health, time bombs, a bowcaster, and a grenade launcher. Players choose their class at the spawn screen.\nJedi heroes are featured in the game: the Rebel Alliance gets Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader wields his lightsaber for the Empire, Mace Windu fights along with the Republic, and Count Dooku is with the Separatists. Other Jedi characters appear but are not playable; they may only be the players allies in battle, under certain circumstances. The heroes will occasionally fight alongside the player in the campaign battles, in which case the other team wont have a hero. Heroes can be enabled in Instant Action mode, allowing both teams to have a Jedi hero. Once his team's reinforcement count drops below a certain number, the hero automatically dies.\nThere are also non-playable characters (NPCs): Tusken Raiders roam the Dune Sea of Tatooine and attack both sides, Jawas patrol the streets of Mos Eisley, Ewoks inhabit the jungle of the forest moon of Endor, Gungans battle on the Naboo Plain, Royal guards patrol Theed, Wookiees defend Kashyyyk and Geonosians aid the Separatists on Geonosis. Additionally, there are droids which can provide ammo or health refills. Players can also take over turrets.\n\n\u2022 Game style\n\nEvery match sees the players fighting the enemy faction. They win by forcing the enemy reinforcement count to zero or capturing all five Command Posts spread throughout the map.\nThe multiplayer matches can be online or offline on any of the available maps. The single-player skirmish missions are known as Instant Action.\nPlayers may play battles by themselves with NPCs or play an online multiplayer via Internet, LAN or direct connection. Multiplayer consists of up to 16 online players vs. players on consoles or up to 40 on PC. The servers on PC are dedicated or standard and can be protected with a password.\n\n\u2022 Maps\n\n\u2022 Bespin: Platforms\n\n\u2022 Bespin: Cloud City\n\n\u2022 Endor: Bunker\n\n\u2022 Geonosis: Spire\n\n\u2022 Hoth: Echo Base\n\n\u2022 Kamino: Tipoca City\n\n\u2022 Kashyyyk: Docks\n\n\u2022 Kashyyyk: Islands\n\n\u2022 Naboo: Plains\n\n\u2022 Naboo: Theed\n\n\u2022 Rhen Var: Harbor\n\n\u2022 Rhen Var Citadel\n\n\u2022 Tatooine: Dune Sea\n\n\u2022 Tatooine: Mos Eisley\n\n\u2022 Yavin 4: Arena\n\n\u2022 Yavin 4: Temple\n\nIn addition the map Tatooine: Jabba's Palace came with the 1.2 update.\nsharpshooter on Geonosis]]\n\n\u2022 Playable vehicles and ships\n\nThese vehicles have many capabilities from the movies; a Republic Gunship can carry/hold up to five people, and Rebel Snowspeeders can launch a tow cable out of the rear of the vehicle to trip AT-ATs. In addition, blaster turrets and emplaced guns are available on various maps including unique turrets in maps such as Yavin temple and Hoth.\n\n\u2022 Unit types\n\n\u2022 Basic Infantryman: Clone trooper, Super Battle Droid, B1-Series battle droid (Campaign only), Rebel Soldier, Stormtrooper. They carry blasters and explosives.\n\n\u2022 Sniper: Clone Sharpshooter, Assassin Droid, Rebel Marksman, Scout trooper. They carry sniper rifles and Recon Droids.\n\n\u2022 Engineer: Clone Engineer, Droid Engineer, Rebel Smuggler, Imperial Engineer. They carry special launchers and ammunition dispensers.\n\n\u2022 Heavy: ARC Trooper, Assault Droid, Rebel vanguard, Shock trooper. They carry rocket launchers and mines.\n\n\u2022 Special: Jet Trooper, Droideka, Wookiee Smuggler, Dark Trooper. They carry special weapons. The Jet Troopers and Dark Troopers feature jet packs, while the destroyer droids can transform into their wheeled form for increased mobility.\n\n\u2022 Mod tools\n\nIn late 2004, LucasArts and Pandemic Studios released the Star Wars: Battlefront BFBuilder, an unsupported modding tool that allows players to create new battlefields for Star Wars: Battlefront. It shipped with many of the source files used to make Star Wars: Battlefront, such as maps, sides, and sound configuration files; however, it did not ship with some of the files needed to make specific modifications to the main game itself (i.e. menu configuration files or font files). Two demonstration maps were also included. Sound effects and music used to make the game were not included because of copyright issues,BFBuilder ReadMe although it is possible to import original music and sound effects into the game.\nMap editing in BFBuilder is handled by a program called ZeroEdit, which is used to mold the landscapes, place objects, command posts and vehicle spawn points. Additional scripting is done through LUA files for maps, and ODF (Object Definition Files) files for objects.\nUser-created levels and mods then go through a process called munging, which compiles assets and maps into formats readable by the game, which are then compiled into container files for in-game use. Although BFBuilder is subtly different from the Battlefront II mod tools, assets can be imported from either one into the other.\n\n\u2022 Development\n\nOn January 13, 2004, LucasArts announced Star Wars: Battlefront as a multiplayer action game.\nDevelopment began in November 2002 at Pandemic Studios, according to Executive Producer Greg Borrud. It was conceived as \"the ultimate fans dream.\" Lead Artists Dean Betton and Matt Palmer directed the art team in creating a vast array of unusual worlds and characters that have appeared in the Star Wars' universe.\nThe developers used software called SoftImage:XSI. The character models were initially modeled as static objects using a 3D modeling package in a process known as \"boning and skinning.\" The process entails first creating a digital \"skeleton.\" Lead programmer John Northan notes that the single-player experience is controlled by Artificial Intelligence where the AI for each entity is calculated at several different layers, ranging from the controller AI to a strategic AI. He also explained that the various soldier divisions have unique personalities. Sound Supervisor Nick Peck wrote that the process for creating sounds was to identify what was needed, create the sounds, and then integrate it into the game via programming software. He and his team researched original Star Wars sound effects, then tweaked them and integrated them into the game. Since Battlefront is an action game, Peck and his team traveled to Skywalker Ranch and spent two days creating 1200 new foley (sound) effects, a very detailed process.\nThere is a playable Xbox demo on the Star Wars Trilogy DVD set, released on September 21, 2004. The demo gameplay is limited to a Battle of Endor level, and is slightly different to that of the actual game. A PS2 demo was also released with Sony's PlayStation magazine. It also only featured the Battle of Endor. A glitch in this demo was that the Rebel Wookiee Smuggler class gave orders in Basic, rather than growls.\n\n\u2022 Continuity\n\n\u2022 Cut content\n\nDuring development, certain content was either cut from the game entirely, or changed drastically before the final release.\n\u2022 Flash Speeder (Appears as in Clone Wars Campaign and Trailer)\n\n\u2022 AT-PT (Design differs from the Imperial version. The control pod is sleeker and features an open cockpit)\n\n\u2022 AT-XT\n\n\u2022 Sentinel-class landing craft\n\n\u2022 Multi-Troop Transport\n\n\u2022 N-1 starfighter\n\n\u2022 K-wing\n\n\u2022 An earlier version of the Droid Assassin used the model of an IG-Series droid. The model was released within the Mod Tools for Star Wars: Battlefront.\n\n\u2022 A sixth unit was originally planned for the game but cut:\n\n\u2022 A Clone Commander unit, using the ARC Trooper model with red markings. It would have been armed with a grenade launcher, a recon droid, and health/ammo packs. A later version of the Clone Commander unit carried a blaster pistol instead of a recon droid.\n\n\u2022 A Tactical Droid, armed with a Sonic Blaster, a Blaster Pistol, and a Droid Enhancer which increased health, damage or speed dependant on which mode was selected. The Tactical Droid used the standard B-1 Battle Droid model.\n\n\u2022 A Rebel Spy, armed with a Seeker Rifle, Remote Detonators, and a Disguise Kit which could cycle through enemy appearances. The model used for the Rebel Spy was that of a Bothan.\n\n\u2022 An Imperial Officer, armed with a Blaster Pistol and a powerup dispenser for health and ammo.\n\n\u2022 The Geonosis Map originally had a different layout.\n\n\u2022 Jedi heroes were originally going to be equipped with Force powers and powerful jumps.\n\n\u2022 Generic Jedi units were to support the Republic on Geonosis. Strangely, one of the Jedi's skins looks like Darth Maul.\n\n\u2022 A cinematic clip was going to play at the end of each battle.\n\nSome reasons behind this may be issues of balance and/or memory. Most likely, LucasArts did not want Episode III content revealed so early (one example is the Kashyyyk: Docks map (Kachirho), which, at the time, could not be identified).\nThe Clone Commander, Imperial Officer and Bothan Spy would later become playable in Star Wars: Battlefront II.\nThe trailer for Star Wars: Battlefront showed that players could fly Droid Starfighters and Jedi Starfighters on Kamino. This was most likely cut because gameplay was too similar to Bespin: Platforms.\n\n\u2022 Inconsistencies with Star Wars continuity\n\nLucasfilms Keeper of the Holocron continuity database, Leland Chee, has stated that though technology, characters and locations in the game are C-canon, the story itself is S-canon, which means that only parts of it that appeared in other C-canon sources are canon. The story of the sequel, however, is C-canon.starwars.com forum HolocronKeeper comments archive\nThere are many major canonical inconsistencies in the Star Wars: Battlefront series. However, many of these are simply game mechanics.\n\u2022 Assault droids (the CISs heavy-weapons unit) are depicted with blue markings on their bodies while the pilot droids have no markings. This was corrected in Star Wars: Battlefront II'.\n\n\u2022 In the Clone Wars campaign, ARC troopers (the Republics heavy-weapons unit) are playable on Geonosis, and Jet Troopers are the new units (instead of ARC troopers) in The Battle of Kamino. Previous sources indicated that ARC troopers did not participate in the Battle of Geonosis.Star Wars: Republic comic Also, in the Star Wars: Battlefront II' version of the Battle of Geonosis, both Jet Troopers and ARC Troopers are playable.\n\n\u2022 The first Rhen Var mission of the campaign takes place after the Battle of Kamino, and the mission briefing says that they are establishing a base, not defending or retaking one, and does not imply any previous battle happening.\n\n\u2022 In the game, Imperial dark troopers are not droids, but soldiers with power armor, and they give orders and cry out when they are hit as stormtroopers do. Also, dark troopers are seen in a battle prior to their development. These inconsistencies were retconned by The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide, which retconned them to be the Phase Zero dark troopers, part clone trooper, part cyborg.\n\n\u2022 In the second campaign mission, the Trade Federation wins instead of the Royal Guards.I\n\n\u2022 In the Galactic Civil War campaign, Darth Vader is present during the siege of Mos Eisley, but in the movie he was on the Death Star while that was happening.IV Star Wars novels state that Vader would never return to Tatooine for emotional reasons.Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader\n\n\u2022 During the Battle of Hoth in campaign mode, the Rebels win instead of the Empire.V\n\n\u2022 Wookiees and Imperial Darktroopers fight on Endor even though the Darktrooper project was destroyed three years before.The New Essential Chronology\n\n\u2022 Trooper variations\n\nThe following are troops that change their stormtrooper or Rebel skin on certain maps:\nGalactic Empire:\n\u2022 Scout trooper-Hoth, Rhen Var - Snowtrooper\n\n\u2022 Stormtrooper-Hoth, Rhen Var - Snowtrooper\n\n\u2022 Shock trooper-Hoth, Rhen Var - Snowtrooper\n\n\u2022 Imperial Pilot-Hoth, Rhen Var - AT-AT Pilot\n\n\u2022 Imperial Pilot-Naboo, Endor, Tatooine, Yavin - AT-ST Pilot\n\n\u2022 Imperial Pilot-Tatooine, Bespin, Kashyyyk - TIE Fighter Pilot\n\nRebel Alliance:\n\u2022 Rebel Soldier - Hoth, Rhen Var - Hoth uniform\n\n\u2022 Rebel Soldier - Endor, Yavin IV, Naboo - Forest Uniform\n\n\u2022 Rebel Soldier - Bespin - Gray Uniform\n\n\u2022 Rebel Vanguard - Hoth, Rhen Var - Hoth uniform\n\n\u2022 Rebel Marksmen - Hoth, Rhen Var - Hoth uniform\n\n\u2022 Rebel Pilot - Hoth, Rhen Var - Hoth uniform\n\n\u2022 Wookiee - Hoth, Rhen Var - Snow covered fur\n\n\u2022 Credits\n\nYoda]]\n\u2022 David Robb: Imperial Officer\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nBantha poodoo]]\"\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Year By Year: A Visual History, New Edition\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 \"Star Wars: Battlefront\"\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Battlefront on the Star Wars Gaming Wiki\n\n\u2022",

With their new powers, the Knights experimented upon other lifeforms to create monsters as extensions of their will. Other Jedi looked upon these new powers with horror. The earliest rebels, the Legions of Lettow, had been defeated in the First Great Schism, but their legacy remained, and a second group of dissidents would emerge, led by Ajunta Pall.\nAll great conflicts began with passion, and this one was no different. Firmly adamant in protecting their newly-acquired powers, this sect of Jedi sought to convince the other Jedi to embrace the Dark Side instead of fearing it. The others were not convinced. Firmly convinced that their way was right, the arguments turned into conflict. The rogue Jedi were exiled along with their teachings. A war had begun that would last a hundred years.\n\n\u2022 War\n\nDarth Plagueis]]\n]]\nDuring the war, the Jedi constructed the Prism, a secret prison facility known only to the members of the Jedi High Council.Darth Vader and the Ghost Prison 3\nAs the war went on, Sorzus Syn created Shamblers, Howlers, Pit Horrors, and ultimately, Leviathans, creatures that could suck life essences into blister-traps on their backs.\nThe last stand of the Dark Jedi was on the world of Corbos. With the help of infighting, the Dark Jedi were defeated.\n\n\u2022 Exile\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords\nare exiled.]]\nAfter their defeat on Corbos, the surviving Dark Jedi were rounded up by the Jedi. The Exiles, as they became known to the Jedi, were stripped of their weapons and navigational instruments, herded onto unarmed galleons, and banished beyond known space.\nThe Hundred-Year Darkness was over, and the Jedi had weathered the Second Great Schism.\n\n\u2022 A new world\n\nLegacy (2006) 30]]\nwitness the arrival of the exiles.]]\nInspired by rumors of the Kingdom of Sith, Sorzus Syn guided the Dark Jedi to Korriban. Landing on the world, they found that true to the rumors, it was inhabited by a humanoid species calling themselves the Sith. Hakagram Graush, the King of the Sith, was shocked at the appearance of the outsiders, but after witnessing their powers and advanced technology, the king welcomed the exiled Jedi to the world. However, this led to Graushs downfall. Graushs Shadow Hand conspired with the new arrivals, and betrayed his liege to the Dark Jedi. Using his training in the Force, Ajunta Pall beheaded Graush, convincing the Sith that the Exiles were gods. The Exiles became the rulers of the Sith and came to be called the Lords of the Sith. Ajunta Pall became the first Dark Lord of the Sith.\nand Karness Muur are greeted by the Sith.]]\nSorzus Syn learned the prophecy of the Sith'ari from the Sith. The Sith'ari was a perfect being who would one day lead the Sith. According to prophecy, the Sith'ari would rise up and destroy the Sith, but in the process make them stronger than ever before. Syn saw this as a striking parallel to the Chosen One of Jedi legend and speculated that she was the Sith'ari.\n\n\u2022 Return\n\nAfter becoming Sith Lords, several Exiles took the ship they had arrived on along with new weapons, Massassi warriors, and their new secrets of Sith alchemy in an attempt to destroy the Jedi against Ajunta Pall's orders, only to have themselves destroyed, and giving the Jedi the knowledge that Sith Space existed, and that the Exiles had survived.\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\nAs time passed, and interbreeding occurred between the Exiles and the Sith, the term \"Sith\" came to mean not only species, but also their fallen Jedi masters. When they first met the Exiles, the Sith wore primitive clothing. With the influence of the Exiles, elaborate clothing came into use.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe first reference to fallen Jedi becoming the rulers of the \"Sith civilization\" to be published was in Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1 This information was again mentioned in Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 1.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 1 The first mention of the name \"the Hundred-Year Darkness\" was in Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 3 in a list of events involving the Dark Side. No further information about it was mentioned.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 3\nIn Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 0, its mentioned that the \"First Great Schism\" was followed by \"a century of bloodshed\" that ended with the Dark Jedi faction getting exiled and becoming the first Sith Lords. In Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 2, the Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos says that the ancestors of the Sith Lords were exiled as a result of the \"Great Schism,\" implying that thanks to his ancestors being exiled at the end of the \"First Great Schism\", hes unaware that there was a \"Second Great Schism.\"\nArden Lyns biography in \"The Emperors Pawns\", a collection of biographies that were published in Star Wars Gamer #5 (2001), says that the \"First Great Schism\" occured ~25,000 BBY. The timeline in the beginning of The New Essential Guide to Characters (2002) mentions that \"circa 7,000 BBY\", \"The Jedi Knights lead the Republic through the Hundred-Year Darkness\", with no further information being given. The New Essential Guide to Characters also restates the information about the \"First Great Schism\" from Tales of the Jedi: Golden Age of the Sith and the year from \"The Emperors Pawns\" in the timeline in the beginning of the book and in the character entry for Naga Sadow.The New Essential Guide to Characters\nThe New Essential Chronology (2005) restates that the Hundred-Year Darkness occured ~7000 BBY, but also revealed it to be the same event as the \"hundred years of bloodshed\" mentioned in Tales of the Jedi: Golden Age of the Sith and to have followed the \"Second Great Schism\" while the \"First Great Schism\" was retconned to be a separate event. When asked about this retcon, Daniel Wallace, author of The New Esssential Chronology, said it was because of \"LFL internal documents\" dating Dark Jedi contact with the Sith species at ~7000 BBY. Leland Chee said that this retcon was to \"correct the the (sic) original discrepency of the timing of the Great Schism introduced by The New Essential Guide to Characters\", but didnt say what source The New Essential Guide to Characters created a discrepency with.Tasty Taste]]\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 0 First Great Schism\n\n\u2022 Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 2 Great Schism\n\n\u2022 Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 4\n\n\u2022 Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1\n\n\u2022 Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith audio drama\n\n\u2022 Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 1\n\n\u2022 Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 3 Hundred-Year Darkness\n\n\u2022 Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 4\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Old Republic Mentioned in Codex entry as \"The Second Great Schism\"\n\n\u2022 Darth Plagueis Darth Plagueis (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 The Wrath of Darth Maul\n\n\u2022 Darth Vader and the Ghost Prison 3 Second Great Schism\n\n\u2022 Empires End 2\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Ascension Fate of the Jedi: Ascension (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Legacy (2006) 30\n\n\u2022 Legacy (2006) 32\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars: Force and Destiny Core Rulebook]]\nGreat Hyperspace War]]\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",

    "content": "{{Top|real|title=List of changes in ''Star Wars'' re-releases}}\n{{Citation}}\n{{Cleanup}}\nThe following are partial '''lists of changes in ''Star Wars'' re-releases'''. The commercial success of ''[[Star Wars]]'' has given [[George Lucas]] the opportunity to tinker with his [[original trilogy]], now called [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], and [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. In a [[#External links|September 2004 MSNBC article]], Lucas points out that the original films were \"25 or 30 percent\" of what he intended.\n\nMany changes were motivated by the vast improvements in CGI technology and other production techniques that occurred in the two decades after the original trilogy was produced. Other changes improved the cohesiveness among the films, and eliminated [[Canon|continuity]] errors between the [[original trilogy]] and the [[prequel trilogy]].\n\nChanges to ''Star Wars'' films after the theatrical release aren't always limited to the original trilogy. In the release of [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']] DVD, two deleted portions were either partially or completely restored.\n\nThe [[Original unaltered trilogy|original, unaltered theatrical editions]] were released (as bonus material) on DVD on September 12, 2006. In 2011, the latest modifications to Episodes I-VI were released on [[Star Wars: The Complete Saga|Blu-ray]].\n\n==Changes to the Original Trilogy==\n===Theatrical releases===\nAlthough not as obvious as the 1997 [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]] re-release of the trilogy, there were still some alterations made in 1977, 1980, and 1981.\n\n====''A New Hope''====\n'''1977 Visual Differences'''\nThe earliest visual edits to the original film occurred between the initial release in May and the wider release later in 1977. The edits are minor, but noticeable. They consist of four changes. All of these changes were made before the foreign language prints were made later in 1977 and well before the last good interpositive was struck in 1985. These four shots run exactly the same length. All of them exist in the earliest bootleg video tapes and in the English 16mm prints. The original three effects shots exist in many home video English language versions released during the '80s. None of these shots are found in the Definitive Edition, Faces Edition, or 2006 bonus discs, nor are they in any of the known extant 35mm prints, or Technicolor prints.\n\n*When the ''Millennium Falcon'' is being pursued after taking off from Mos Eisley, the effects shot where the Star Destroyer is shooting at the ''Falcon'' was changed. The early version has different explosions and different flashes and looks less finished.\n*When the heroes arrive on [[Yavin 4]], the outdoor composited shot with the matte painting of the temple is recomposited and is not synced the same. It also has an artifact in the image.\n*When the fighters take off from Yavin 4, there is an extra cloud and the shot is not synced the same. It also has an artifact in the image.\n*The scrolling end credits are completely redone with the spacing, both vertical and horizontal, altered, and a glitch in composition at the beginning has been removed.\n\n'''1977 Mono Audio Differences'''\nThe film was originally released with 35mm Dolby Stereo and 70mm 6-track audio. Since these were both mastered from the same mix stems,<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://filmsound.org/AudiopostFAQ/audiopostfaq.htm#during%20mix|text=Audio Post FAQ's|archivedate=20230318102443}}</ref> there is little to no difference between them in terms of content. Both feature 4 main audio channels with the 6-track having at least one LFE, channel. A mono mix was produced in June 1977 for exhibition in cinemas with no Dolby Stereo or Surround support, which did contain the following changes in content from the other versions. The majority of foreign language versions use a stereo mix with many, but not all of the mono effects alterations.\n\n*A different explosion sound is heard when the ''Tantive IV''{{'s}} reactor is destroyed.\n*A different alarm sound is used as the rebel soldiers aboard the ''Tantive IV'' prepare for battle.\n*When R2-D2 falls over after being shot by the Jawas, the thud when he hits the ground is different.\n*[[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Aunt Beru's]] lines are alternate takes (possibly even a different actress).\n*When Luke and Obi-Wan discover the wrecked sandcrawler, R2-D2 beeps.\n*The stormtrooper who interrogates Luke and the others as they enter Mos Eisley's lines are timed earlier.\n*As Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan, and the droids approach [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|the Cantina]] in the mono sound version, a Cantina musical cue can be heard.\n*During the search of Mos Eisley for the droids, the stormtrooper's lines have been changed from \"Alright, check this side of the street. The door's locked. Move on to the next one.\" to \"Alright, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next one.\"\n*More growls are added to Chewbacca that were not present in the stereo and surround mixes.\n*A short beep can be heard when the Death Star's superlaser system is booted up to fire at Alderaan.\n*A different, lower frequency sound effect is used for Alderaan's explosion.\n*When R2-D2 shows the schematics of the Death Star's tractor beam, C-3PO now speaks over the scene, the line being \"The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.\". The sound effects for the schematics being displayed have also been changed. This change was later reinstated for the 1985 video release.\n*The line, \"We have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23\" was changed to \"Governer Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23\", possibly read by a different voice actor.\n*Luke groans when he gets dragged by the Dianoga into the trash compactor's murky waters for a second time.\n*The pipe creaks when it is being bent by the trash compactor walls.\n*[[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO's]] line \"Use the comlink? Oh my! I forgot, I turned it off.\" is from an alternate take.\n*As the stormtroopers chase Han and Chewbacca, one now says \"Close the blast doors!\" before the Rebels narrowly run through.\n*The line \"What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?\" spoken by Luke is from an alternate take.\n*The heavy echo from Luke and Leia's speech at the chasm is absent.\n*The blaster sound is different when Leia fires it at the stormtroopers.\n*Computer sounds are heard when Luke fires up the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} targeting system.\n*Luke's line, \"So, you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?\" is a different take.\n*The speech over the X-Wing's radios have less garble and static, and some lines are from alternate takes.\n*Different, louder sound effects are used for the opening of the X-Wing's [[s-foils]].\n*The line \"Blast it, [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs]], where are you?\" from the original stereo sound version was changed to \"Blast it, [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge]], where are you?\" to fix continuity.\n*Porkins' scream when he is hit is cut out.\n*When [[Tiree/Legends|Tiree's]] Y-wing explodes, there is an additional explosion sound. This also appears in the 6-track mix.\n*Sound effects for Red Leader's damaged X-wing engine were added before his crash.\n*The voices announcing the progress of the Death Star's journey to Yavin 4 is different.\n\n'''1981 Re-release'''\n*For the 1981 re-release, the line \"Episode IV: A NEW HOPE\" was added to the opening crawl. While this is the most noticeable alteration, the entire opening crawl was redone. A new starfield was used, one that was made and used in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', the \"Star Wars\" title is also from ''The Empire Strikes Back'', but it fades out before the crawl starts. The crawl was reformatted for the music to stay in synchronization and the word \"rebel\" in \"rebel spies\" is capitalized, which was not capitalized in the original 1977 crawl. The ''Tantive IV'' and Star Destroyer were recomposited with finer border, removing some prominent black lines. More subtly, the lasers and engine glows were adjusted to fit and the moons are in different positions relative to the planet<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://plus.google.com/photos/+DrewStewart/albums/5514974191245813441/5537299919619902914?pid=5537299919619902914&oid=102542760950977079734|text=Star Wars Special Edition Changer HD|work=Google Plus|archivedate=20160919231557}}</ref>.\n\n====''The Empire Strikes Back''====\nThe 70mm version of the film was slightly different from the 35mm version that was more widely seen. It is understood that when the movie was considered \"finished,\" the elements were turned over to the lab and sound facilities so the desired 70mm print order could be prepared. The filmmakers, however, decided to make a few, albeit subtle, changes that, considering the expense and time involved in re-striking and and/or re-sounding 70mm prints, were reflected only in the film's 35mm prints. A couple of these differences can be found on the Ken Films Super 8 version of the film. An in-theater recording of the audio exists (made by the same person who made a recording of the 70mm showing of Star Wars) while only the first 4 minutes of video exist thanks to a CBS outlet. Some of the audio differences are likely because the in-theater records captured the discreet left and right channels where the 35mm release and subsequent home video used the matrixed Dolby Stereo track.\n\n'''70mm Visual Differences'''\n*After the Probot lands and moves left, there is an optical wipe to the overhead shot of Luke on his Tauntaun. \n*After Luke wanders through the snow and falls face down, there is an optical wipe to Han instead of a straight cut.\n*The bacta tank scene starts on a close-up of Two-One-Bee and pans right to a closeup of Luke in the tank. It then cuts to FX-7 extending its arm to the tank. There is no cut to Leia, Han and Threepio observing. \n*In the Hoth battle scene, when Luke drops into the snow after throwing a charge into the AT-AT walker, the AT-ST in the background has no atmospheric depth.\n*The Emperor's hologram does not fade in at the start of his conversation with Vader.*\n*Millennium Falcon sensor dish is not visible with Luke on weather vane. The position of the vane is also different on the background.*\n*The final scene begins with the first establishing shot of the rebel fleet, then cuts inside the Millennium Falcon for Lando to say, \"Luke, we're ready for take-off\" (but a different take of this was used). After Luke says (voice over), \"Good luck, Lando\" the scene cuts to inside the medical bay where Luke says, \"I'll meet you at the rendezvous on Tatooine\" etc. Not in this version are two more establishing shots of the fleet and an interim effects shot over which Lando says, \"When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter we'll contact you.\".*\n*The atmospheric glow of the Hoth and Dagobah planets during their establishing shots is not present. \n\nFound On:\n*8mm Ken Films Print\n\n'''70mm Audio Differences'''\n*When Luke runs out of the wampa cave, there is a sound of his lightsaber deactivating even though it stays lit onscreen; this error later re-appeared in the Special Edition.\n*Different laser fire can be heard during the snow battle, the sound used for TIE fighters instead of X-wings.\n*When R2 is being loaded into Luke's X-wing, C-3PO says the word \"and\" before saying \"do take good care of yourself.\" The 2004 DVD audibly cranks up the quiet \"and\".\n*Yoda says the word \"Run!\" before \"Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the force.\" The following lines \"But beware the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side of the force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight\" are also much louder and clearer.\n*The Imperial fleet establishing shot after the scene of Luke's failure at the cave has a different TIE fighter sound effect. (Can also be heard on the foreign GOUT-tracks, SE versions have the music as originally composed for the scene)\n*The atmospheric reverb of Ben Kenobi's voice is mixed differently.\n*In Cloud City, after C-3PO says \"That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if it...\" he says \"Hello?\" twice instead of once.\n*While C-3PO is on Chewbacca's back when they enter the carbon freezing chamber, the line \"Now remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish\" is louder and heard more clearly.\n*Lando's line at the end, \"Luke, we're ready for takeoff.\" is a different take. (The same take can be heard in the Special Edition).\n*Lando's line \"When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.\" is not present.\n*Lando's line \"Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.\" is a different take.\n*In the final scene, there is no tracked music from \"Yoda and the Force\".\n\n''' 35mm Mono Audio Differences'''\n\nIn addition to the differences between the 35 mm Dolby Stereo and 70 mm 6 track audio, there was also a separate mono mix that had a few changes. It was found on a 16 mm print but likely was also distributed on 35 mm prints.\n*In the asteroid field, after C-3PO says \"Oh, this is suicide\", the line \"There's nowhere to go\" was added.\n*Yoda lets out a frightened \"ahh!\" after Luke initially points his blaster at him.\n*In Cloud City, after C-3PO says \"That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if it...\" he says \"Hello?\" only once instead of twice.\n*While C-3PO is on Chewie's back when they enter the carbon freezing chamber, the line \"Oh dear, what now?\" is added to the beginning of C-3PO's dialog.\n*When Darth Vader falls off the carbon freeze platform he grunts instead of saying \"Argh\".\n\n'''Alternate Audio sources'''\n\nIn addition to the differences in the 70mm edit, There is an 8mm shorter edit of the film and the audio from The Story of The Empire Strikes Back LP that contained the following differences.\n\n*Luke: \"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han 'ole buddy, do you read me?\" - Different take. *, **\n*Luke - \"I don't pick up any life readings\" - Different take *, **\n*Han - \"I'm coming back\" - Different take instead of the more widely heard \"I'm going back\" *, **\n*Rogue 2: \"Captain Solo, do you copy?\" - Different take *\n*Leia: \"They're getting closer.\" - Different take *\n*Han: \"Oh, yeah? Watch this.\" - Different take *\n*Obi-Wan's lines are not as 'echoed'.*\n*The Cloud Car Pilots have alternate dialogue - \"Any aggressive move will not be tolerated!\" \"Permission granted to land on platform 3-2-7. Any deviation from...\" \"Thank you!\"-Han cuts off comlink.*\n*After Lando tells Han, \"Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price of success.\" The 8mm continues \"And you know what, Han, you were right all along. It's over-rated.\" as C-3PO talks with the other protocol droid.*\n*More crowd noise as people flee Cloud City.*\nFound On:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> 8mm Ken Films Print\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> The Story of The Empire Strikes Back LP\n\n====''Return of the Jedi''====\n''Return of the Jedi'' was left unaltered. It did feature 70mm 6 track, Dolby Stereo, and a mono mix, but there are no discernible differences. The Dolby Stereo mix was featured on all home video releases.\n\n===TV broadcasts and VHS/Betamax/CED editions===\nThe mono mix was used for a 1980s UK ITV broadcast. There were also some minor changes made to a few 1980's pan and scanned TV broadcasts such as squeezing in the second Tusken Raider while looking through Luke's macrobinoculars.\n\nThe original releases of ''A New Hope'' on VHS, Betamax, and RCA's CED featured the Dolby Stereo mix, identical to that heard on the 35mm theatrical prints. Playing the mix through a home Dolby Pro-logic decoder authentically recreates the original 4-channel surround experience. This mix did not contain the line uttered by C-3PO \"The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.\" This line was only present in the original mono mix. For the 1985 VHS/laserdisc releases, [[Ben Burtt]] supervised the creation of a new, digitally remastered audio track. CBS/FOX worked with the new multi-channel mix and made a new Dolby Stereo compliant downmix for home video.\n\nDue to technical and cost limitations, the CED editions of ''A New Hope'' are presented time-compressed (sped up by 3%) from its original 121-minute length to 118 minutes to fit one double-sided two-hour disc.\n\nIn the UK and throughout Europe widescreen VHS versions of the original three films were released in 1991. An advertisement before the films started explained how widescreen showed more of the picture. They were re-released in 1994 with different artwork and released a third time as THX versions in 1995.\n\nThe VHS reissue in 1995, which was the last available release of the Pre-Special Edition trilogy prior to the 2006 DVD release, utilized [[THX]] digital remastering to enhance the picture and sound quality on all three films.\n\n===LaserDisc editions===\nDue to technical limitations, most pan-and-scan versions of ''A New Hope'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' are presented time-compressed (sped up by 2% for Star Wars and 4% for Empire Strikes Back) from their respective 121- and 125-minute lengths to fit one double-sided two-hour [[Wikipedia:LaserDisc|LaserDisc]]. Letterbox versions of the original theatrical releases of the original three films have also been released.\n\nThe initial 1989 North American widescreen release of ''A New Hope'' suffered from a shrinking aspect ratio. The master that was used was the Japanese subtitled LaserDisc, in which the image appeared higher on the screen to allow for subtitles. For the North American release, it was shifted down, and a black bar was put up to cover the unused parts. However, as the film progresses, the image creeps up on the screen moving underneath the top bar, causing the image to become increasingly wider. By the time the film reaches the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] scenes, the image has widened from 2.35:1 to 2.55:1. This problem was fixed in the 1992 reissue of the disc. The original shrinking LaserDisc has the CBS/Fox logo on it, while the fixed edition has the newer Fox Video logo on the jacket. C-3PO's line about the tractor beam can be heard on this LaserDisc and the three original 1977 effects shots can be seen.\n\nIn 1993, the ''[[Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection]]'' box set was released based on the interpositives struck in 1985. This version featured the original trilogy on nine CAV discs, widescreen transfers, [[THX]] remastering, audio commentary tracks, assorted bonus features, a copy of the hardcover book ''[[George Lucas: The Creative Impulse]]'', and for ''A New Hope'', a new surround-sound audio mix. This mix, digitally remastered by Ben Burtt and Gary Summers, was supposedly a mix of the best elements of all three original mixes.<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~treadwell_jay/starwars/soundfaq.htm|text=Star Wars Sound Mix Comparison|author=Pennington, Jay|work=home.earthlink.net|archivedate=20040410204234}}</ref> However, it is primarily a fold-down of the 6-track 70mm mix, with some mono mix elements and additional elements \"dialled in.\" An interview with Dave Schnuelle, printed in a 1993 issue of [http://widescreenreview.com ''Widescreen Review'' magazine], corroborates these observations. Additionally, the transfer was somewhat sub-par, with scan lines often disappearing and colors being incorrectly switched.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://plus.google.com/photos/+DrewStewart/albums/5525747538664147553/5532320699921382498?banner=pwa&pid=5532320699921382498&oid=102542760950977079734|text=Google Plus|nobackup=1}}</ref><ref>{{WebCite|url=https://plus.google.com/photos/+DrewStewart/albums/5528361230751063825/5529747351041177362?banner=pwa&pid=5529747351041177362&oid=102542760950977079734|text=Google Plus|nobackup=1}}</ref>\n\nInitial versions of this box set were missing approximately ten seconds from ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Fox Video offered a replacement disc, and this mistake was corrected in later pressings.<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://dvdscan.com/starwarsld.htm|text=Star Wars Lucas DVD LD Laserdisc Review and comparison|archivedate=20020321045533}}</ref>\n\nThe final LaserDisc edition of the original trilogy was released in 1995, sourced from the 1993 masters.<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://www.echostation.com/features/videoversions.htm|text=This is Madness!|archivedate=20160510092911}}</ref>\n\n===1997 [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Star Wars Trilogy Special Editions]]===<!-- section title referenced in other articles -->\nIn [[1997]], Episodes IV, V, and VI were re-mastered and theatrically re-released as the \"Special Editions.\" For the re-release, in addition to extensive clean-up and restoration work, Lucas also made a number of changes to the films in order to \"finish the film the way it was meant to be\" (as Lucas said in a September 2004 interview with Associated Press).\n\nMany of Lucas' changes for the Special Editions were cosmetic, generally adding special effects which weren't originally possible. Other changes, however, are considered to have affected plot or character development. These changes, such as the change referred to by fans as \"[[Han shot first]],\" have proven to be controversial. The \"Han shot first\" situation can be generally described as this: in the original release of Episode IV, the character Han Solo shoots and kills a bounty hunter named [[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]], after Greedo threatens to kill him in order to collect a bounty which had been placed on Solo's head by [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. In the Special Edition of the film, however, Greedo shoots first at close range. Only after he misses does Solo return fire. [[George Lucas]] has been quoted in ''Entertainment Weekly'' as saying that this version of the scene was meant to be the original, as in the original storyboards (Greedo fires first at Han Solo).\n*In 2000, this version had box art redesigned to match the Box Art of Episodes I\u2013III except the front of the box was white for Episodes IV and VI while Episode V retained the black used for the Prequel box art. Also the Star Wars logos on Episodes IV\u2013VI used the logo design as featured for Episodes I\u2013III. This was done to create a more uniform look for all 6 movies.\n\n[[#External links|Special coverage on CNN in 1997]] notes that Lucas spent $10 million to rework his original 1977 film, which was roughly what it cost to film it originally. $3 million of that was spent on the audio track for the special edition. Lucas also spent $2.5 million each on Episodes V and VI.\n\nThe following is a partial list of changes aside from overall audio and visual alterations:\n\n====''A New Hope''====\n*The \"A long time ago\" card was re-created using a different font.\n*The opening crawl has been recomposed again using the original 1977 starfield and positions of the moons. The ''Tantive IV'' and Star Destroyer were recomposited again, using different engine glow effects.\n*The sunset over the canyon R2-D2 travels down has been enhanced and lengthened and the canyon scene has been darkened.\n*A revised [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Sandcrawler/Legends|sandcrawler]] has the sky darkened and with a few scattered stars.\n*The shot of the sandcrawler coming over the rise was reshot using the original model. The new shot is longer and closer with the camera panning to follow the sandcrawler.\n*A new digital matte painting of the sandcrawler and extended sky were added when the Jawas are setting up shop in front of the Lars farm. Artificial zooming in is also present. More vaporators have been added, but they disappear in subsequent shots.\n[[File:Stormtrooper_Search.png|thumb|right|250px|New, extended shot of the stormtrooper search for the Death Star plans.]]\n*Extended shot of the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]' search for the missing droids with additional troopers riding [[Dewback/Legends|dewbacks]]. A [[Sentinel-class landing craft/Legends|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] can be seen taking off, and new (costumed) stormtroopers have been added to the scene.\n*The Lars dinner scene has a slight audio manipulation from Aunt Beru: \"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.\" There is a slight pause before she says \"father,\" and the word \"father\" is changed to sound more worrisome.\n*Shots of the landspeeder in motion have been enhanced to improve the shadow and make it look further off the ground.\n*The long shot of Luke's landspeeder in the canyon, with the two Tusken Raiders taking aim, has been improved. Now instead of being merely a moving white \"blob,\" the landspeeder is visible in minute detail.\n*New CG shot of [[Ben Kenobi's home/Legends|Ben Kenobi's hut]] replaces a previous shot of the landspeeder parked near [[Ajim]].\n*When Luke swings his father's lightsaber in Ben's hut, the effect has been redone.\n*The far shot of Mos Eisley spaceport shows a ship taking off from the ground.\n[[File:Mos_Eisley.png|thumb|right|250px|Extended view of Mos Eisley spaceport.]]\n*[[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] is bigger and busier with an extended opening showing dinosaur-like [[Ronto/Legends|rontos]] and the original speeder that would have been in the first version, featuring slapstick [[ASP-series labor droid/Legends|ASP droids]] in front of [[Dash Rendar/Legends|Dash Rendar's]] ship, the [[Outrider/Legends|''Outrider'']], followed by a short pause of the camera as a Jawa gets bucked from its Ronto mount. Two stormtroopers can also be seen in a far shot standing watch.\n*Due to color timing errors, a \"pink glow\" was apparent in many of the new Tatooine scenes, including the extended entry into Mos Eisley.\n*The dewback standing outside the cantina is animated and when the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] arrive one is shown dismounting from one as C-3PO says, \"I don't like the look of this.\"\n*A [[Mark IV sentry droid/Legends|Mark IV sentry droid]] has been digitally added to two scenes with Imperial stormtroopers on Tatooine.\n*New aliens are seen in the cantina replacing the \"Wolfman\" characters in two shots, though the [[Defel/Legends|Defel]] still appears in the cantina. Although these new characters look different from each other, they are actually both portrayed by the same mask. The mask was just turned around backwards for the second creature.\n*Han's last line to Greedo, \"Yes, I'll bet you have,\" was edited to a calmer \"I'll bet you have.\"\n[[File:Greedo_shoots_first.png|thumb|right|250px|Greedo shoots first (and misses) in the 1997 special edition of ''A New Hope''.]]\n*[[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]] now fires an inaccurately aimed shot at [[Han Solo/Legends|Han]] before being shot in the cantina while Han bobs his head slightly to \"dodge\" the shot. (This change [[Han shot first|caused a great uproar in the community]], and thousands of fans complained.)\n\n*A CGI version of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] confronts [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] in the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]{{'s}} launch bay, replacing [[Declan Mulholland|a Human actor]] from a deleted scene that is now re-inserted after the Greedo scene. New dialogue was recorded in the [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]] language for this scene. Also, [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] has been added to the scene as a bystander and in one scene a close-up.\n*A new Mos Eisley scene of the ''Falcon'' taking off with troopers firing upon it. The angle of the ''Falcon'' flying off has also been adjusted.\n*Large [[Wikipedia:Praxis effect|Praxis-effect]] shockwaves from the destruction of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] and the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] have been added, and Alderaan's explosion itself redone.\n*The Death Star docking bay is revised to be more consistent with the one seen in ''Return of the Jedi'', most notably in the overhead shot when the ''Millennium Falcon'' has landed.\n*The flashes of blaster impacts on the Imperial officers' chests were censored in all but one shot\n*C-3PO's line where he describes the [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam's]] power systems is put back in.\n*When Han Solo and Chewbacca are chasing a squad of stormtroopers on the Death Star, instead of running to a dead end with more stormtroopers, the pair end up at a hangar bay with seemingly hundreds of stormtroopers and officers. Laser fire was increased in the next scene where [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] approaches the corner.\n*\"Close the blast doors!\" is put back into the scene where Han and Chewbacca jump through the doors as they close.\n*A digital version of a shot of the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] flying below the planet [[Yavin Prime/Legends|Yavin]] towards [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]].\n*A scene between [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]], just before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. A pilot has been digitally inserted walking past the camera at one point to mask a deleted line by Red Leader (which in the script indicated that he knew Luke's father and his reputation as a pilot).\n[[File:Battle_of_Yavin.png|thumb|right|250px|New CG shot of the Alliance fighters leaving Yavin 4 to destroy the Death Star.]]\n*New CGI shots of the X-wings and Y-wings taking off from [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] (in the original version, they just appeared as white dots) and assembling in front of the Death Star.\n*New, additional, and revised [[Starfighter combat/Legends|dogfighting]] and attack run scenes during the battle with the Death Star.\n*After Red Leader's unsuccessful trench run, the line \"He's on your tail!\" was added to the film.\n*The shot of the Rebel fighters flying to the Death Star and away from the Death Star has been revised.\n*Some [[Wikipedia:Garbage matte|garbage matte]] boxes around starships in space were removed (while others still remained).\n*Several explosions were [[Wikipedia:Compositing|recomposited]] to remove black borders and other artifacts.\n*When the Death Star explodes, a new digital shockwave was added.\n*During the victory celebration, as Luke, Han and Chewbacca enter the assembly hall, Rebel soldiers standing on the sides were a matte painting in the original; they have now been replaced with actors composited in.\n*James Earl Jones was added to the credits as the voice of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].\n*\"[[Star Wars Main Title|Luke's Theme]]\" is partially repeated in the ending credits music to allow time for the added Special Edition release credits.\n*In addition, most of the wipes were optically recomposited to improve quality.\n\n====''The Empire Strikes Back''====\n*New scenes on [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] with a fiercer-looking [[Wampa/Legends|wampa]] ice creature (man in a suit), including showing the wampa screeching in agony following the loss of its limb.

This is corrected and the fighters continue heading toward the Death Star.\n*In the original version, as the Ewoks commence their counterattack, two Ewoks play each of the first two melody lines of Aaron Copland's \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" on their horns. In subsequent releases, what the second Ewok is playing is replaced by the first melody line of \"Fanfare...\" a whole step down from the other, as heard later at the movie right before Luke makes a funeral pyre for his father's armor. It is not known whether this change was meant to avoid copyright issues, and Copland died before the 1997 Special Edition was made.\n*As with the destruction of the first Death Star, the second has been given a shockwave ring.\n*At the end of the trilogy after the Empire is defeated, in addition to [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], scenes of celebration on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]], [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], and [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] are shown. In the Coruscant scene, a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] can be seen being \"crowd-surfed\" against his will and uttering the infamous [[Wilhelm scream]]. The \"[[Ewok Celebration]]\" song (often referred to as \"Yub Nub\") during this sequence has been replaced with an entirely new John Williams composition, \"[[Victory Celebration]].\"\n**The idea of this concept was discussed during the actual pre-production of Return of the Jedi.<ref>''[[Star Wars in 100 Scenes]]''</ref>\n*A few quick shots of the Ewoks celebrating by campfires and with different musical instruments (horns) have been added.\n*During the end celebration, a brief shot of Luke hugging [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] was inserted.\n*The Force ghost scene has been edited. In the original version, there is a medium shot of the ghosts of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda, cut to a shot of Luke rejoining his friends, and then another long shot of Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda. In the Special Edition, the medium shot is split in two by the shot of Luke rejoining his friends. After the medium shot, there is another cut to Luke, and then a cut to the long shot of the ghosts.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://plus.google.com/photos/+DrewStewart/albums/5528361230751063825/5741754377515978098?banner=pwa&pid=5741754377515978098&oid=102542760950977079734|text=Google Plus|nobackup=1}}</ref>\n*\"Parade of the Ewoks\" is repeated in the ending credits music to make room for the new Special Edition release credits.\n\n===2004 [[Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)|Star Wars Trilogy DVD]]===<!-- section title referenced in other articles -->\nIn 2004, in addition to an extensive and comprehensive hi-definition digital cleanup and restoration job by Lowry Digital, the [[original trilogy]] films were changed once again for their release on DVD. In these new versions of the films, a few changes which had been made for the 1997 Special Editions were removed. Even more changes were made to the films, however. With this release, Lucasfilm created a new high-definition master of the films, which will be used in future releases as well. Its sound mix was a combination of the first SE mix and the original mono mix.\n\nOne of the most notable of these new changes includes new footage shot during the filming of ''Revenge of the Sith'' of [[Ian McDiarmid]] portraying Palpatine, which has been inserted into ''The Empire Strikes Back'', replacing the original performance (voiced by actor [[Clive Revill]] and portrayed by [[Marjorie Eaton]], wearing a specially made mask) recorded for the film. Another notable and quite controversial change was to a scene at the end of Episode VI, when the spirits of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]], and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] look upon the Rebels' celebration. The original actor who played Anakin in this scene ([[Sebastian Shaw]]) was replaced by [[Hayden Christensen]], the actor who played Anakin in Episodes II and III.\n\nIn 2005, the 2004 Special Editions were again released on DVD; however, this time they were repackaged and sold as a three-disc set that did not include the bonus materials disc. This was done to provide a more affordable trilogy set.\n\nThe 2004 DVD changes were made in an attempt to make a better connection between the old and new trilogies. The 2004 DVD releases also received John D. Lowry's digital restoration visual enhancement treatment.<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/3945149.stm|text=Macs do Star Wars dirty work|archivedate=20230903212528}}</ref> The following is a partial\nlist of changes:\n\n====All films====\n*The \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\" card in the [[opening crawl]] has been replaced with the card from [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Attack of the Clones'']].\n\n====''A New Hope''====\n*Darth Vader's voice filter was changed to match the rest of the saga.\n*A buzz is now heard when R2-D2 opens the escape pod aboard ''Tantive IV''.\n*When the Jawa Sandcrawler stops outside the Lars Homestead, C-3PO says \"We've stopped\" before telling R2-D2 to wake up. He also says \"Wake up!\" an additional time.\n*[[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] scream to scare off the Sand People has been changed to a higher-pitched wail. The new version of Kenobi's scream in the 2004 version sounds similar to a [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]] (first seen in [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']]). This is similar to the sound that Boga on Utapau in [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']] makes. Previously the sound had a [[Dewback/Legends|dewback]] roar tacked onto the end.\n*A brief shot of Luke's landspeeder as it enters [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] carrying Luke, Ben Kenobi, and the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] has been redone.\n*The odd \"pink glow\" is removed from the extended Mos Eisley entrance sequence (which includes what is described in the precedent entry).\n[[File:Greedo_shoots_first.png|thumb|right|250px|Han and Greedo shoot at approximately the same time in the 2004 Special Edition of ''A New Hope'', but Greedo still shoots a few frames faster.]]\n*The Han/Greedo scene is redone yet again, so that Greedo and Han shoot at almost exactly the same moment, but Greedo is still fractionally ahead. Han also dodges Greedo's shot by moving to his right in the new version in a slightly more lifelike manner. In addition, Han's original \"Yes, I'll bet you have\" line was restored, but was moved to a few frames earlier.\n*After Han shoots Greedo, a frying sizzle can be heard.\n[[File:Jabba-ANH.png|thumb|250px|The new CG Jabba model from the 2004 Special Edition of ''A New Hope''.]]\n[[File:HanJabbaDockingBay94.png|250px|thumb|New scene with a redone computer generated model of Jabba.]]\n*An improved CGI version of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] now confronts [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] in the scene added to the 1997 re-release. This new version more closely resembles the way Jabba looked in Episode I.\n*During the dialogue between Tarkin and Leia, their voices change modulation noticeably mid-sentence, and Leia's lines exhibit background hiss whenever she speaks.\n*When Luke trains with his lightsaber on the ''Falcon'', several shots are very green. The others remain very pale like they were originally.\n*The line \"There's no one here\" has been added as the stormtroopers are searching the ''Falcon''.\n*When the docking bay controller tries to contact [[TK-421/Legends|TK-421]], slightly audible static can be heard over the communicator.\n*The detail on Vader's chest has been digitally rotoscoped in one shot for unknown reasons.\n*The matte painting in the [[Detention Block AA-23/Legends|detention block]] has been extended, making the corridor seem longer. The painting's perspective has been edited to make it appear more realistic.\n*The [[Dianoga/Legends|dianoga's]] eye stalk that pops up over the water to spy on the heroes has been modified so that it blinks.\n*The English lettering in the Death Star tractor beam control panel (\"POWER - TRACTOR BEAM 12 (SEC. N6)\" and \"INOPERATIVE\") is changed to [[Aurebesh/Legends|Aurebesh]] lettering. The word \"INOPERATIVE\" is truncated out of the full-screen DVD version.\n*An audible bump was added to the infamous gaffe where the stormtrooper on the screen-right bumps his head on the door-frame when they break into the control room. This mistake was alluded to in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|Episode II]] when [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]], escaping from Obi-Wan on Kamino, bangs his helmet on the closing door of the [[Slave I/Legends|''Slave I'']].\n*Luke and Leia's voice echo when they are trapped in the Death Star chasm has been redone more realistically.\n*There are also several lightsaber mistakes visible in the battle between Obi-Wan and Vader, such as their lightsabers changing color, and Obi-Wan's missing its core, plus a few far shots still show uncolored lightsabers.\n*As the blast door closes after Luke blasts the controls, Darth Vader's lightsaber glow was added.\n*[[John Williams]]' score has been quieted or eliminated from some portions of the Battle of Yavin scene, such as \"The Force Theme\" when the X-wings make their first attack run which is now drowned out by the loud engines (except on the French audio track).\n*One line in the Biggs' reunion scene (\"How d'you get here?\") is no longer cut mid-sentence. This was likely a mistake in the 1997 Special Edition.\n*The \"He's on your tail!\" that was added for the 1997 Special Edition was removed.\n*The shot of the Y-wings descending to make the first attack run has been fixed. Originally, the two lead Y-wings disappeared too early, and only the third Y-wing exited the frame properly. Now all three move smoothly out of frame.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://plus.google.com/photos/+DrewStewart/albums/5514974191245813441/5514976032573606402?banner=pwa&pid=5514976032573606402&oid=102542760950977079734|text=Google Plus|nobackup=1}}</ref>\n*The credits are unchanged from the 1997 Special Edition, except that the format was changed to make it more in line with the credits roll of the prequel trilogy.\n*The left and right surround channels of the score have been swapped. 20th Century Fox claims these and other audio changes are \"deliberate creative decisions\" and not mistakes.<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://jwfan.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=558|text=Unknown article|nobackup=1}}</ref>\n*Due to color timing issue, the entire movie has a magenta tint, especially noticeable in skin tones and explosions. Several segments show heavier color correction, especially the early shots of C-3PO and R2-D2 on the blockade runner. the entire film is oversaturated with many of the reds, greens, and blues nearly glowing, in particular, R2-D2 and R5-D4. The explosions recomposed for the 1997 theatrical release are all muted instead of bright.\n\n====''The Empire Strikes Back''====\n*The wording in the opening credits has subtle transparency errors.\n*Due to color timing issues, the explosion accompanying the destruction of the shield generator appears with a strange tint of green and purple.\n*At least one shot of R2-D2 in space has been modified with CGI recoloring to make him have blue panels instead of black (the blue screen technique in the original film removed all color from the droid). With the new coloring, his black central \"eye\" appears much smaller than normal. Despite this fix, R2-D2's domes appear black in several other shots throughout this release of the trilogy.\n*In the original and special edition, when Darth Vader asks if the ''Falcon''{{'s}} hyperdrive is deactivated, [[Firmus Piett/Legends|Admiral Piett's]] rank plaque and code cylinders are on the wrong side of his uniform (the plaque is supposed to be on the left side of his tunic, but it was on his right side). This is corrected and Piett has the correct rank placement on his uniform. The same was done for another officer in the same shot.\n*Due to color timing issues, Yoda appears much more green than in previous versions.\n\n[[File:Emperor_Palpatine_DVD_Empire_Strikes_Back.jpg|thumb|250px|McDiarmid as Palpatine.]]\n*In a scene where [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] speaks to the Emperor via [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]], the Emperor is now [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] as portrayed by [[Ian McDiarmid]] (in the original film and the Special Edition, [[Marjorie Eaton]], wearing a specially made mask with chimpanzee's eyes superimposed over her own portrayed the Emperor, whose voice was dubbed in by [[Clive Revill]].) A few lines of new dialogue have been added to this scene as well, in which Palpatine informs Vader that their new enemy is \"the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.\"\n[[File:Emperor_TESB_1980.png|thumb|180px|The theatrical version of Palpatine in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.]]\n*The four lines spoken by [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] (Originally in the voice of [[Jason Wingreen]]) are now in the voice of [[Temuera Morrison]], the actor who played [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]] (Boba Fett's clone \"father\"). The engine sounds of his ship, [[Slave I/Legends|''Slave I'']], have also been modified to sound as they did in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']].\n*The odd \"pink glow\" on the scene where the Cloud Car is replaced by the Tibanna refinery in the Special Edition version is removed.\n*In both the original and Special Edition versions of the film, during the scene in which Han is lowered into the carbon-freezing chamber, a shadow on the actor's clothing has given rise to a rumored (but false) wardrobe blooper of him wearing his dark jacket during one shot (behind the scenes shots of the scene dispel the rumor). The \"jacket\" has been digitally erased in this release.\n*Due to color timing issues, Darth Vader's lightsaber in the Luke/Vader duel now looks pink instead of red in almost all the shots it is in (this problem is also in the Episode VI lightsaber duel as well). It also changes to orange in a few shots (when Vader leaps at Luke in their duel in the Carbon freezing chamber, and when they encounter in the cave on Dagobah).\n*The tracked Emperor death scream by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] introduced in the Special Edition re-release, which is heard during Luke's voluntary fall from the Cloud City platform after his fight with Vader, was removed.\n*The credits are unchanged from the 1997 Special Edition. Consequently, [[Clive Revill]] remains credited as the voice of the Emperor, despite being replaced by McDiarmid, who remains uncredited.\n\n====''Return of the Jedi''====\n*The matte lines on the rancor have been completely erased and the blue screen glow on the figure of Luke has been removed, with the colors being retimed to match, making the two appear to be in the same scene together.\n*The effects of the scene from the interior of the Imperial shuttle have been again improved, as to further decrease the transparency, which caused the Forest Moon of Endor to be seen through the cockpit in earlier releases.\n*At the beginning of the duel between Luke and Vader, in the scene where their sabers clash in front of the Emperor's face, the scene has been noticeably darkened. The lowered brightness hides the \"Emperor's slugs\" gaffe (dark colored blobs on the actor's hood to cover gaps in the makeup). This darkening makes the lightsabers appear to intersect, and makes it appear that Vader's saber is in front of Luke's, suggesting that he was trying to kill his master rather than defend him (this is of course an unintended consequence of the gaffe).\n*Vader's lightsaber appears pink or red-violet in several scenes, then changes back to the normal red (compare the shot where he is searching for Luke who is hiding, versus most of their fight prior).\n*In [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker's]] final scene, when he is not wearing his helmet, the eyebrows of actor [[Sebastian Shaw]] have been digitally removed. This is meant to indicate what happens to Anakin's eyebrows when he gets burned alive on [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]] after the [[Duel on Mustafar/Legends|duel]] with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. His eyes have also been changed to blue, to better resemble the Anakin portrayed by [[Hayden Christensen]] in the prequel trilogy. His skin tone has also been altered so it appears gray and colorless, instead of fleshy and pale like it was previously (also compare to his exposed head in ''Empire Strikes Back'').\n*Another scene of celebration, this one on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], is shown after the Empire is defeated, some Gungans partake in the celebration, and one is heard chanting \"Wesa free!\", Some Star Wars fans believe that this is [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]] even though it is not Jar Jar's voice.\n*In the Coruscant celebration scene, the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] building can be seen in the distance at the start of the shot, and the [[Jedi Temple/Legends|Jedi Temple]] can be seen at the end. These replaced generic buildings that appeared in the 1997 Special Edition. This is meant to indicate that the Jedi Temple was not destroyed during the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]].\n[[File:JediGhosts-ROTJ.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Hayden Christensen]] (left) as the spirit of Anakin Skywalker.]]\n*In the final scene where the spirits of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] appear to [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]], the Sebastian Shaw (as Anakin) has been replaced by Hayden Christensen. Only the head was replaced, but the rest of Anakin's body has been digitally altered to look more like Hayden Christensen, however, the details that show through from the background are identical in every respect revealing that only Hayden's head was used while it is still Sebastian Shaw's body. Lucas has said that the reason he made this change was because after redemption, Anakin returned to his \"inner persona,\" once one with the Force, and appeared the way he was before he turned to the dark side of the Force.\n[[File:Spirits_copy1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sebastian Shaw]] (left) as the ghost of Anakin Skywalker.]]\n*Note that in all three films, the ending credits have remained unchanged from the Special Edition releases in 1997. Thus, they do not reflect such changes as Ian McDiarmid's Emperor in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' or Hayden Christensen's Anakin in ''Return of the Jedi''.\n\n===2006 DVD release===\nOn [[September 12]], [[2006]], the original trilogy was re-released on DVD for a limited time (until [[December 31]], 2006). Each film (Episodes ''IV'', ''V'', and ''VI'') is packaged as a two-disc set with the first disc presenting the 2004 Special Edition with remastered THX sound and picture and the second disc containing the \"original, unaltered theatrical release\" of each film as \"bonus material\".\n\nThese original editions are presented as they were first shown theatrically. For example, ''Star Wars'' has the 1977 opening scroll (before \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" was added and other adjustments made for the [[April 10]], [[1981]] re-issue). Though the original features are presented in Dolby 2.0 Surround audio, the video transfer is derived not from original masters, but from the 1993 Laserdisc transfer (aside from the original Episode IV opening scroll taken from a best available original 1977 print), meaning that the film's 2.39:1 Panavision format is letterboxed into a non-anamorphic 4:3 video frame, even for widescreen television playback.<ref name=\"PRRep\">{{WebCite|url=http://www.originaltrilogy.com/Lucasfilm_PR_response.cfm|text=Lucasfilm's PR Response Regarding the 2006 DVD Box Set|archivedate=20131225052916}}</ref><ref name=\"DPM\">{{Blogspot|subdomain=dpm|url=2006/06/art-is-never-finished-merely-abandoned.html|name=Dreaded Purple Master|text=Art is never finished, merely abandoned}}</ref>\n\nInstead of using the original theatrical sound mixes, the \"bonus\" DVD presentations use the 1993 laserdisc remixes. However, the Spanish and French audio tracks on the ''Star Wars'' DVD appear to be based on the original theatrical mono sound mix for the film, ''not'' the Definitive Collection version. Certain sound effects from the 1993 mix are missing (such as all of the \"exploding glass\" sounds when Luke and Han blast the various cameras and such in the Death Star's detention center), and certain sounds have been added (such as metallic clicks when [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] press buttons on the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]{{'s}} holographic chessboard). [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] also says \"Blast it, ''Wedge'', where are you?\" during the final battle on the alternate language tracks, something he only said in the theatrical mono mix. In all other versions of the film, he says, \"Blast it, ''Biggs'', where are you?\"\n\nThe French and Spanish audio tracks for [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''The Empire Strikes Back'']] 2006 DVD also feature a different sound mix than the 1993 Definitive Collection mix. This alternate mix features additional sounds that were not heard on the 35mm and subsequent home video versions, but which were later reincorporated into the 1997 and 2004 mixes. Such sounds include additional [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] beeps when Yoda rummages through Luke's supplies, which are missing from prior mixes, and additional [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter/Legends|TIE Fighter]] engine sounds in the establishing shot of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] (after [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] beheads the illusory Vader on [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]]), which are missing from the prior sound mixes.\n\n===2011 Blu-ray release===\nIn 2004, Lucasfilm's then-Vice President of Marketing [[Jim Ward]] speculated on future releases: \"As the technology evolves and we get into a high-definition platform that is easily consumable by our customers, the situation is much better, but there will always be work to be done.\"<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://www.apple.com/pro/film/lowry/starwars/index2.html|text=Three Months and 600 Macs|author=John D.

Most notably during the shot where Vader and Luke cross blades in front of the Emperor.\n*The \"Emperor slugs\" have been removed when the restoration team was working on the lightsabers of that shot.\n*Vader screams \"NO!\" in anger before he tosses the Emperor down the hole.\n\n===2015 Digital Movie Collection===\n*The 20th Century Fox Fanfare was removed from ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi''. The ending of the track \"The Rebel Fleet/End Title\" from ''The Empire Strikes Back'' now plays over the Lucasfilm logo. ''A New Hope'' retained the fanfare, as 20th Century Fox owned permanent distribution rights to the film until the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney in 2019.\n\n===2019 Disney+ 4K restoration===\nCoinciding with the launch of [[Disney+]] on November 12, 2019, previously unannounced 4K versions of all films were released to the service. The restorations began in 2010 when George Lucas intended to restore the films for a 3D release, but the plans were shelved after Disney purchased Lucasfilm in 2012. The new restorations correct many of the digital video noise reduction (DVNR) and color correction issues that plagued the DVD and Blu-ray releases. Beyond those fixes, most of the changes from previous releases are left intact. These restorations were later released on 4K Blu-ray as part of the ''Skywalker Saga'' box set on April 10, 2020.\n\n====All films====\n*The 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare have been restored for ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', due to the Disney-Fox merger earlier that year. For these versions as well as ''A New Hope'', the 1994 logo is used minus the News Corporation byline. The 1997 Lucasfilm logo has also been replaced by the 2015 logo.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\">{{WebCite|url=https://thedigitalbits.com/featured/articles/sw-new-hope-disneyplus-4k-2019|text=Star Wars: A New Hope \u2013 A Visual Guide to Changes, Fixes, and Tweaks in the Disney+ 4K Version|author=Hunt, Bill|date=2019-12-04|archivedate=20200820014238}}</ref>\n*After having been replaced in the 2004 DVD release with the card from ''Attack of the Clones'', the original \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...\" card before the [[opening crawl]] has been restored (''A New Hope'' is the 1997 recreation).<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*The aspect ratio has been changed slightly from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1.\n\n====''A New Hope''====\n*Various shots throughout the film were recomposited or had effects slightly altered to appear properly in 4K.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*When R2-D2 and C-3PO part company in the desert, the clouds in the final long shot over C-3PO have been changed again.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*The color of the sky when Luke looks out at the Tatooine suns was redone. It now appears more solidly pink as opposed to pink and blue like in the 2004 version.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*A mistake from the 1997 version showing a transparent Luke visible in a doorway in the Lars homestead was removed.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*A fly which landed on the camera lens during a shot of Owen in the Lars homestead was digitally removed from the picture.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*The shadows cast on R2-D2 by the rocks added in the 2011 Blu-ray release were redone to give a greater sense of depth.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*The shot of the CG landspeeder entering Mos Eisley was slightly altered to position the landspeeder more to the right.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*A new edit to the Han/Greedo confrontation has a new shot of Greedo saying \"ma klounkee,\" which roughly translates to \"I'll end you\" (based on what Sebulba said to Anakin in ''The Phantom Menace'' during their first confrontation), just before he and Han fire at each other (which is now one shot towards each other at the same time). The shot of Greedo exploding has also been altered by removing the Greedo dummy and cutting earlier to the explosion cloud to give the impression that the explosion shot happened at the same angle Han and Greedo fired at each other. Disney stated that the change was done at the behest of George Lucas before the restoration was shelved following Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/greedo-han-solo-star-wars-edit|text=George Lucas Himself Gave Greedo the Last Word in Controversial New ''Star Wars'' Edit|author=Breznican, Anthony|date=2019-11-12|archivedate=20200116190523}}</ref>\n*The laser bolt fired by the training remote on board the ''Millennium Falcon'' has its color restored to red.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*Luke's lightsaber color during his training scene aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' has been fully corrected to blue.\n*Various lightsaber effects were re-done for the Vader vs. Obi-Wan duel in order to fix color errors and missing glows.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n*Some visual fixes during the Battle of Yavin that were made in the 2004 release were not replicated for the 2019 4K version, including missing Y-wings and Y-wings suddenly disappearing out of frame.<ref name=\"Digital Bits\" />\n\n====''The Empire Strikes Back''====\n*Various shots throughout the film were recomposited or had effects slightly altered to appear properly in 4K.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\">{{WebCite|url=https://thedigitalbits.com/featured/articles/sw-new-hope-disneyplus-4k-2019|text=Star Wars: A New Hope &ndash; A Visual Guide to Changes, Fixes, and Tweaks in the Disney+ 4K Version|archivedate=20200820014238}}</ref>\n*The close-up shot of the Wampa's arm swiping at Luke was slightly re-framed in order to better hide the edge of the puppeted arm.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\" />\n*The wipe from Leia and [[Carlist Rieekan|General Rieekan]] speaking in Echo Base to the Imperial fleet in space was redone.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\" />\n*The shield generator explosion was redone in order to hide the color timing error made in the 2004 version.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\" />\n*Shots of the interior of the ''Millennium Falcon'' cockpit were slightly cropped to appear tighter.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\" />\n*Luke and Vader's lightsaber colors during their duel in the Dagobah cave were redone to appear paler.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\" />\n*The window that Leia looks out in the Cloud City apartment was slightly touched up again.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\" />\n*The new smoke and sparks added to the Cloud City furnace in the 2011 Blu-ray release were touched up.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\" />\n*New artificial lighting was added to Han's CGI shoulders (added in the 2004 DVD release) before he is put into the carbon chamber.<ref name=\"Disney+ 4K\" />\n\n====''Return of the Jedi''====\n*Various shots throughout the film were recomposited or had effects altered to appear properly in 4K.<ref name=\"TDBJedi\">{{WebCite|url=https://thedigitalbits.com/featured/articles/sw-jedi-disneyplus-4k-2019|text=Star Wars: Return of the Jedi \u2013 A Visual Guide to Changes, Fixes, and Tweaks in the Disney+ 4K Version|author=Hunt, Bill|date=2020-01-29|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/ePdCc}}</ref>\n*A hole was filled in the transition between the live action element and the matte painting in the scene where Vader lands on Endor.<ref name=\"TDBJedi\" />\n*During the Luke vs. Vader duel just before Vader stumbles, a prop being manipulated by one of the production cue was briefly raised into the shot on the lower right. This has been digitally removed.<ref name=\"TDBJedi\" />\n*In the scene where Wedge races out of the reactor core towards the camera just after disabling the power regulator, the color of the explosion was visible within the engine intakes likely due to blue screen error. This has been digitally removed.<ref name=\"TDBJedi\" />\n\n==Changes to the Prequel Trilogy==\n===2001 ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' DVD===\nSeveral scenes are added or removed from the film:\n*Sebulba's introduction has two new scenes, the shot of the crowd cheering him is slightly shorter as well.\n*The introductions to some other racers are included.\n*[[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin]] now promises to Shmi that he'll be safe.\n*More shots of the pods starting up have been added.\n*Footage of the second lap in the Pod Race was reinserted.\n*A scene of Watto screaming \"SEBULBA!\" is removed.\n*An air taxi sequence was reinserted after the arrival on Coruscant.\n*The shot of [[500 Republica/Legends|500 Republica's]] base has been removed.\n\n===2002 ''Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones'' DVD===\nMost of these changes did not appear in the main theatrical release, but made it into a version shown in select digital theaters.\n\n*Several speeders were removed from a shot during the Bounty Hunter pursuit scene.\n*New dialogue added to the scene where Anakin confesses to the Tusken slaughter to Padm\u00e9.\n*Additional sparks and smoke have been added to [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett's]] jetpack shortly before his death to better present its malfunction.\n*After falling out of the gunship on [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]], a clone trooper asks if Padm\u00e9 is alright. Her alert, somewhat offended-sounding response of \"yes\" has been changed to a more realistic groggy \"Uh-huh.\"\n*Anakin's mechanical hand now holds Padm\u00e9's hand during the closing wedding sequence.\n*During their duel on Kamino a shot of Jango Fett headbutting Obi-Wan is removed from the UK and Irish version of the film.\n\n===2005 [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] DVD===\nDespite Lucasfilm's official statement that there were absolutely no changes made to the theatrical version of the film, the [[November 1]], [[2005]] DVD release of Revenge of the Sith had a few slight changes from the theatrical cut.\n\n*In the scene where a shot transitions to Vader crawling up the lava bank, a wipe from the shot of Obi-Wan and Threepio in the cockpit of Padm\u00e9's ship leaving Mustafar to Vader's mechanical hand grasping at the volcanic soil has been replaced with a straight cut to this shot from the cockpit of Padm\u00e9's ship on the DVD.\n*Vader's \"NOOO!\" has been slightly shortened.\n\n===2011 Blu-ray release===\nFor the Blu-ray and future 3-D release, ''The Phantom Menace'' went through an extensive restoration using the original digital files (although shot on film, a digital version of the movie was created back in 1999 for a short release in four theaters with digital projection). This restoration provides a clearer picture with no image magnification or artifacts, flaws which are present on the DVD release.\n\n====''The Phantom Menace''====\n[[File:Yoda_Episode_I_Canon.png|thumb|right|250px|The puppet of Yoda used in ''The Phantom Menace'' was replaced by the CGI model of Yoda used in ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith''.]]\n*The scene composition affected by image magnification in the original DVD release was restored bringing around 8% more picture to the frame.\n*[[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] [[Force speed/Legends|Force speed]] effect was redone to look more realistic.\n*A close-up shot of [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]] and [[Rune Haako/Legends|Rune Haako]] watching a viewscreen showing the Jedi escaping was replaced for a wide shot with a new effect for the screen itself.\n*The puppet version of Yoda was replaced with a CGI version as in ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith''.<ref name=\"TFN-BR\" />\n*An effects error causing Fode and Beed's hand to pass through their vest was fixed.\n*Right after Jabba the Hutt's introduction before the podrace a new voice is heard from a spectator when the camera is focused on the crowd.\n*Calls from the Senate to \"Vote now!\" when Queen Amidala puts forward a motion of no confidence have been replaced with the sound of a general uproar.\n*On Coruscant at night, on the landing platform, when Jar Jar proclaims \"Weesa Going Home!\" Anakin says \"Come on Artoo\". R2-D2's beeped reply, heard in previous versions, is absent and he does not reply.\n\n====''Attack of the Clones''====\n*During the chase on Coruscant, when Anakin and Obi-Wan pass through the power couplings, several shots are rearranged.\n*During Anakin's nightmare scene, a voice-over of Shmi crying out his name is added.\n*After Yoda saves Obi-Wan and Anakin from Dooku's falling pillar, the reaction shots of Yoda and then Anakin and Obi-Wan are moved to before the shots of Dooku escaping on his ship and Padm\u00e9 and the Clone-troopers arriving and firing at him. This edit creates an irregularity in the background music.\n\n====''Revenge of the Sith''====\n*The scene in which Obi-Wan encounters General Grievous on Utapau and the Clone Army arrives is altered, adding new dialogue from the troopers as they land on the platform.\n*The Kashyyyk headquarters rooftop was rendered to appear more significantly aged by adding moss and rust.<ref name=\"Ep III 2011 BluRay\">{{YouTube|video=IiCn0O4aF_8|text=Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith Blu-ray Changes (2011)|channel=channel/UCEtLeYkzme_Ar2kRInJ99uQ|name=\u00c1lvaro Soliz R\u00edos|archivedate=20210308172017}}</ref>\n*The transition from Padm\u00e9's ship to Vader's hand on Mustafar is changed from a straight cut back to a wipe, restoring the original theatrical release.\n\n===3-D releases===\nAt a ShoWest convention in 2005, George Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he was planning to release all six films in 3D. ''The Phantom Menace'' was released in 3-D on Februrary 10, 2012, based on the 2011 Blu-Ray master.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/george-lucas-star-wars-interview-288523|text=5 Questions With George Lucas: Controversial 'Star Wars' Changes, SOPA and 'Indiana Jones 5'|author=Block, Alex Ben|date=2012-02-09|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|The Hollywood Reporter]]|archivedate=20220208174309}}</ref> The only confirmed change was the sharpening of a magnetic wand during the podracing scene.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/12792427/may-3-d-be-with-you|text=May 3-D be with you|author=Harvey, Shannon|date=2012-02-02|work=[[Wikipedia:Yahoo!

The ending of the track \"The Rebel Fleet/End Title\" from ''The Empire Strikes Back'' now plays over the Lucasfilm logo.\n\n===2019 Disney+ 4K restoration===\nAlong with the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy was remastered in 4K for [[Disney+]] upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019. Unlike the original trilogy, which used brand-new scans for restoration, these are up-scaled versions of the digital master files used for the 2011 Blu-Ray release, with some improvements to picture quality. For ''The Phantom Menace'', visible instances of digital video noise reduction (DVNR) that were present in the Blu-ray release have been removed, restoring much of the original picture. Like the original trilogy, these restorations were released to 4K Blu-ray as part of the ''Skywalker Saga'' box set.\n\n====All films====\n*The 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare have been restored for all three prequel films due to the Disney-Fox merger earlier that year, minus the News Corporation byline. The 1997 Lucasfilm logo is replaced by the 2015 logo.\n*The aspect ratio has been changed slightly from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1.\n\n==Controversy==\nMany fans were displeased by some of the changes Lucas has made. It is the most evergreen topic for fan criticism of George Lucas and is the most broadly accepted as inspiring legitimate objections. Re-release changes were also the first major cause of the reactionary criticism phenomenon that takes a vehemently anti-Lucas stance, known as \"Lucas bashing\". Even some people associated to the franchise have come to hate these changes, such as original trilogy producer [[Gary Kurtz]], who felt that a movie is what it was at the time, which is one of his reasons for which he rails against changing movies all the time.<ref name=\"Gary's Displeasure\">{{WebCite|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/376/376873p4.html|text=An Interview with Gary Kurtz|author=P., Ken|date=2002-11-11|work=[[Wikipedia:IGN|IGN]]|archivedate=20120426114524}}</ref>\n\nGreedo shooting at Han is particularly contentious. In the 2004 Special Edition DVD set the shots are timed to occur almost simultaneously, with Greedo's shot being just a hair faster and with Solo now effectively dodging his head out of the way from the blast. However, many argue that not only should Greedo ''not'' have made his shot, but that the scene undermines Solo's character. Han's original action marked him as a tough, independent-minded character; having him respond to Greedo makes him appear weaker, though he is still nonchalant about killing him. This change was so controversial that it spanned a movement called \"[[Han shot first]],\" a retort to Lucas' assertion that Greedo shot first.\n\nThere was also controversy over Lucas' decision to place [[Hayden Christensen]] in the end scene of ''Return of the Jedi'' instead of [[Sebastian Shaw]], as well as replacing the heavy fan favorite \"Boba Fett's\" voice with [[Temuera Morrison]]'s ([[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]]). Many longtime fans feel that it's disrespectful to the original trilogy, although others feel that it helps the two trilogies flow together better.\n\nThe altering of the dialogue between the Emperor and Vader has also been criticized as creating a contradiction, since it implies Vader does not realize Luke is his son until this moment, despite his being \"obsessed\" with finding Skywalker, mentioning him by name and pursuing him for the rest of the movie until this point. Defenders have argued that the scene is an improvement because it provides another blatant example of Vader plotting against his master by playing dumb in the face of this revelation.\n\nOther fans especially missed the \"songs\" that were altered in ''Return of the Jedi'' (\"[[Lapti Nek/Legends|Lapti Nek]]\" and \"[[Ewok Celebration|Yub Nub]]\"). They point out that the new music makes the Ewok's dancing and antics seem out of place (for example the \"Stormtrooper Helmet drums\" were beat in sync with the original music in the theatrical version). Others have argued that the new flute music and pan over shots of the planets being liberated makes a more effective end to the entire saga, rather than just a celebration of the single battle. The alteration of \"Lapti Nek\" into the new \"[[Jedi Rocks/Legends|Jedi Rocks]]\" to many critics helps to undermine the serious nature and threat of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] and his evil henchmen. They characterize the new sequence as \"cartoonish,\" with overt pandering to Boba Fett \"fanboys\" by introducing superfluous shots of [[Don Bies]] in the bounty hunter suit.\n\nA final alteration, unique to the 2004 DVD release, is that of lightsaber discoloration. In the scene in Episode IV where Luke trains against the practice droid aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', his lightsaber blade is inexplicably given a faint (but distinct) green color. Also, Vader's blade, in particular, is given a \"pink\" hue throughout the original trilogy. Perhaps the largest infraction is a scene in which two blades are seen to pass \"through\" one another during the final climax of Episode VI. This appears to be the result of color balance changes for the 2004 release.<ref name=\"SSW\">{{WebCite|url=https://savestarwars.com/specialeditionfail.html|text=Can't Even Get the Special Edition Right|work=[https://savestarwars.com savestarwars.com]|archivedate=20220228111853}}</ref>\n\nOn December 9, 2005, a new set of ''Star Wars'' original trilogy DVDs were released, also with the label \"Limited Edition\". However, it was merely a repackaged and discounted version of the 2004 set with no changes, and no original versions (despite packaging that some felt was misleading in that it used the original theatrical film posters, as if to imply that these were the original versions). The set was discounted in price, with the fourth (bonus) disc from the previously released 2004 set removed.\n\nReportedly, nostalgia for the original versions of the original ''Star Wars'' Trilogy on a high quality format has driven up the demand for the Laser Disc editions of the movies released prior to 1997, as well as the proliferation of fan made DVD's, often encoded from the Laser Disc originals. How far the demand will go depends upon sales of the current \"official\" releases of the original versions of the classic trilogy on DVD.\n\nIn [[2019]], George Lucas gave his approval for the [[Wikipedia:Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to screen a non-Special Edition 70mm print of ''A New Hope'' (alongside ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''). The print in question was a negative from the United Kingdom used for the film's 1981 re-release, which featured the aforementioned opening crawl modifications.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://comicbook.com/starwars/2019/07/01/star-wars-special-edition-original-screening-70mm-rare-lucasfilm|text=George Lucas Approved Rare Pre-Special Edition Star Wars Screening|author=Cavanaugh, Patrick|date=2019-07-01|archivedate=20190702001344}}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/bts/article/f19970115/index.html|text=''A New Hope'': Special Edition - What has changed?}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-v/bts/article/f19970115/index.html|text=''The Empire Strikes Back'': Special Edition - What has changed?}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-vi/bts/article/f19970115/index.html|text=''Return of the Jedi'': Special Edition - What has changed?}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/release/video/f20060825/index.html|text=Episode IV: What Has Changed?}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-v/release/video/f20060901/index.html|text=Episode V: What Has Changed?}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-vi/release/video/f20060908/index.html|text=Episode VI: What Has Changed?}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=news/saga_bluray_restoration.html|text=The Best on Blu-ray: Restoring the Star Wars Saga for the HD Generation}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Changes in Star Wars re-releases}}\n* {{WebCite|url=http://fd.noneinc.com/secrethistoryofstarwarscom/secrethistoryofstarwars.com/savingstarwars.html|text=Saving Star Wars: The Special Edition Restoration Process and its Changing Physicality|author=Michael Kaminski|date=2009|work=The Secret History of Star Wars|archivedate=20230903212518}}\n* {{WebCite|url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-george-lucas-best-worst-special-edition-changes|text=Star Wars: 5 Special Edition Changes That Should Be Reversed (& 5 We'd Keep)|author=Leon Miller|date=2019-10-08|work=Screen Rant|archivedate=20230903212517}}\n* [https://theasc.com/magazine/starwars/ Online archive of ''Star Wars'' coverage] at ''American Cinematographer'', including interviews regarding the 1997 edition\n*[http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-one.html DVD Active - A New Hope] Differences between versions of ''A New Hope''\n*[http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-two.html DVD Active - The Empire Strikes Back] Differences between versions of ''The Empire Strikes Back''\n*[http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-three.html DVD Active - Return of the Jedi] Differences between versions of ''Return of the Jedi''\n*[http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-four.html DVD Active - The Prequel Trilogy] Differences between versions of ''The Prequel Trilogy''\n*[http://www.thedigitalbits.com/reviews3/starwarschanges.html Star Wars Trilogy - 2004 DVD Changes]\n*[http://www.bbspot.com/News/2004/02/star_wars_dvds.html Lucas Reveals Changes for Star Wars DVDs]\n*[http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/10/26/eye.ent.starwars Whose 'Star Wars' is it, anyway?]\n*[http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/20/star.changes/index.html Five major changes in the 'Star Wars' DVD]\n*[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/russdawson/mono The Starkiller's Guide to the Mono Sound Mix of Star Wars] Website about differences between the mono and original stereo version of ''A New Hope.''

    "plain_text": "real\nThe following are partial lists of changes in ''Star Wars'' re-releases. The commercial success of Star Wars has given George Lucas the opportunity to tinker with his original trilogy, now called Episode IV A New Hope, Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, and Episode VI Return of the Jedi. In a September 2004 MSNBC article, Lucas points out that the original films were \"25 or 30 percent\" of what he intended.\nMany changes were motivated by the vast improvements in CGI technology and other production techniques that occurred in the two decades after the original trilogy was produced. Other changes improved the cohesiveness among the films, and eliminated continuity errors between the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy.\nChanges to Star Wars films after the theatrical release arent always limited to the original trilogy. In the release of The Phantom Menace' DVD, two deleted portions were either partially or completely restored.\nThe original, unaltered theatrical editions were released (as bonus material) on DVD on September 12, 2006. In 2011, the latest modifications to Episodes I-VI were released on Blu-ray.\n\n\u2022 Changes to the Original Trilogy\n\n\u2022 Theatrical releases\n\nAlthough not as obvious as the 1997 Special Edition re-release of the trilogy, there were still some alterations made in 1977, 1980, and 1981.\n\n\u2022 A New Hope\n\n1977 Visual Differences\nThe earliest visual edits to the original film occurred between the initial release in May and the wider release later in 1977. The edits are minor, but noticeable. They consist of four changes. All of these changes were made before the foreign language prints were made later in 1977 and well before the last good interpositive was struck in 1985. These four shots run exactly the same length. All of them exist in the earliest bootleg video tapes and in the English 16mm prints. The original three effects shots exist in many home video English language versions released during the '80s. None of these shots are found in the Definitive Edition, Faces Edition, or 2006 bonus discs, nor are they in any of the known extant 35mm prints, or Technicolor prints.\n\u2022 When the Millennium Falcon is being pursued after taking off from Mos Eisley, the effects shot where the Star Destroyer is shooting at the Falcon was changed. The early version has different explosions and different flashes and looks less finished.\n\n\u2022 When the heroes arrive on Yavin 4, the outdoor composited shot with the matte painting of the temple is recomposited and is not synced the same. It also has an artifact in the image.\n\n\u2022 When the fighters take off from Yavin 4, there is an extra cloud and the shot is not synced the same. It also has an artifact in the image.\n\n\u2022 The scrolling end credits are completely redone with the spacing, both vertical and horizontal, altered, and a glitch in composition at the beginning has been removed.\n\n1977 Mono Audio Differences\nThe film was originally released with 35mm Dolby Stereo and 70mm 6-track audio. Since these were both mastered from the same mix stems, there is little to no difference between them in terms of content. Both feature 4 main audio channels with the 6-track having at least one LFE, channel. A mono mix was produced in June 1977 for exhibition in cinemas with no Dolby Stereo or Surround support, which did contain the following changes in content from the other versions. The majority of foreign language versions use a stereo mix with many, but not all of the mono effects alterations.\n\u2022 A different explosion sound is heard when the Tantive IV reactor is destroyed.\n\n\u2022 A different alarm sound is used as the rebel soldiers aboard the Tantive IV prepare for battle.\n\n\u2022 When R2-D2 falls over after being shot by the Jawas, the thud when he hits the ground is different.\n\n\u2022 Aunt Beru's lines are alternate takes (possibly even a different actress).\n\n\u2022 When Luke and Obi-Wan discover the wrecked sandcrawler, R2-D2 beeps.\n\n\u2022 The stormtrooper who interrogates Luke and the others as they enter Mos Eisley's lines are timed earlier.\n\n\u2022 As Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan, and the droids approach the Cantina in the mono sound version, a Cantina musical cue can be heard.\n\n\u2022 During the search of Mos Eisley for the droids, the stormtroopers lines have been changed from \"Alright, check this side of the street. The doors locked. Move on to the next one.\" to \"Alright, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next one.\"\n\n\u2022 More growls are added to Chewbacca that were not present in the stereo and surround mixes.\n\n\u2022 A short beep can be heard when the Death Star's superlaser system is booted up to fire at Alderaan.\n\n\u2022 A different, lower frequency sound effect is used for Alderaan's explosion.\n\n\u2022 When R2-D2 shows the schematics of the Death Star's tractor beam, C-3PO now speaks over the scene, the line being \"The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.\". The sound effects for the schematics being displayed have also been changed. This change was later reinstated for the 1985 video release.\n\n\u2022 The line, \"We have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23\" was changed to \"Governer Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23\", possibly read by a different voice actor.\n\n\u2022 Luke groans when he gets dragged by the Dianoga into the trash compactor's murky waters for a second time.\n\n\u2022 The pipe creaks when it is being bent by the trash compactor walls.\n\n\u2022 C-3PO's line \"Use the comlink? Oh my! I forgot, I turned it off.\" is from an alternate take.\n\n\u2022 As the stormtroopers chase Han and Chewbacca, one now says \"Close the blast doors!\" before the Rebels narrowly run through.\n\n\u2022 The line \"What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?\" spoken by Luke is from an alternate take.\n\n\u2022 The heavy echo from Luke and Leia's speech at the chasm is absent.\n\n\u2022 The blaster sound is different when Leia fires it at the stormtroopers.\n\n\u2022 Computer sounds are heard when Luke fires up the Millennium Falcon targeting system.\n\n\u2022 Lukes line, \"So, you got your reward and youre just leaving, then?\" is a different take.\n\n\u2022 The speech over the X-Wing's radios have less garble and static, and some lines are from alternate takes.\n\n\u2022 Different, louder sound effects are used for the opening of the X-Wing's s-foils.\n\n\u2022 The line \"Blast it, Biggs, where are you?\" from the original stereo sound version was changed to \"Blast it, Wedge, where are you?\" to fix continuity.\n\n\u2022 Porkins' scream when he is hit is cut out.\n\n\u2022 When Tiree's Y-wing explodes, there is an additional explosion sound. This also appears in the 6-track mix.\n\n\u2022 Sound effects for Red Leader's damaged X-wing engine were added before his crash.\n\n\u2022 The voices announcing the progress of the Death Star's journey to Yavin 4 is different.\n\n1981 Re-release\n\u2022 For the 1981 re-release, the line \"Episode IV: A NEW HOPE\" was added to the opening crawl. While this is the most noticeable alteration, the entire opening crawl was redone. A new starfield was used, one that was made and used in The Empire Strikes Back, the \"Star Wars\" title is also from The Empire Strikes Back, but it fades out before the crawl starts. The crawl was reformatted for the music to stay in synchronization and the word \"rebel\" in \"rebel spies\" is capitalized, which was not capitalized in the original 1977 crawl. The Tantive IV and Star Destroyer were recomposited with finer border, removing some prominent black lines. More subtly, the lasers and engine glows were adjusted to fit and the moons are in different positions relative to the planet.\n\n\u2022 The Empire Strikes Back\n\nThe 70mm version of the film was slightly different from the 35mm version that was more widely seen. It is understood that when the movie was considered \"finished,\" the elements were turned over to the lab and sound facilities so the desired 70mm print order could be prepared. The filmmakers, however, decided to make a few, albeit subtle, changes that, considering the expense and time involved in re-striking and and/or re-sounding 70mm prints, were reflected only in the film's 35mm prints. A couple of these differences can be found on the Ken Films Super 8 version of the film. An in-theater recording of the audio exists (made by the same person who made a recording of the 70mm showing of Star Wars) while only the first 4 minutes of video exist thanks to a CBS outlet. Some of the audio differences are likely because the in-theater records captured the discreet left and right channels where the 35mm release and subsequent home video used the matrixed Dolby Stereo track.\n70mm Visual Differences\n\u2022 After the Probot lands and moves left, there is an optical wipe to the overhead shot of Luke on his Tauntaun.\n\n\u2022 After Luke wanders through the snow and falls face down, there is an optical wipe to Han instead of a straight cut.\n\n\u2022 The bacta tank scene starts on a close-up of Two-One-Bee and pans right to a closeup of Luke in the tank. It then cuts to FX-7 extending its arm to the tank. There is no cut to Leia, Han and Threepio observing.\n\n\u2022 In the Hoth battle scene, when Luke drops into the snow after throwing a charge into the AT-AT walker, the AT-ST in the background has no atmospheric depth.\n\n\u2022 The Emperor's hologram does not fade in at the start of his conversation with Vader.*\n\n\u2022 Millennium Falcon sensor dish is not visible with Luke on weather vane. The position of the vane is also different on the background.*\n\n\u2022 The final scene begins with the first establishing shot of the rebel fleet, then cuts inside the Millennium Falcon for Lando to say, \"Luke, were ready for take-off\" (but a different take of this was used). After Luke says (voice over), \"Good luck, Lando\" the scene cuts to inside the medical bay where Luke says, \"Ill meet you at the rendezvous on Tatooine\" etc. Not in this version are two more establishing shots of the fleet and an interim effects shot over which Lando says, \"When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter we'll contact you.\".*\n\n\u2022 The atmospheric glow of the Hoth and Dagobah planets during their establishing shots is not present.\n\nFound On:\n\u2022 8mm Ken Films Print\n\n70mm Audio Differences\n\u2022 When Luke runs out of the wampa cave, there is a sound of his lightsaber deactivating even though it stays lit onscreen; this error later re-appeared in the Special Edition.\n\n\u2022 Different laser fire can be heard during the snow battle, the sound used for TIE fighters instead of X-wings.\n\n\u2022 When R2 is being loaded into Luke's X-wing, C-3PO says the word \"and\" before saying \"do take good care of yourself.\" The 2004 DVD audibly cranks up the quiet \"and\".\n\n\u2022 Yoda says the word \"Run!\" before \"Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the force.\" The following lines \"But beware the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side of the force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight\" are also much louder and clearer.\n\n\u2022 The Imperial fleet establishing shot after the scene of Luke's failure at the cave has a different TIE fighter sound effect. (Can also be heard on the foreign GOUT-tracks, SE versions have the music as originally composed for the scene)\n\n\u2022 The atmospheric reverb of Ben Kenobi's voice is mixed differently.\n\n\u2022 In Cloud City, after C-3PO says \"That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if it...\" he says \"Hello?\" twice instead of once.\n\n\u2022 While C-3PO is on Chewbaccas back when they enter the carbon freezing chamber, the line \"Now remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so dont do anything foolish\" is louder and heard more clearly.\n\n\u2022 Landos line at the end, \"Luke, were ready for takeoff.\" is a different take. (The same take can be heard in the Special Edition).\n\n\u2022 Landos line \"When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter, well contact you.\" is not present.\n\n\u2022 Landos line \"Princess, well find Han. I promise.\" is a different take.\n\n\u2022 In the final scene, there is no tracked music from \"Yoda and the Force\".\n\n35mm Mono Audio Differences\nIn addition to the differences between the 35 mm Dolby Stereo and 70 mm 6 track audio, there was also a separate mono mix that had a few changes. It was found on a 16 mm print but likely was also distributed on 35 mm prints.\n\u2022 In the asteroid field, after C-3PO says \"Oh, this is suicide\", the line \"There's nowhere to go\" was added.\n\n\u2022 Yoda lets out a frightened \"ahh!\" after Luke initially points his blaster at him.\n\n\u2022 In Cloud City, after C-3PO says \"That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if it...\" he says \"Hello?\" only once instead of twice.\n\n\u2022 While C-3PO is on Chewies back when they enter the carbon freezing chamber, the line \"Oh dear, what now?\" is added to the beginning of C-3POs dialog.\n\n\u2022 When Darth Vader falls off the carbon freeze platform he grunts instead of saying \"Argh\".\n\nAlternate Audio sources\nIn addition to the differences in the 70mm edit, There is an 8mm shorter edit of the film and the audio from The Story of The Empire Strikes Back LP that contained the following differences.\n\u2022 Luke: \"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han 'ole buddy, do you read me?\" - Different take. *, **\n\n\u2022 Luke - \"I don't pick up any life readings\" - Different take *, **\n\n\u2022 Han - \"Im coming back\" - Different take instead of the more widely heard \"Im going back\" *, **\n\n\u2022 Rogue 2: \"Captain Solo, do you copy?\" - Different take *\n\n\u2022 Leia: \"They're getting closer.\" - Different take *\n\n\u2022 Han: \"Oh, yeah? Watch this.\" - Different take *\n\n\u2022 Obi-Wans lines are not as echoed'.*\n\n\u2022 The Cloud Car Pilots have alternate dialogue - \"Any aggressive move will not be tolerated!\" \"Permission granted to land on platform 3-2-7. Any deviation from...\" \"Thank you!\"-Han cuts off comlink.*\n\n\u2022 After Lando tells Han, \"Yeah, Im responsible these days. Its the price of success.\" The 8mm continues \"And you know what, Han, you were right all along. It's over-rated.\" as C-3PO talks with the other protocol droid.*\n\n\u2022 More crowd noise as people flee Cloud City.*\n\nFound On:\n\u2022 8mm Ken Films Print\n\n\u2022 The Story of The Empire Strikes Back LP\n\n\u2022 Return of the Jedi\n\nReturn of the Jedi was left unaltered. It did feature 70mm 6 track, Dolby Stereo, and a mono mix, but there are no discernible differences. The Dolby Stereo mix was featured on all home video releases.\n\n\u2022 TV broadcasts and VHS/Betamax/CED editions\n\nThe mono mix was used for a 1980s UK ITV broadcast. There were also some minor changes made to a few 1980s pan and scanned TV broadcasts such as squeezing in the second Tusken Raider while looking through Lukes macrobinoculars.\nThe original releases of A New Hope on VHS, Betamax, and RCA's CED featured the Dolby Stereo mix, identical to that heard on the 35mm theatrical prints. Playing the mix through a home Dolby Pro-logic decoder authentically recreates the original 4-channel surround experience. This mix did not contain the line uttered by C-3PO \"The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.\" This line was only present in the original mono mix. For the 1985 VHS/laserdisc releases, Ben Burtt supervised the creation of a new, digitally remastered audio track. CBS/FOX worked with the new multi-channel mix and made a new Dolby Stereo compliant downmix for home video.\nDue to technical and cost limitations, the CED editions of A New Hope are presented time-compressed (sped up by 3%) from its original 121-minute length to 118 minutes to fit one double-sided two-hour disc.\nIn the UK and throughout Europe widescreen VHS versions of the original three films were released in 1991. An advertisement before the films started explained how widescreen showed more of the picture. They were re-released in 1994 with different artwork and released a third time as THX versions in 1995.\nThe VHS reissue in 1995, which was the last available release of the Pre-Special Edition trilogy prior to the 2006 DVD release, utilized THX digital remastering to enhance the picture and sound quality on all three films.\n\n\u2022 LaserDisc editions\n\nDue to technical limitations, most pan-and-scan versions of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are presented time-compressed (sped up by 2% for Star Wars and 4% for Empire Strikes Back) from their respective 121- and 125-minute lengths to fit one double-sided two-hour LaserDisc. Letterbox versions of the original theatrical releases of the original three films have also been released.\nThe initial 1989 North American widescreen release of A New Hope suffered from a shrinking aspect ratio. The master that was used was the Japanese subtitled LaserDisc, in which the image appeared higher on the screen to allow for subtitles. For the North American release, it was shifted down, and a black bar was put up to cover the unused parts. However, as the film progresses, the image creeps up on the screen moving underneath the top bar, causing the image to become increasingly wider. By the time the film reaches the Battle of Yavin scenes, the image has widened from 2.35:1 to 2.55:1. This problem was fixed in the 1992 reissue of the disc. The original shrinking LaserDisc has the CBS/Fox logo on it, while the fixed edition has the newer Fox Video logo on the jacket. C-3PO's line about the tractor beam can be heard on this LaserDisc and the three original 1977 effects shots can be seen.\nIn 1993, the Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection box set was released based on the interpositives struck in 1985. This version featured the original trilogy on nine CAV discs, widescreen transfers, THX remastering, audio commentary tracks, assorted bonus features, a copy of the hardcover book George Lucas: The Creative Impulse, and for A New Hope, a new surround-sound audio mix. This mix, digitally remastered by Ben Burtt and Gary Summers, was supposedly a mix of the best elements of all three original mixes. However, it is primarily a fold-down of the 6-track 70mm mix, with some mono mix elements and additional elements \"dialled in.\" An interview with Dave Schnuelle, printed in a 1993 issue of Widescreen Review magazine, corroborates these observations. Additionally, the transfer was somewhat sub-par, with scan lines often disappearing and colors being incorrectly switched.\nInitial versions of this box set were missing approximately ten seconds from The Empire Strikes Back. Fox Video offered a replacement disc, and this mistake was corrected in later pressings.\nThe final LaserDisc edition of the original trilogy was released in 1995, sourced from the 1993 masters.\n\n\u2022 1997 Star Wars Trilogy Special Editions\n\nIn 1997, Episodes IV, V, and VI were re-mastered and theatrically re-released as the \"Special Editions.\" For the re-release, in addition to extensive clean-up and restoration work, Lucas also made a number of changes to the films in order to \"finish the film the way it was meant to be\" (as Lucas said in a September 2004 interview with Associated Press).\nMany of Lucas changes for the Special Editions were cosmetic, generally adding special effects which werent originally possible. Other changes, however, are considered to have affected plot or character development. These changes, such as the change referred to by fans as \"Han shot first,\" have proven to be controversial. The \"Han shot first\" situation can be generally described as this: in the original release of Episode IV, the character Han Solo shoots and kills a bounty hunter named Greedo, after Greedo threatens to kill him in order to collect a bounty which had been placed on Solos head by Jabba the Hutt. In the Special Edition of the film, however, Greedo shoots first at close range. Only after he misses does Solo return fire. George Lucas has been quoted in Entertainment Weekly' as saying that this version of the scene was meant to be the original, as in the original storyboards (Greedo fires first at Han Solo).\n\u2022 In 2000, this version had box art redesigned to match the Box Art of Episodes I\u2013III except the front of the box was white for Episodes IV and VI while Episode V retained the black used for the Prequel box art. Also the Star Wars logos on Episodes IV\u2013VI used the logo design as featured for Episodes I\u2013III. This was done to create a more uniform look for all 6 movies.\n\nSpecial coverage on CNN in 1997 notes that Lucas spent $10 million to rework his original 1977 film, which was roughly what it cost to film it originally. $3 million of that was spent on the audio track for the special edition. Lucas also spent $2.5 million each on Episodes V and VI.\nThe following is a partial list of changes aside from overall audio and visual alterations:\n\n\u2022 A New Hope\n\n\u2022 The \"A long time ago\" card was re-created using a different font.\n\n\u2022 The opening crawl has been recomposed again using the original 1977 starfield and positions of the moons. The Tantive IV and Star Destroyer were recomposited again, using different engine glow effects.\n\n\u2022 The sunset over the canyon R2-D2 travels down has been enhanced and lengthened and the canyon scene has been darkened.\n\n\u2022 A revised Jawa sandcrawler has the sky darkened and with a few scattered stars.\n\n\u2022 The shot of the sandcrawler coming over the rise was reshot using the original model. The new shot is longer and closer with the camera panning to follow the sandcrawler.\n\n\u2022 A new digital matte painting of the sandcrawler and extended sky were added when the Jawas are setting up shop in front of the Lars farm. Artificial zooming in is also present. More vaporators have been added, but they disappear in subsequent shots.\n\n\u2022 Extended shot of the stormtroopers search for the missing droids with additional troopers riding dewbacks. A Sentinel'-class landing craft can be seen taking off, and new (costumed) stormtroopers have been added to the scene.\n\n\u2022 The Lars dinner scene has a slight audio manipulation from Aunt Beru: \"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.\" There is a slight pause before she says \"father,\" and the word \"father\" is changed to sound more worrisome.\n\n\u2022 Shots of the landspeeder in motion have been enhanced to improve the shadow and make it look further off the ground.\n\n\u2022 The long shot of Luke's landspeeder in the canyon, with the two Tusken Raiders taking aim, has been improved. Now instead of being merely a moving white \"blob,\" the landspeeder is visible in minute detail.\n\n\u2022 New CG shot of Ben Kenobis hut replaces a previous shot of the landspeeder parked near Ajim.\n\n\u2022 When Luke swings his fathers lightsaber in Bens hut, the effect has been redone.\n\n\u2022 The far shot of Mos Eisley spaceport shows a ship taking off from the ground.\n\n\u2022 Mos Eisley is bigger and busier with an extended opening showing dinosaur-like rontos and the original speeder that would have been in the first version, featuring slapstick ASP droids in front of Dash Rendars ship, the Outrider', followed by a short pause of the camera as a Jawa gets bucked from its Ronto mount. Two stormtroopers can also be seen in a far shot standing watch.\n\n\u2022 Due to color timing errors, a \"pink glow\" was apparent in many of the new Tatooine scenes, including the extended entry into Mos Eisley.\n\n\u2022 The dewback standing outside the cantina is animated and when the stormtroopers arrive one is shown dismounting from one as C-3PO says, \"I don't like the look of this.\"\n\n\u2022 A Mark IV sentry droid has been digitally added to two scenes with Imperial stormtroopers on Tatooine.\n\n\u2022 New aliens are seen in the cantina replacing the \"Wolfman\" characters in two shots, though the Defel still appears in the cantina. Although these new characters look different from each other, they are actually both portrayed by the same mask. The mask was just turned around backwards for the second creature.\n\n\u2022 Hans last line to Greedo, \"Yes, Ill bet you have,\" was edited to a calmer \"I'll bet you have.\"\n\n\u2022 Greedo now fires an inaccurately aimed shot at Han before being shot in the cantina while Han bobs his head slightly to \"dodge\" the shot. (This change caused a great uproar in the community, and thousands of fans complained.)\n\n\u2022 A CGI version of Jabba the Hutt confronts Han Solo in the Millennium Falcon launch bay, replacing a Human actor from a deleted scene that is now re-inserted after the Greedo scene. New dialogue was recorded in the Huttese language for this scene. Also, Boba Fett has been added to the scene as a bystander and in one scene a close-up.\n\n\u2022 A new Mos Eisley scene of the Falcon taking off with troopers firing upon it. The angle of the Falcon flying off has also been adjusted.\n\n\u2022 Large Praxis-effect shockwaves from the destruction of Alderaan and the Death Star have been added, and Alderaan's explosion itself redone.\n\n\u2022 The Death Star docking bay is revised to be more consistent with the one seen in Return of the Jedi, most notably in the overhead shot when the Millennium Falcon has landed.\n\n\u2022 The flashes of blaster impacts on the Imperial officers' chests were censored in all but one shot\n\n\u2022 C-3POs line where he describes the tractor beams power systems is put back in.\n\n\u2022 When Han Solo and Chewbacca are chasing a squad of stormtroopers on the Death Star, instead of running to a dead end with more stormtroopers, the pair end up at a hangar bay with seemingly hundreds of stormtroopers and officers. Laser fire was increased in the next scene where Chewbacca approaches the corner.\n\n\u2022 \"Close the blast doors!\" is put back into the scene where Han and Chewbacca jump through the doors as they close.\n\n\u2022 A digital version of a shot of the Millennium Falcon flying below the planet Yavin towards Yavin 4.\n\n\u2022 A scene between Luke Skywalker and Biggs Darklighter, just before the Battle of Yavin. A pilot has been digitally inserted walking past the camera at one point to mask a deleted line by Red Leader (which in the script indicated that he knew Luke's father and his reputation as a pilot).\n\n\u2022 New CGI shots of the X-wings and Y-wings taking off from Yavin 4 (in the original version, they just appeared as white dots) and assembling in front of the Death Star.\n\n\u2022 New, additional, and revised dogfighting and attack run scenes during the battle with the Death Star.\n\n\u2022 After Red Leaders unsuccessful trench run, the line \"Hes on your tail!\" was added to the film.\n\n\u2022 The shot of the Rebel fighters flying to the Death Star and away from the Death Star has been revised.\n\n\u2022 Some garbage matte boxes around starships in space were removed (while others still remained).\n\n\u2022 Several explosions were recomposited to remove black borders and other artifacts.\n\n\u2022 When the Death Star explodes, a new digital shockwave was added.\n\n\u2022 During the victory celebration, as Luke, Han and Chewbacca enter the assembly hall, Rebel soldiers standing on the sides were a matte painting in the original; they have now been replaced with actors composited in.\n\n\u2022 James Earl Jones was added to the credits as the voice of Darth Vader.\n\n\u2022 \"Luke's Theme\" is partially repeated in the ending credits music to allow time for the added Special Edition release credits.\n\n\u2022 In addition, most of the wipes were optically recomposited to improve quality.\n\n\u2022 The Empire Strikes Back\n\n\u2022 New scenes on Hoth with a fiercer-looking wampa ice creature (man in a suit), including showing the wampa screeching in agony following the loss of its limb. Two close-up shots of the original wampa mask are still noticeable.\n\n\u2022 Luke's line \"This is it.\" is no longer muted. This was likely a mistake present in the theatrical cut as Luke could be seen mouthing the words.\n\n\u2022 Most of the opening battle sequence was recomposited digitally to reduce (but not eliminate) transparency issues.\n\n\u2022 An additional CGI shot of the Slave I pursuing the Millennium Falcon out of the Star Destroyer's floating garbage has been added.\n\n\u2022 R2 whistles twice after Luke crashes into the swamp and before the huge shot of it with the Bogwing instead of once.\n\n\u2022 Lukes line, \"Youre lucky you don't taste very good,\" after R2-D2 is spit out by a Dragonsnake, is changed to \"You were lucky to get out of there.\"\n\n\u2022 Vader's breathing in the cave scene is at a lower pitch.\n\n\u2022 New and additional shots of Cloud City with a CGI Falcon and Cloud Cars approaching and flying through.\n\n\u2022 Background cityscapes have been replaced in some areas with new CGI versions.\n\nCloud City.]]\n\u2022 New sequence added following a Cloud Car patrolling Cloud City.\n\n\u2022 A few wall panels have been digitally replaced with windows on Cloud City.\n\n\u2022 In the scene where Luke heads to Cloud City, the Cloud Car is replaced by a Tibanna refinery.\n\n\u2022 Lando Calrissian says \"Attention\" twice when he speaks on the Cloud City PA.\n\n\u2022 Shot of Tian Chyler, a Bespin Wing Guard, and an unidentified blonde woman listening to Lando on the Cloud City PA ordering the evacuation of the city are added. Exterior shot of people milling about in Downtown Plaza.\n\n\u2022 Luke screams as he jumps off the platform in Cloud City (the scream is actually lifted from the Emperor's death scream from Return of the Jedi).\n\n\u2022 Darth Vaders line \"Bring my shuttle.\" is changed to \"Alert my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival.\" The rest of the scene is extended with an additional shot of Vader walking to his shuttle and arriving on his Star Destroyer, where an outtake from Return of the Jedi was used (thats Moff Jerjerrod with his lines muted out who greets Vader).\n\n\u2022 A digital hatch has been added to replace the white light that appears when Lando opens the outer hatch of the Falcon to rescue Luke.\n\n\u2022 Some garbage matte boxes around starships were removed (but not all).\n\n\u2022 \"The Imperial March\" is partially repeated in the ending credits music to make room for the Special Edition release credits.\n\n\u2022 James Earl Jones was added to the credits as the voice of Darth Vader.\n\n\u2022 Return of the Jedi\n\nsinging \"Jedi Rocks\" in the 1997 Special Edition of Return of the Jedi.]]\n\u2022 A new Max Rebo Band musical number, \"Jedi Rocks\" replaces \"Lapti Nek\"; Oola is now accompanied by three back-up dancers. Some other footage is added from the extended music video of Lapti Nek.\n\n\u2022 A new shot of Oola was added showing her getting up inside the rancor's den and screaming.\n\n\u2022 Boba Fett is briefly shown flirting with Ryst\u00e1ll Sant at Jabba's palace, and walking past Jabba.\n\n\u2022 Added shot on Tatooine of a herd of repeated live-action Banthas before heading to the Pit of Carkoon.\n\n\u2022 Right after the scene of the Banthas, the poorly composited guard walking about on the Sail Barge's deck was redone.\n\n\u2022 A revised version of the Sarlacc at the base of the Pit of Carkoon which features a beaked tongue and extra tentacles.\n\n\u2022 When the skiff Han and Chewbacca are on is shot at from Jabba's barge, it now rocks to the side and forward rather than its original forward tilt.\n\n\u2022 Some CGI ropes have been added around Han's ankles as he hangs onto the skiff by his feet.\n\n\u2022 In the original version, where Han is about to shoot the tentacle that is grabbing Lando, Han says \"Its all right, trust me!\" In the Special Edition, Han says \"Its all right, I can see a lot better!\"\n\n\u2022 In the original version, a flight of four TIE fighters appear from behind the camera flying towards the Death Star and disappear a second before the scene changes to the Emperor's arrival. This is corrected and the fighters continue heading toward the Death Star.\n\n\u2022 In the original version, as the Ewoks commence their counterattack, two Ewoks play each of the first two melody lines of Aaron Coplands \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" on their horns. In subsequent releases, what the second Ewok is playing is replaced by the first melody line of \"Fanfare...\" a whole step down from the other, as heard later at the movie right before Luke makes a funeral pyre for his fathers armor. It is not known whether this change was meant to avoid copyright issues, and Copland died before the 1997 Special Edition was made.\n\n\u2022 As with the destruction of the first Death Star, the second has been given a shockwave ring.\n\n\u2022 At the end of the trilogy after the Empire is defeated, in addition to Endor, scenes of celebration on Bespin, Tatooine, and Coruscant are shown. In the Coruscant scene, a stormtrooper can be seen being \"crowd-surfed\" against his will and uttering the infamous Wilhelm scream. The \"Ewok Celebration\" song (often referred to as \"Yub Nub\") during this sequence has been replaced with an entirely new John Williams composition, \"Victory Celebration.\"\n\n\u2022 The idea of this concept was discussed during the actual pre-production of Return of the Jedi.Star Wars in 100 Scenes\n\n\u2022 A few quick shots of the Ewoks celebrating by campfires and with different musical instruments (horns) have been added.\n\n\u2022 During the end celebration, a brief shot of Luke hugging Wedge Antilles was inserted.\n\n\u2022 The Force ghost scene has been edited. In the original version, there is a medium shot of the ghosts of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda, cut to a shot of Luke rejoining his friends, and then another long shot of Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda. In the Special Edition, the medium shot is split in two by the shot of Luke rejoining his friends. After the medium shot, there is another cut to Luke, and then a cut to the long shot of the ghosts.\n\n\u2022 \"Parade of the Ewoks\" is repeated in the ending credits music to make room for the new Special Edition release credits.\n\n\u2022 2004 Star Wars Trilogy DVD\n\nIn 2004, in addition to an extensive and comprehensive hi-definition digital cleanup and restoration job by Lowry Digital, the original trilogy films were changed once again for their release on DVD. In these new versions of the films, a few changes which had been made for the 1997 Special Editions were removed. Even more changes were made to the films, however. With this release, Lucasfilm created a new high-definition master of the films, which will be used in future releases as well. Its sound mix was a combination of the first SE mix and the original mono mix.\nOne of the most notable of these new changes includes new footage shot during the filming of Revenge of the Sith of Ian McDiarmid portraying Palpatine, which has been inserted into The Empire Strikes Back, replacing the original performance (voiced by actor Clive Revill and portrayed by Marjorie Eaton, wearing a specially made mask) recorded for the film. Another notable and quite controversial change was to a scene at the end of Episode VI, when the spirits of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker look upon the Rebels' celebration. The original actor who played Anakin in this scene (Sebastian Shaw) was replaced by Hayden Christensen, the actor who played Anakin in Episodes II and III.\nIn 2005, the 2004 Special Editions were again released on DVD; however, this time they were repackaged and sold as a three-disc set that did not include the bonus materials disc. This was done to provide a more affordable trilogy set.\nThe 2004 DVD changes were made in an attempt to make a better connection between the old and new trilogies. The 2004 DVD releases also received John D. Lowry's digital restoration visual enhancement treatment. The following is a partial\nlist of changes:\n\n\u2022 All films\n\n\u2022 The \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\" card in the opening crawl has been replaced with the card from Attack of the Clones.\n\n\u2022 A New Hope\n\n\u2022 Darth Vader's voice filter was changed to match the rest of the saga.\n\n\u2022 A buzz is now heard when R2-D2 opens the escape pod aboard Tantive IV.\n\n\u2022 When the Jawa Sandcrawler stops outside the Lars Homestead, C-3PO says \"We've stopped\" before telling R2-D2 to wake up. He also says \"Wake up!\" an additional time.\n\n\u2022 Obi-Wan Kenobis scream to scare off the Sand People has been changed to a higher-pitched wail. The new version of Kenobis scream in the 2004 version sounds similar to a krayt dragon (first seen in Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided). This is similar to the sound that Boga on Utapau in Revenge of the Sith makes. Previously the sound had a dewback roar tacked onto the end.\n\n\u2022 A brief shot of Luke's landspeeder as it enters Mos Eisley carrying Luke, Ben Kenobi, and the droids has been redone.\n\n\u2022 The odd \"pink glow\" is removed from the extended Mos Eisley entrance sequence (which includes what is described in the precedent entry).\n\n\u2022 The Han/Greedo scene is redone yet again, so that Greedo and Han shoot at almost exactly the same moment, but Greedo is still fractionally ahead. Han also dodges Greedos shot by moving to his right in the new version in a slightly more lifelike manner. In addition, Hans original \"Yes, I'll bet you have\" line was restored, but was moved to a few frames earlier.\n\n\u2022 After Han shoots Greedo, a frying sizzle can be heard.\n\n\u2022 An improved CGI version of Jabba the Hutt now confronts Han Solo in the scene added to the 1997 re-release. This new version more closely resembles the way Jabba looked in Episode I.\n\n\u2022 During the dialogue between Tarkin and Leia, their voices change modulation noticeably mid-sentence, and Leia's lines exhibit background hiss whenever she speaks.\n\n\u2022 When Luke trains with his lightsaber on the Falcon, several shots are very green. The others remain very pale like they were originally.\n\n\u2022 The line \"Theres no one here\" has been added as the stormtroopers are searching the Falcon'.\n\n\u2022 When the docking bay controller tries to contact TK-421, slightly audible static can be heard over the communicator.\n\n\u2022 The detail on Vader's chest has been digitally rotoscoped in one shot for unknown reasons.\n\n\u2022 The matte painting in the detention block has been extended, making the corridor seem longer. The painting's perspective has been edited to make it appear more realistic.\n\n\u2022 The dianoga's eye stalk that pops up over the water to spy on the heroes has been modified so that it blinks.\n\n\u2022 The English lettering in the Death Star tractor beam control panel (\"POWER - TRACTOR BEAM 12 (SEC. N6)\" and \"INOPERATIVE\") is changed to Aurebesh lettering. The word \"INOPERATIVE\" is truncated out of the full-screen DVD version.\n\n\u2022 An audible bump was added to the infamous gaffe where the stormtrooper on the screen-right bumps his head on the door-frame when they break into the control room. This mistake was alluded to in Episode II when Jango Fett, escaping from Obi-Wan on Kamino, bangs his helmet on the closing door of the Slave I.\n\n\u2022 Luke and Leia's voice echo when they are trapped in the Death Star chasm has been redone more realistically.\n\n\u2022 There are also several lightsaber mistakes visible in the battle between Obi-Wan and Vader, such as their lightsabers changing color, and Obi-Wan's missing its core, plus a few far shots still show uncolored lightsabers.\n\n\u2022 As the blast door closes after Luke blasts the controls, Darth Vader's lightsaber glow was added.\n\n\u2022 John Williams' score has been quieted or eliminated from some portions of the Battle of Yavin scene, such as \"The Force Theme\" when the X-wings make their first attack run which is now drowned out by the loud engines (except on the French audio track).\n\n\u2022 One line in the Biggs reunion scene (\"How dyou get here?\") is no longer cut mid-sentence. This was likely a mistake in the 1997 Special Edition.\n\n\u2022 The \"He's on your tail!\" that was added for the 1997 Special Edition was removed.\n\n\u2022 The shot of the Y-wings descending to make the first attack run has been fixed. Originally, the two lead Y-wings disappeared too early, and only the third Y-wing exited the frame properly. Now all three move smoothly out of frame.\n\n\u2022 The credits are unchanged from the 1997 Special Edition, except that the format was changed to make it more in line with the credits roll of the prequel trilogy.\n\n\u2022 The left and right surround channels of the score have been swapped. 20th Century Fox claims these and other audio changes are \"deliberate creative decisions\" and not mistakes.\n\n\u2022 Due to color timing issue, the entire movie has a magenta tint, especially noticeable in skin tones and explosions. Several segments show heavier color correction, especially the early shots of C-3PO and R2-D2 on the blockade runner. the entire film is oversaturated with many of the reds, greens, and blues nearly glowing, in particular, R2-D2 and R5-D4. The explosions recomposed for the 1997 theatrical release are all muted instead of bright.\n\n\u2022 The Empire Strikes Back\n\n\u2022 The wording in the opening credits has subtle transparency errors.\n\n\u2022 Due to color timing issues, the explosion accompanying the destruction of the shield generator appears with a strange tint of green and purple.\n\n\u2022 At least one shot of R2-D2 in space has been modified with CGI recoloring to make him have blue panels instead of black (the blue screen technique in the original film removed all color from the droid). With the new coloring, his black central \"eye\" appears much smaller than normal. Despite this fix, R2-D2's domes appear black in several other shots throughout this release of the trilogy.\n\n\u2022 In the original and special edition, when Darth Vader asks if the Falcon hyperdrive is deactivated, Admiral Pietts rank plaque and code cylinders are on the wrong side of his uniform (the plaque is supposed to be on the left side of his tunic, but it was on his right side). This is corrected and Piett has the correct rank placement on his uniform. The same was done for another officer in the same shot.\n\n\u2022 Due to color timing issues, Yoda appears much more green than in previous versions.\n\n\u2022 In a scene where Darth Vader speaks to the Emperor via hologram, the Emperor is now Palpatine as portrayed by Ian McDiarmid (in the original film and the Special Edition, Marjorie Eaton, wearing a specially made mask with chimpanzee's eyes superimposed over her own portrayed the Emperor, whose voice was dubbed in by Clive Revill.) A few lines of new dialogue have been added to this scene as well, in which Palpatine informs Vader that their new enemy is \"the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.\"\n\n\u2022 The four lines spoken by Boba Fett (Originally in the voice of Jason Wingreen) are now in the voice of Temuera Morrison, the actor who played Jango Fett (Boba Fetts clone \"father\"). The engine sounds of his ship, Slave I, have also been modified to sound as they did in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones'.\n\n\u2022 The odd \"pink glow\" on the scene where the Cloud Car is replaced by the Tibanna refinery in the Special Edition version is removed.\n\n\u2022 In both the original and Special Edition versions of the film, during the scene in which Han is lowered into the carbon-freezing chamber, a shadow on the actor's clothing has given rise to a rumored (but false) wardrobe blooper of him wearing his dark jacket during one shot (behind the scenes shots of the scene dispel the rumor). The \"jacket\" has been digitally erased in this release.\n\n\u2022 Due to color timing issues, Darth Vader's lightsaber in the Luke/Vader duel now looks pink instead of red in almost all the shots it is in (this problem is also in the Episode VI lightsaber duel as well). It also changes to orange in a few shots (when Vader leaps at Luke in their duel in the Carbon freezing chamber, and when they encounter in the cave on Dagobah).\n\n\u2022 The tracked Emperor death scream by Luke Skywalker introduced in the Special Edition re-release, which is heard during Luke's voluntary fall from the Cloud City platform after his fight with Vader, was removed.\n\n\u2022 The credits are unchanged from the 1997 Special Edition. Consequently, Clive Revill remains credited as the voice of the Emperor, despite being replaced by McDiarmid, who remains uncredited.\n\n\u2022 Return of the Jedi\n\n\u2022 The matte lines on the rancor have been completely erased and the blue screen glow on the figure of Luke has been removed, with the colors being retimed to match, making the two appear to be in the same scene together.\n\n\u2022 The effects of the scene from the interior of the Imperial shuttle have been again improved, as to further decrease the transparency, which caused the Forest Moon of Endor to be seen through the cockpit in earlier releases.\n\n\u2022 At the beginning of the duel between Luke and Vader, in the scene where their sabers clash in front of the Emperors face, the scene has been noticeably darkened. The lowered brightness hides the \"Emperors slugs\" gaffe (dark colored blobs on the actors hood to cover gaps in the makeup). This darkening makes the lightsabers appear to intersect, and makes it appear that Vaders saber is in front of Luke's, suggesting that he was trying to kill his master rather than defend him (this is of course an unintended consequence of the gaffe).\n\n\u2022 Vader's lightsaber appears pink or red-violet in several scenes, then changes back to the normal red (compare the shot where he is searching for Luke who is hiding, versus most of their fight prior).\n\n\u2022 In Anakin Skywalkers final scene, when he is not wearing his helmet, the eyebrows of actor Sebastian Shaw have been digitally removed. This is meant to indicate what happens to Anakins eyebrows when he gets burned alive on Mustafar after the duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. His eyes have also been changed to blue, to better resemble the Anakin portrayed by Hayden Christensen in the prequel trilogy. His skin tone has also been altered so it appears gray and colorless, instead of fleshy and pale like it was previously (also compare to his exposed head in Empire Strikes Back).\n\n\u2022 Another scene of celebration, this one on Naboo, is shown after the Empire is defeated, some Gungans partake in the celebration, and one is heard chanting \"Wesa free!\", Some Star Wars fans believe that this is Jar Jar Binks even though it is not Jar Jar's voice.\n\n\u2022 In the Coruscant celebration scene, the Galactic Senate building can be seen in the distance at the start of the shot, and the Jedi Temple can be seen at the end. These replaced generic buildings that appeared in the 1997 Special Edition. This is meant to indicate that the Jedi Temple was not destroyed during the Great Jedi Purge.\n\n(left) as the spirit of Anakin Skywalker.]]\n\u2022 In the final scene where the spirits of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda appear to Luke, the Sebastian Shaw (as Anakin) has been replaced by Hayden Christensen. Only the head was replaced, but the rest of Anakins body has been digitally altered to look more like Hayden Christensen, however, the details that show through from the background are identical in every respect revealing that only Haydens head was used while it is still Sebastian Shaw's body. Lucas has said that the reason he made this change was because after redemption, Anakin returned to his \"inner persona,\" once one with the Force, and appeared the way he was before he turned to the dark side of the Force.\n\n(left) as the ghost of Anakin Skywalker.]]\n\u2022 Note that in all three films, the ending credits have remained unchanged from the Special Edition releases in 1997. Thus, they do not reflect such changes as Ian McDiarmids Emperor in The Empire Strikes Back or Hayden Christensens Anakin in Return of the Jedi.\n\n\u2022 2006 DVD release\n\nOn September 12, 2006, the original trilogy was re-released on DVD for a limited time (until December 31, 2006). Each film (Episodes IV, V, and VI) is packaged as a two-disc set with the first disc presenting the 2004 Special Edition with remastered THX sound and picture and the second disc containing the \"original, unaltered theatrical release\" of each film as \"bonus material\".\nThese original editions are presented as they were first shown theatrically. For example, Star Wars has the 1977 opening scroll (before \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" was added and other adjustments made for the April 10, 1981 re-issue). Though the original features are presented in Dolby 2.0 Surround audio, the video transfer is derived not from original masters, but from the 1993 Laserdisc transfer (aside from the original Episode IV opening scroll taken from a best available original 1977 print), meaning that the films 2.39:1 Panavision format is letterboxed into a non-anamorphic 4:3 video frame, even for widescreen television playback.\nInstead of using the original theatrical sound mixes, the \"bonus\" DVD presentations use the 1993 laserdisc remixes. However, the Spanish and French audio tracks on the Star Wars DVD appear to be based on the original theatrical mono sound mix for the film, not the Definitive Collection version. Certain sound effects from the 1993 mix are missing (such as all of the \"exploding glass\" sounds when Luke and Han blast the various cameras and such in the Death Stars detention center), and certain sounds have been added (such as metallic clicks when R2-D2 and Chewbacca press buttons on the Millennium Falcon holographic chessboard). Luke Skywalker also says \"Blast it, Wedge, where are you?\" during the final battle on the alternate language tracks, something he only said in the theatrical mono mix. In all other versions of the film, he says, \"Blast it, Biggs, where are you?\"\nThe French and Spanish audio tracks for The Empire Strikes Back 2006 DVD also feature a different sound mix than the 1993 Definitive Collection mix. This alternate mix features additional sounds that were not heard on the 35mm and subsequent home video versions, but which were later reincorporated into the 1997 and 2004 mixes. Such sounds include additional R2-D2 beeps when Yoda rummages through Lukes supplies, which are missing from prior mixes, and additional TIE Fighter engine sounds in the establishing shot of Darth Vaders Star Destroyer (after Luke Skywalker beheads the illusory Vader on Dagobah), which are missing from the prior sound mixes.\n\n\u2022 2011 Blu-ray release\n\nIn 2004, Lucasfilm's then-Vice President of Marketing Jim Ward speculated on future releases: \"As the technology evolves and we get into a high-definition platform that is easily consumable by our customers, the situation is much better, but there will always be work to be done.\"\nAt Celebration V on August 14, 2010, a version of all six films released on the Blu-ray high-definition format was announced. It was said to include never-before-seen and otherwise unreleased deleted scenes from the original trilogy, although the set did not include the original editions.\nIn late August 2011, more details on the releases' changes were made available.\n\n\u2022 A New Hope\n\n\u2022 A rock was added in front of R2-D2 while he's hiding from the Tusken Raiders after they attack Luke. This confused many fans, as the hole he peeked out of was smaller than R2 himself.\n\n\u2022 Obi-Wan Kenobi's Krayt Dragon call was changed.\n\n\u2022 A subtle beep can be heard from R2 before Obi-Wan looks over at him.\n\n\u2022 Some frames have been removed during Han and Greedo's shootout.\n\n\u2022 Blue hue during Death Star's explosion has been removed.\n\n\u2022 During Lukes lightsaber training inside the Millennium Falcon', the green lightsaber effect was corrected to blue, but only the one shot was fixed, leaving the rest of the lightsaber effects in their original state.\n\n\u2022 Some lines are from alternate takes.\n\n\u2022 Matte boxes that occasionally surround the TIE fighters were removed.\n\n\u2022 Missing portion of the frame that occurs during the TIE fighter attack on the Millennium Falcon was restored.\n\n\u2022 Additional sound effects are added, and some are altered.\n\n\u2022 Many of the audio changes made for the 1977 mono version were incorporated, with the exception of Beru's lines.\n\n\u2022 The Empire Strikes Back\n\n\u2022 Digitally removed puppeteering flaw of rig visible on Wampa arm attacking Luke.\n\n\u2022 A reflection has been added to a window in Cloud City when a cloud car passes by.\n\n\u2022 Sparks have been added to the melting chamber when Chewbacca is searching for the remains of C-3PO in Cloud City.\n\n\u2022 Return of the Jedi\n\n\u2022 The door of Jabbas Palace was edited to appear larger.\n\n\u2022 There are brighter beams of light when Han is released from the carbonite.\n\n\u2022 A CGI Dug was added to Jabba's Palace.\n\n\u2022 CGI eyelids were added to some Ewoks.\n\n\u2022 When R2-D2 is shot, some additional effects have been added, revealing his many hidden tools. In the same scene, an exposed cable from the production equipment laying across the ground was removed.\n\n\u2022 Most of the lightsaber shots were restored by giving them back their white cores. Most notably during the shot where Vader and Luke cross blades in front of the Emperor.\n\n\u2022 The \"Emperor slugs\" have been removed when the restoration team was working on the lightsabers of that shot.\n\n\u2022 Vader screams \"NO!\" in anger before he tosses the Emperor down the hole.\n\n\u2022 2015 Digital Movie Collection\n\n\u2022 The 20th Century Fox Fanfare was removed from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The ending of the track \"The Rebel Fleet/End Title\" from The Empire Strikes Back now plays over the Lucasfilm logo. A New Hope retained the fanfare, as 20th Century Fox owned permanent distribution rights to the film until the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney in 2019.\n\n\u2022 2019 Disney+ 4K restoration\n\nCoinciding with the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019, previously unannounced 4K versions of all films were released to the service. The restorations began in 2010 when George Lucas intended to restore the films for a 3D release, but the plans were shelved after Disney purchased Lucasfilm in 2012. The new restorations correct many of the digital video noise reduction (DVNR) and color correction issues that plagued the DVD and Blu-ray releases. Beyond those fixes, most of the changes from previous releases are left intact. These restorations were later released on 4K Blu-ray as part of the Skywalker Saga box set on April 10, 2020.\n\n\u2022 All films\n\n\u2022 The 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare have been restored for The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, due to the Disney-Fox merger earlier that year. For these versions as well as A New Hope, the 1994 logo is used minus the News Corporation byline. The 1997 Lucasfilm logo has also been replaced by the 2015 logo.\n\n\u2022 After having been replaced in the 2004 DVD release with the card from Attack of the Clones, the original \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...\" card before the opening crawl has been restored (A New Hope is the 1997 recreation).\n\n\u2022 The aspect ratio has been changed slightly from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1.\n\n\u2022 A New Hope\n\n\u2022 Various shots throughout the film were recomposited or had effects slightly altered to appear properly in 4K.\n\n\u2022 When R2-D2 and C-3PO part company in the desert, the clouds in the final long shot over C-3PO have been changed again.\n\n\u2022 The color of the sky when Luke looks out at the Tatooine suns was redone. It now appears more solidly pink as opposed to pink and blue like in the 2004 version.\n\n\u2022 A mistake from the 1997 version showing a transparent Luke visible in a doorway in the Lars homestead was removed.\n\n\u2022 A fly which landed on the camera lens during a shot of Owen in the Lars homestead was digitally removed from the picture.\n\n\u2022 The shadows cast on R2-D2 by the rocks added in the 2011 Blu-ray release were redone to give a greater sense of depth.\n\n\u2022 The shot of the CG landspeeder entering Mos Eisley was slightly altered to position the landspeeder more to the right.\n\n\u2022 A new edit to the Han/Greedo confrontation has a new shot of Greedo saying \"ma klounkee,\" which roughly translates to \"Ill end you\" (based on what Sebulba said to Anakin in The Phantom Menace during their first confrontation), just before he and Han fire at each other (which is now one shot towards each other at the same time). The shot of Greedo exploding has also been altered by removing the Greedo dummy and cutting earlier to the explosion cloud to give the impression that the explosion shot happened at the same angle Han and Greedo fired at each other. Disney stated that the change was done at the behest of George Lucas before the restoration was shelved following Disneys purchase of Lucasfilm.\n\n\u2022 The laser bolt fired by the training remote on board the Millennium Falcon has its color restored to red.\n\n\u2022 Lukes lightsaber color during his training scene aboard the Millennium Falcon' has been fully corrected to blue.\n\n\u2022 Various lightsaber effects were re-done for the Vader vs. Obi-Wan duel in order to fix color errors and missing glows.\n\n\u2022 Some visual fixes during the Battle of Yavin that were made in the 2004 release were not replicated for the 2019 4K version, including missing Y-wings and Y-wings suddenly disappearing out of frame.\n\n\u2022 The Empire Strikes Back\n\n\u2022 Various shots throughout the film were recomposited or had effects slightly altered to appear properly in 4K.\n\n\u2022 The close-up shot of the Wampa's arm swiping at Luke was slightly re-framed in order to better hide the edge of the puppeted arm.\n\n\u2022 The wipe from Leia and General Rieekan speaking in Echo Base to the Imperial fleet in space was redone.\n\n\u2022 The shield generator explosion was redone in order to hide the color timing error made in the 2004 version.\n\n\u2022 Shots of the interior of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were slightly cropped to appear tighter.\n\n\u2022 Luke and Vader's lightsaber colors during their duel in the Dagobah cave were redone to appear paler.\n\n\u2022 The window that Leia looks out in the Cloud City apartment was slightly touched up again.\n\n\u2022 The new smoke and sparks added to the Cloud City furnace in the 2011 Blu-ray release were touched up.\n\n\u2022 New artificial lighting was added to Han's CGI shoulders (added in the 2004 DVD release) before he is put into the carbon chamber.\n\n\u2022 Return of the Jedi\n\n\u2022 Various shots throughout the film were recomposited or had effects altered to appear properly in 4K.\n\n\u2022 A hole was filled in the transition between the live action element and the matte painting in the scene where Vader lands on Endor.\n\n\u2022 During the Luke vs. Vader duel just before Vader stumbles, a prop being manipulated by one of the production cue was briefly raised into the shot on the lower right. This has been digitally removed.\n\n\u2022 In the scene where Wedge races out of the reactor core towards the camera just after disabling the power regulator, the color of the explosion was visible within the engine intakes likely due to blue screen error. This has been digitally removed.\n\n\u2022 Changes to the Prequel Trilogy\n\n\u2022 2001 Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace DVD\n\nSeveral scenes are added or removed from the film:\n\u2022 Sebulba's introduction has two new scenes, the shot of the crowd cheering him is slightly shorter as well.\n\n\u2022 The introductions to some other racers are included.\n\n\u2022 Anakin now promises to Shmi that he'll be safe.\n\n\u2022 More shots of the pods starting up have been added.\n\n\u2022 Footage of the second lap in the Pod Race was reinserted.\n\n\u2022 A scene of Watto screaming \"SEBULBA!\" is removed.\n\n\u2022 An air taxi sequence was reinserted after the arrival on Coruscant.\n\n\u2022 The shot of 500 Republica's base has been removed.\n\n\u2022 2002 Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones DVD\n\nMost of these changes did not appear in the main theatrical release, but made it into a version shown in select digital theaters.\n\u2022 Several speeders were removed from a shot during the Bounty Hunter pursuit scene.\n\n\u2022 New dialogue added to the scene where Anakin confesses to the Tusken slaughter to Padm\u00e9.\n\n\u2022 Additional sparks and smoke have been added to Jango Fett's jetpack shortly before his death to better present its malfunction.\n\n\u2022 After falling out of the gunship on Geonosis, a clone trooper asks if Padm\u00e9 is alright. Her alert, somewhat offended-sounding response of \"yes\" has been changed to a more realistic groggy \"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\u2022 Anakins mechanical hand now holds Padm\u00e9s hand during the closing wedding sequence.\n\n\u2022 During their duel on Kamino a shot of Jango Fett headbutting Obi-Wan is removed from the UK and Irish version of the film.\n\n\u2022 2005 Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD\n\nDespite Lucasfilm's official statement that there were absolutely no changes made to the theatrical version of the film, the November 1, 2005 DVD release of Revenge of the Sith had a few slight changes from the theatrical cut.\n\u2022 In the scene where a shot transitions to Vader crawling up the lava bank, a wipe from the shot of Obi-Wan and Threepio in the cockpit of Padm\u00e9s ship leaving Mustafar to Vaders mechanical hand grasping at the volcanic soil has been replaced with a straight cut to this shot from the cockpit of Padm\u00e9's ship on the DVD.\n\n\u2022 Vader's \"NOOO!\" has been slightly shortened.\n\n\u2022 2011 Blu-ray release\n\nFor the Blu-ray and future 3-D release, The Phantom Menace went through an extensive restoration using the original digital files (although shot on film, a digital version of the movie was created back in 1999 for a short release in four theaters with digital projection). This restoration provides a clearer picture with no image magnification or artifacts, flaws which are present on the DVD release.\n\n\u2022 The Phantom Menace\n\n\u2022 The scene composition affected by image magnification in the original DVD release was restored bringing around 8% more picture to the frame.\n\n\u2022 Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi's Force speed effect was redone to look more realistic.\n\n\u2022 A close-up shot of Nute Gunray and Rune Haako watching a viewscreen showing the Jedi escaping was replaced for a wide shot with a new effect for the screen itself.\n\n\u2022 The puppet version of Yoda was replaced with a CGI version as in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.\n\n\u2022 An effects error causing Fode and Beed's hand to pass through their vest was fixed.\n\n\u2022 Right after Jabba the Hutt's introduction before the podrace a new voice is heard from a spectator when the camera is focused on the crowd.\n\n\u2022 Calls from the Senate to \"Vote now!\" when Queen Amidala puts forward a motion of no confidence have been replaced with the sound of a general uproar.\n\n\u2022 On Coruscant at night, on the landing platform, when Jar Jar proclaims \"Weesa Going Home!\" Anakin says \"Come on Artoo\". R2-D2's beeped reply, heard in previous versions, is absent and he does not reply.\n\n\u2022 Attack of the Clones\n\n\u2022 During the chase on Coruscant, when Anakin and Obi-Wan pass through the power couplings, several shots are rearranged.\n\n\u2022 During Anakin's nightmare scene, a voice-over of Shmi crying out his name is added.\n\n\u2022 After Yoda saves Obi-Wan and Anakin from Dooku's falling pillar, the reaction shots of Yoda and then Anakin and Obi-Wan are moved to before the shots of Dooku escaping on his ship and Padm\u00e9 and the Clone-troopers arriving and firing at him. This edit creates an irregularity in the background music.\n\n\u2022 Revenge of the Sith\n\n\u2022 The scene in which Obi-Wan encounters General Grievous on Utapau and the Clone Army arrives is altered, adding new dialogue from the troopers as they land on the platform.\n\n\u2022 The Kashyyyk headquarters rooftop was rendered to appear more significantly aged by adding moss and rust.\n\n\u2022 The transition from Padm\u00e9s ship to Vaders hand on Mustafar is changed from a straight cut back to a wipe, restoring the original theatrical release.\n\n\u2022 3-D releases\n\nAt a ShoWest convention in 2005, George Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he was planning to release all six films in 3D. The Phantom Menace was released in 3-D on Februrary 10, 2012, based on the 2011 Blu-Ray master. The only confirmed change was the sharpening of a magnetic wand during the podracing scene. Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith were originally set for release in September and October 2013 respectively, but were postponed following Disney's buyout of Lucasfilm.\n\n\u2022 2015 Digital Movie Collection\n\n\u2022 The 20th Century Fox Fanfare was removed from all three prequel films. The ending of the track \"The Rebel Fleet/End Title\" from The Empire Strikes Back now plays over the Lucasfilm logo.\n\n\u2022 2019 Disney+ 4K restoration\n\nAlong with the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy was remastered in 4K for Disney+ upon the services launch on November 12, 2019. Unlike the original trilogy, which used brand-new scans for restoration, these are up-scaled versions of the digital master files used for the 2011 Blu-Ray release, with some improvements to picture quality. For The Phantom Menace, visible instances of digital video noise reduction (DVNR) that were present in the Blu-ray release have been removed, restoring much of the original picture. Like the original trilogy, these restorations were released to 4K Blu-ray as part of the Skywalker Saga' box set.\n\n\u2022 All films\n\n\u2022 The 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare have been restored for all three prequel films due to the Disney-Fox merger earlier that year, minus the News Corporation byline. The 1997 Lucasfilm logo is replaced by the 2015 logo.\n\n\u2022 The aspect ratio has been changed slightly from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1.\n\n\u2022 Controversy\n\nMany fans were displeased by some of the changes Lucas has made. It is the most evergreen topic for fan criticism of George Lucas and is the most broadly accepted as inspiring legitimate objections. Re-release changes were also the first major cause of the reactionary criticism phenomenon that takes a vehemently anti-Lucas stance, known as \"Lucas bashing\". Even some people associated to the franchise have come to hate these changes, such as original trilogy producer Gary Kurtz, who felt that a movie is what it was at the time, which is one of his reasons for which he rails against changing movies all the time.\nGreedo shooting at Han is particularly contentious. In the 2004 Special Edition DVD set the shots are timed to occur almost simultaneously, with Greedos shot being just a hair faster and with Solo now effectively dodging his head out of the way from the blast. However, many argue that not only should Greedo not have made his shot, but that the scene undermines Solos character. Hans original action marked him as a tough, independent-minded character; having him respond to Greedo makes him appear weaker, though he is still nonchalant about killing him. This change was so controversial that it spanned a movement called \"Han shot first,\" a retort to Lucas assertion that Greedo shot first.\nThere was also controversy over Lucas decision to place Hayden Christensen in the end scene of Return of the Jedi instead of Sebastian Shaw, as well as replacing the heavy fan favorite \"Boba Fetts\" voice with Temuera Morrisons (Jango Fett). Many longtime fans feel that its disrespectful to the original trilogy, although others feel that it helps the two trilogies flow together better.\nThe altering of the dialogue between the Emperor and Vader has also been criticized as creating a contradiction, since it implies Vader does not realize Luke is his son until this moment, despite his being \"obsessed\" with finding Skywalker, mentioning him by name and pursuing him for the rest of the movie until this point. Defenders have argued that the scene is an improvement because it provides another blatant example of Vader plotting against his master by playing dumb in the face of this revelation.\nOther fans especially missed the \"songs\" that were altered in Return of the Jedi (\"Lapti Nek\" and \"Yub Nub\"). They point out that the new music makes the Ewok's dancing and antics seem out of place (for example the \"Stormtrooper Helmet drums\" were beat in sync with the original music in the theatrical version). Others have argued that the new flute music and pan over shots of the planets being liberated makes a more effective end to the entire saga, rather than just a celebration of the single battle. The alteration of \"Lapti Nek\" into the new \"Jedi Rocks\" to many critics helps to undermine the serious nature and threat of Jabba the Hutt and his evil henchmen. They characterize the new sequence as \"cartoonish,\" with overt pandering to Boba Fett \"fanboys\" by introducing superfluous shots of Don Bies in the bounty hunter suit.\nA final alteration, unique to the 2004 DVD release, is that of lightsaber discoloration. In the scene in Episode IV where Luke trains against the practice droid aboard the Millennium Falcon, his lightsaber blade is inexplicably given a faint (but distinct) green color. Also, Vaders blade, in particular, is given a \"pink\" hue throughout the original trilogy. Perhaps the largest infraction is a scene in which two blades are seen to pass \"through\" one another during the final climax of Episode VI. This appears to be the result of color balance changes for the 2004 release.\nOn December 9, 2005, a new set of Star Wars original trilogy DVDs were released, also with the label \"Limited Edition\". However, it was merely a repackaged and discounted version of the 2004 set with no changes, and no original versions (despite packaging that some felt was misleading in that it used the original theatrical film posters, as if to imply that these were the original versions). The set was discounted in price, with the fourth (bonus) disc from the previously released 2004 set removed.\nReportedly, nostalgia for the original versions of the original Star Wars Trilogy on a high quality format has driven up the demand for the Laser Disc editions of the movies released prior to 1997, as well as the proliferation of fan made DVD's, often encoded from the Laser Disc originals. How far the demand will go depends upon sales of the current \"official\" releases of the original versions of the classic trilogy on DVD.\nIn 2019, George Lucas gave his approval for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to screen a non-Special Edition 70mm print of A New Hope (alongside Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). The print in question was a negative from the United Kingdom used for the film's 1981 re-release, which featured the aforementioned opening crawl modifications.\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Changes in Star Wars re-releases\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Online archive of Star Wars coverage at American Cinematographer, including interviews regarding the 1997 edition\n\n\u2022 DVD Active - A New Hope Differences between versions of A New Hope\n\n\u2022 DVD Active - The Empire Strikes Back Differences between versions of The Empire Strikes Back\n\n\u2022 DVD Active - Return of the Jedi Differences between versions of Return of the Jedi\n\n\u2022 DVD Active - The Prequel Trilogy Differences between versions of The Prequel Trilogy\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Trilogy - 2004 DVD Changes\n\n\u2022 Lucas Reveals Changes for Star Wars DVDs\n\n\u2022 Whose Star Wars is it, anyway?\n\n\u2022 Five major changes in the Star Wars DVD\n\n\u2022 The Starkillers Guide to the Mono Sound Mix of Star Wars Website about differences between the mono and original stereo version of A New Hope.'

It is a high-selling [[Star Wars]] video game following the many adventures of several characters. The two games are very similar, as both revolve around troopers from various factions fighting in different locales. ''Battlefront II'', however, includes elements and missions from [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], as well as enhanced aspects of gameplay including space combat and the ability to play as \"heroes\", certain iconic [[Light side of the Force/Legends|Light Side]]/[[Dark side of the Force/Legends|Dark Side]] characters from the Star Wars franchise, which previously only appeared as AI-controlled NPCs.\n\nThe game's campaign mode is entitled ''Rise of the Empire''. The story takes the player on different missions throughout the galaxy as part of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]], also known as Vader's Fist, form the perspective of a [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone trooper]] veteran.\n\nOther game modes include \"Instant Action\" where the player can fight on any battleground, land or space, and \"Galactic Conquest\" where the player fights as a certain faction for control of the galaxy.\n\nThe game was released on [[November 1]], [[2005]], for the [[Wikipedia:Personal computer|PC]], Mobile phone, [[Wikipedia:Xbox|Xbox]], [[Wikipedia:PlayStation Portable|PlayStation Portable]], and [[Wikipedia:PlayStation 2|PlayStation 2]], the same day that [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']] was released on DVD.<ref name=\"LucasArts\">{{LucasArtsCite|url=press/releases/102.html|text=The Ultimate ''Star Wars'' Celebration Rocks the Galaxy Nov. 1 with Simultaneous Debuts of ''Revenge of the Sith'' DVD and ''Star Wars Battlefront II'' Game}}</ref>\n\nThe first game and ''Battlefront II'' were re-released on [[March 14]], [[2024]] as the ''[[Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection]]''.<ref name=\"Classic Collection\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection|text=''Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection'' Available Now &ndash; Updated}}</ref>\n\n==New Features==\n*Improved single-player experience that includes improved AI enemies and allies. A greater emphasis is also placed on storytelling through open-ended mission-based objectives.\n*Revamped Galactic Conquest mode that plays out on a galactic scale.\n*New space battles that allows the player to dogfight in [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wings]], [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter/Legends|TIE Fighters]], [[Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor/Legends|Jedi interceptors]], [[BTL Y-wing starfighter/Legends|Y-Wings]], and several other [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]]. Players are also able to board [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ships]] and engage in combat with other enemies in different sections of the ships.\n*More than 12 new battlefields on land and in space, including many from ''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' such as [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]], [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]] and [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]]. Also included are all-new classic trilogy locations including the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] interior, and [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']]. However, some of the original battlefronts from the first game, such as Rhen Var, have been removed.\n*Special opportunities throughout the game for players to wield a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and use their favorite [[The Force/Legends|Force]] powers as [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] characters depending on the battlefront.\n*Three new classes: ''Engineer'' (Land) and ''Marine'' (Space). Engineer replaces the Pilot on land as the Pilot is now the primary Space Class. The third is a special \"officer\" that varies depending on the player's faction. For example, the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] forces can choose to become Clone Commanders, while players siding with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|CIS]] can make use of [[IG-100 MagnaGuard/Legends|IG-100 MagnaGuards]].\n*Online multiplayer action for up to 24 players on PS2, up to 32 on Xbox or up to 64 on Windows (plus AI units).\n*Wi-Fi (wireless) compatible, up to four players wireless multiplayer (PSP).\n*Engineer/Pilot units can hijack enemy vehicles by using their fusioncutters to rip open hatches and pull the enemy outside before climbing in and stealing the vehicle.\n*Players will be able to change the reinforcement count in Instant Action from 150 for quick skirmishes up to 750 per team for epic battles.\n*New and better GUI for better gameplay.\n*New Instant Action Modes: Hunt, Capture the Flag, XL (PC only) and Hero Assault, where players can fight it out as every hero and villain in the game.\n*Players can change their character at any friendly Command Post.\n*Players can earn awards with units. For example, any unit can obtain the \"Endurance\", \"Guardian\", and \"War Hero\" awards, but only Snipers can earn \"Marksman\", only Engineers can earn \"Regulator\", and only Soldiers and Marines can earn \"Frenzy\".\n*Players may now \"Sprint\", running faster than usual, making getting around the battlefront easier.\n\n==Training==\nThe game contains an optional training mission on Geonosis. This mission takes the player around a battlefield and teaches them all of the various methods of fighting a battle. The mission consists of the following tasks:\n*Reach a specific point on the map.\n*Eliminate three droid scouts, all [[B2-series super battle droid/Legends|B2 super battle droids]].\n*Destroy a damaged [[IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank/Legends|Hailfire droid]].\n*Capture a command post next to a downed [[Hardcell-class interstellar transport/Legends|Techno Union ship]].\n*Repair two droids, one for health and the other for ammunition.\n*Destroy a spider droid with an [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer/Legends|All Terrain Tactical Enforcer]].\n*Seize a holocron dropped by a dead [[Geonosian/Legends|Geonosian]].\n*Capture a command post at the top of a mountain.\n*Use a sniper rifle to eliminate three more droids.\n*Destroy a spider droid with a rocket launcher.\n*Eliminate ten enemies as [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]].\n*Take over the CIS main bunker.\n\nThe 501st Legion was not created until after the Battle of Geonosis, but a clone trooper who would later become a member of the 501st compiled this journal entry:\n\n<blockquote>''My first day as a member of the 501st... it was hot, sandy, chaotic. Nothing at all like the simulations on Kamino. Of course that's pretty much the way it was for all of us, wasn't it? All that breeding, all those years of training, it doesn't really prepare you for the all the screaming, or the blood, does it? Frankly I'm amazed we ever made it past the first hour, never mind the first day.''\n<br /><br />\n''Incredibly, the 501st survived the crucible of Geonosis, emerging battle-hardened, and ready for whatever the war would throw at us.''</blockquote>\n\n==Campaign mode==\nIn Campaign Mode, the player follows the campaigns of the 501st Legion as told through the [[501st Journal]]. As players progress through the game, they play as a clone trooper during the reign of the Republic and as a stormtrooper during the reign of the Empire.\n\nThe action brings players to multiple planets through a story arc that stretches from the dawn of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] to the [[Declaration of a New Order|formation of the Empire]] and later, bridging the gap between Episodes III and [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|IV]].\n\nUnlike the first Battlefront, Battlefront II's campaign gives players certain objectives with a given number of reinforcements with the enemy's reinforcements unlimited and an occasional time limit rather than playing an ordinary conquest match.

The clone troopers fight alongside Darth Vader against Jedi Temple Security Guards and Jedi. Because the mission is told from the perspective of the clone troopers, the Temple Guardians and Jedi in this mission are set as Rebels.\n\n*This mission shows a raid on Naboo's capital city, [[Theed/Legends|Theed]], where [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Apailana/Legends|Apailana]] is hiding a group of surviving Jedi she has made her personal bodyguards. The Empire fights the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]] on the streets of Theed. Like with Operation: Knightfall, this sees the RNSF and Jedi as Rebels, especially considering the RNSF use Rebel [[AAC-1 speeder tank]]s.\n\n*The missions '''Preventive Measures''' and '''Tying up Loose Ends''' show the skirmish between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] and [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|CIS forces]] in space around [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]] and on the planet's surface. In these two missions, a rogue [[Geonosian/Legends|Geonosian]] engineer by the name of [[Gizor Dellso]] has reactivated the hidden [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|droid]] factory on [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]]. The 501st must first eliminate space defenses, then land on the planet and assault the factory, eliminating Dellso before he can reignite the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].\n\n*The mission '''Changing of the Guard''' pits the Empire against rogue [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]]. The Prime Minister of [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]] has been secretly growing a new Clone Army, bred to take up arms against the Empire. [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] hires [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] for his knowledge of the inner workings of the clone facility and sends the 501st to Kamino to destroy the cloning facility with Boba's help due to his time spent there when he was younger with his father, [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango]].\n\n*The Anti-Troopers the Empire fights are clones with the palette of heavy troopers and [[Clone jet trooper/Legends|jet troopers]] with blaster/sniper rifles and are set as \"Republic\".\n\n===Bosses===\nCertain levels of the campaign require the elimination of an important person or persons in order to win the battle.\n\n*[[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]]&mdash;[[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]]\n*[[Jedi Temple/Legends|Jedi Temple]]&mdash;[[Three Jedi Masters]]\n*[[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]&mdash;Queen [[Apailana/Legends|Apailana]]\n*[[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]]&mdash;[[Gizor Dellso]]\n*[[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]]&mdash;Rebel [[Death Star prisoner|Jedi Padawan]]\n*[[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']]&mdash;Princess [[Leia Organa Solo/Legends|Leia Organa]]\n*[[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]&mdash;[[Bothan High Command]]\n\n==Galactic Conquest==\nThe Galactic Conquest mode in ''Star Wars: Battlefront II'' has been completely revamped. In this new mode, players build and maintain fleets and try to achieve galactic dominance by conquering enemy worlds. A map of the [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] shows planets controlled by the player, enemy-controlled planets, and pockets of empty space. Since there is only one map per planet (except Tatooine, even though Jabba's Palace is not in this mode) Planets can only be controlled by one side or the other, unlike the first game, where planets could be neutral.\n\n===Play===\nTo attack a hostile planet, the player moves their fleet to the enemy planet. If an enemy [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ship]] is in orbit around the planet, the battle begins in space; otherwise a skirmish begins on the surface. A space battle also ensues if two enemy fleets meet in empty space.\n\nIn space battles, the losing faction loses their fleet. If the victor is attacking a hostile planet, a ground battle begins directly after the victory.\n\nAt the end of the battle, a summary shows what has occurred and displays how many [[Galactic Credit Standard/Legends|credits]] were earned in the battle. The credit values for winning and losing vary based on the planet conquered as well as the number of planets already controlled by the faction.\n\nEach faction begins with one fleet. The cost to build more fleets depends on the number of fleets already in play. For example, Team 1 owns one fleet and wants to purchase another for 1000 credits. Team 1 then wishes to buy another fleet, which costs 2000 credits.\n\nThe game ends when one side loses all of their planets and fleets.\n\n===Class Purchases===\nEach faction begins with the basic trooper for land battles and the pilot for space battles. They also begin with 1000 credits. At the beginning of any turn, the player has the option to purchase another class. The costs vary based on the class.\n\n====List of Classes and their Cost====\n*'''Infantry''': Free\n*'''Heavy Weapons''': 1000\n*'''Sniper''': 1000\n*'''Engineer''':1000\n*'''Special 1''': 1800\n*'''Special 2''': 1800\n*'''Pilot''': Free (Space Only)\n*'''Marine''': 800 (Space Only)\n\n===Bonuses===\nThe bonuses return from the first game, although more strategy is involved. Instead of controlling the planets to gain these bonuses, the player must purchase them at the beginning of their turn. These bonuses can be used to aid their forces, protect command posts, or harm enemy units. However, once the bonus has been used it will need to be bought again. A player can have a maximum of 3 bonuses at a time.\n\n====List of Bonuses====\n*Energy Boost: Causes the player's unit's energy gauge to replenish faster after being depleted (200 credits)\n*Supplies: Increases amount of ammunition and other supplies the player's units can carry (200)\n*Reinforced Garrison: Adds extra troops to the player's reinforcement bank if it drops too low (200)\n*[[Autoturret/Legends|Auto Turrets]]: Automatically reinforces the player's command posts with defense grid turrets (400)\n*[[Bacta/Legends|Bacta]] Tanks: Causes the health of all the player's units to automatically regenerate at a constant rate (400)\n*Combat Shielding: Gives the player's units an extra reserve of health upon entering the battlefield (400)\n*[[Saboteur/Legends|Sabotage]]: Causes all enemy vehicles to suffer damage upon spawning in (600)\n*Enhanced [[Blaster/Legends|Blasters]]: Amplifies the damage of all blaster-type weapons for the player's team (600)\n*Leader: Activates the player's faction's playable hero for planetary battles (800)\n\n===Scenarios===\nThere are four different starting scenarios. If the player takes the enemy's base planet (bolded in the following list), he/she obtains twice the number of credits than normal, and that planet is permanently removed from gameplay.\n*'''Birth of the Rebellion:''' '''[[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]]''', [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]], [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]\n*'''Republic Sovereignty:''' '''[[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]]''', [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]\n*'''Dark Reign of the Empire:''' '''[[Endor/Legends|Endor]]''', [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]]\n*'''The Confederate Uprising:''' '''[[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]]''', [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]], [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]]\n\n====Endings====\n=====Birth of the Rebellion=====\nStates that the Rebellion has liberated the galaxy, ends with [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]] being thrown into the [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star II]] reactor and the liberation of planets as [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] rebuilds the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Order on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. A celebration with fireworks is held on [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], and [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. [[Heroes of Yavin/Legends|Heroes of Yavin]] are seen reunited. \"A New Hope and End Credits\" is played. '''(Note: This is the only canon ending to a scenario due to the events of the Original Trilogy.)'''\n\n=====Republic Sovereignty=====\nStates that the Republic has reclaimed the galaxy, ends with the defeat of [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] at [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]], and Darth Sidious is killed by Mace Windu. [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] becomes a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]]. [[Ki-Adi-Mundi/Legends|Ki-Adi-Mundi]], [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]], [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]] and [[Stass Allie/Legends|Stass Allie]] are not killed by their troops, as Order 66 never occurred. The clones remain loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Order. Galactic Civil War never occurs, and Anakin does not become Darth Vader. \"[[Star_Wars_Episode_III:_Revenge_of_the_Sith_(soundtrack)#Anakin_Vs._Obi-Wan|Anakin vs. Obi-Wan]]\" (a variation of the \"[[Battle of the Heroes]]\") is played.\n\n=====Dark Reign of the Empire=====\nStates that the Empire has conquered the galaxy, [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] captures [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and leaves him encased in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] at [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]]. [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] captures [[Leia Organa Solo/Legends|Princess Leia]] and is seen [[Telekinesis/Legends#Choking powers|Force choking]] her on the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']]. The Imperials push back the Rebel forces on [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] and defeat them in a space battle as well. Luke surrenders, and is shown bowing down to Palpatine on the Death Star II. The Emperor and Darth Vader rule the Galaxy. \"The Imperial March\" plays.\n\n=====The Confederate Uprising=====\nStates that the CIS has conquered the galaxy, ends with the [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|Droid Army]] annihilating [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] forces. Then they lead an attack on the [[Jedi Temple/Legends|Jedi Temple]] with Darth Sidious as their leader. Anakin and [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] are shown dueling on Mustafar. Dooku kills Anakin on a bridge above a lava reservoir. Darth Maul and Jango Fett are show to be alive and well, battling the Republic on various planets. General Grievous hunts down and kills the remaining Jedi. \"Duel of the Fates\" plays.\n\n==New modes==\nIn addition to the single player storyline, Galactic Conquest, and both single- and multiplayer Instant Action, Battlefront II has several new game modes &ndash; Hunt, Capture the Flag, Hero Assault, and XL, a PC-only single player mode. There is also a glitch on the PS2 and PC versions of the game: when zooming in between Mustafar and Endor and pressing pause, two extra modes appear: Team Deathmach and Team CP. However, both are unplayable without modding the game.\n\n===Hunt Mode===\nHunt mode operates much like Assault mode. An army of indigenous forces (e.g., Wampas) and a faction (e.g., Rebel Alliance), fight each other to reach a set number of points first. This mode is somewhat unbalanced, as some forces are stronger than others; for example, the [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] scenario pits rock-wielding [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] against the [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout trooper]]. The Ewoks are technically more powerful due to the scout trooper's role in the game as sniper infantry.\n\n====Hunt Mode Scenarios====\n*[[Endor/Legends|Endor]]: [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] (sharp rocks, tribal spear) vs. [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout troopers]] ([[Sniper rifle/Legends|sniper rifle]], [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]], [[Autoturret/Legends|autoturret]])\n*[[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]]: [[Geonosian/Legends|Geonosians]] ([[Geonosian sonic blaster|sonic blaster]]) vs. [[Clone sharpshooter/Legends|clone sharpshooters]] ([[Sniper rifle/Legends|sniper rifle]], [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]], [[Autoturret/Legends|autoturret]])\n*[[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]]: [[Wampa/Legends|Wampas]] ([[Claw/Legends|claw]]) vs. Rebel Infantry (All Variations)\n*[[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]: [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] ([[Bowcaster/Legends|bowcaster]], [[Fusioncutter/Legends|fusioncutter]] or [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]]) vs. [[IG-100 MagnaGuard/Legends|IG-100 MagnaGuards]] ([[Bulldog RLR|Bulldog Rocket Launcher]], [[RD-4 grenade launcher|Radiation Launcher]], Neuro Poison, [[Probe droid|Recon droid]])\n*[[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]: [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]] ([[Ion blaster/Legends|Ion blaster]], [[Fusioncutter/Legends|fusioncutter]]) vs. [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] ([[Cycler rifle/Legends|Bolt Action Rifle]] or [[Cycler rifle/Legends|Tusken cycler]])\n*[[Theed/Legends|Naboo]]: [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]] ([[Fusioncutter/Legends|fusioncutter]], [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]]) vs. [[B2-series super battle droid|super battle droids]] ([[Wrist blaster/Legends|wrist blaster]], [[TriShot]], [[Wrist rocket/Legends|wrist rocket]])\n*[[Rhen Var/Legends|Rhen Var]] (Xbox Live download): [[Wampa/Legends|Wampas]] (claw) vs. Rebel Infantry (All Variations)\n\n===Capture the Flag===\nCapture the Flag, or CTF for short, is another mode available for play on all maps (including space maps). In CTF, two factions try to capture a flag and return it to a base. Points are awarded to the team for the number of flags recovered. Winners are determined by the number of flags captured, either by a set number of captures or a time limit. When a Jet or Dark Trooper picks up the flag they can't fly. When Jedi pick up the flag they will not be able to use Force Jump or Force Hover. Droidekas cannot pick up the flag while in ball mode. Some rules vary depending on the variations present in the game, 1-flag and 2-flag.\n\n====1-flag CTF====\nIn 1-flag CTF, a neutral flag is placed approximately halfway between each faction's bases. The objective is to capture the flag and bring it to the opposite faction's base. This is the only CTF mode available for Space maps and some close to big maps like Yavin 4 or Hoth.\n\n====2-flag CTF====\n2-flag CTF resembles traditional Capture the Flag. It involves two factions which both hold a flag at their respective bases. The player must steal the flag from the enemy's base and return it to their own base.\n\n===Hero Assault Mode===\nThis mode, taking place only on the [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] map, pits multiple copies of the game's playable Heroes against multiple copies of the playable Villains.\n\nThe game plays out much like a Space Assault mode battle: the two teams battle each other to gain a set amount of points. The team to reach that number first wins.\nIn the Xbox Live download players are able to play Hero Assault mode at [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. It plays out with the Heroes controlling the sea wall and Villains attacking from the island.\n\n===XL===\nThis mode is only available on the PC in single player mode on the Kashyyyk, Hoth, and Geonosis maps. The idea is similar to Assault mode. When the player's team is the first to reach a certain number of points, victory is declared. The mode also limits the command posts, so that none can be captured or lost. The difference between XL and Assault is that in Assault there are always 180 obtainable points for each team, while in XL there can be more than 300 soldiers on each side. This mode is only available in the PC version because the PC is the only system able to calculate the huge numbers of entities.\n\n==Troop classes==\nA total of eight classes are available to play &ndash; six for land, two for space. Each offers a different battlefield function. Almost all classes are identical for each faction, keeping the game balanced. The \"Unique\" class is different for each side and varies with the map. In the instant action mode you can add units if points increase like wookiee warrior or CIS Magna Guard.\n\n===Land Classes/Infantry===\n====Soldier Class====\nThe '''Trooper''', or '''Soldier Class''' is a well-rounded class that serves as the keystone of the armies. They have a notable weakness against Vehicles, but can destroy one in groups, and are effective in nearly every situation, from close combat firefights to long range suppressive fire. They carry blaster rifles which are effective at short, medium, as well as long ranges. These soldiers also carry 4 [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonators]], while other classes can only carry 2. Because of their rapid-fire blaster rifles, troopers are often the frontline troops and are best at taking out enemy infantry head-on. They are fairly well-balanced in terms of speed, firepower, and endurance.\n\nThe soldiers of each faction are:\n*Galactic Republic: [[Clone trooper/Legends|Clone Trooper]] ([[DC-15A blaster rifle/Legends|DC-15 blaster rifle]], [[DC-15S/Legends|DC-15s blaster pistol]], [[V-1 thermal detonator]])\n*CIS: [[B2-series super battle droid/Legends|Super Battle Droid]] ([[Wrist blaster/Legends|wrist blaster]], [[TriShot|Tri Shot]], [[Wrist rocket/Legends|wrist rocket]])\n*Rebel Alliance: [[Rebel trooper/Legends|Rebel Soldier]] ([[DH-17 blaster rifle/Legends|DH-17 blaster rifle]], [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol/Legends|DL-44 blaster pistol]], [[Class-A thermal detonator/Legends|Class-A thermal detonators]])\n*Galactic Empire: [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtrooper]] ([[E-11 blaster rifle/Legends|E-11 blaster rifle]], [[SE-14r light repeating blaster/Legends|SE-14r light repeating blaster pistol]]/[[Scout trooper blaster pistol/Legends|scout trooper blaster pistol]] (depending on console), [[Baradium-core code key thermal detonator|baradium-core thermal detonators]])\n\n====Heavy Weapons Class====\nThe '''Heavy Weapons Class''' is a common division in most armies. It consists of soldiers armed with missile launchers that are able to lock-on and home in on vehicles, primarily used to destroy vehicles and turrets. They also carry two thermal detonators, mines, and a light blaster pistol for short-range protection. As one of the heaviest units, they have one of the highest endurance and defense and can sustain a lot more damage than units from other classes. They are, however, one of the slowest units in the game, and as their launchers cannot lock on to non-vehicle targets and require reloading after each shot, they are not well suited for dealing with groups of enemy infantry. In addition to their missile launchers, heavy troopers are equipped with a standard blaster pistol as a side-arm, thermal detonators, and proximity mines. These mines emit an obvious red-glow and will not be set off by a teammate, although it can still kill them if they are caught in the blast radius.\n\nThe heavy weapon specialists of each faction are:\n*Galactic Republic: [[Clone heavy assault trooper|Clone Heavy Trooper]] ([[PLX-1/Legends|PLX rocket launcher]], [[DC-15S/Legends|DC-15s blaster pistol]], [[V-1 thermal detonator]]s, [[HX2 antipersonnel mine|HX2 mines]])\n*CIS: [[Assault battle droid|Assault Battle Droid]] ([[E-60R missile launcher|E-60R rocket launcher]], [[SE-14 blaster pistol]], [[V-1 thermal detonator]]s, [[HX2 antipersonnel mine|HX2 mines]])\n*Rebel Alliance: [[Rebel Vanguard/Legends|Rebel Vanguard]] ([[HH-15 projectile launcher|HH-15 rocket launcher]], [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol]], [[Class-A thermal detonator/Legends|Class-A thermal detonators]] , [[3HX3 timer mine|3HX3 mines]])\n*Galactic Empire: [[Imperial shock trooper/Legends|Shock Trooper]] ([[MiniMag shoulder-launched proton torpedo launcher|PTL rocket launcher]], [[SE-14r light repeating blaster/Legends|SE-14r light repeating blaster pistol]]/[[Scout trooper blaster pistol/Legends|scout trooper blaster pistol]] (depending on console), [[Baradium-core code key thermal detonator|baradium-core thermal detonators]], [[KE-6b mine]]s)\n\n====Sniper Class====\nThe '''Sniper Class''' consists of snipers who are equipped with extremely high powered long-range rifles. It takes a single headshot to kill every unit except Heroes and droidekas. Often, snipers operate in elevated positions, away from the center of battle, where they can quietly eliminate an entire team without being noticed. They are the ultimate unit for long-range fighting and also work well at medium ranges and can also deploy auto-turrets for extra defense. While their long-range sniper rifles make them effective units in dealing with infantry, they also make them the weakest units in taking out vehicles and enclosed turrets, being able to deal practically no damage to artillery. Moreover, their rifles are light and quick at aiming even at close ranges, but the slow rate-of-fire and light armor make them nevertheless inefficient at directly facing groups of soldier units. Being the lightest troops in the game, they have the fastest speed at the cost of having the least endurance.\n\nThe snipers of each faction are:\n*Galactic Republic: [[Clone sharpshooter/Legends|Clone Sharpshooter]] ([[DC-15x sniper rifle/Legends|DC-15x sniper rifle]], [[DC-15S/Legends|DC-15s blaster pistol]], [[V-1 thermal detonator]]s, [[Autoturret/Legends|autoturret]])\n*CIS: [[Battle droid assassin|Assassin Droid]] ([[E-5s sniper rifle/Legends|E-5s sniper rifle]], [[SE-14 blaster pistol]], [[V-1 Thermal Detonator]]s, [[Autoturret/Legends|autoturret]])\n*Rebel Alliance: [[Rebel Marksman/Legends|Rebel Marksman]] ([[E-17d sniper rifle/Legends|E-17d sniper rifle]], [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol]], [[Class-A thermal detonator/Legends|Class-A thermal detonators]], [[Autoturret/Legends|autoturret]])\n*Galactic Empire: [[Scout trooper/Legends|Scout Trooper]] ([[E-11s sniper rifle/Legends|E-11s sniper rifle]], [[SE-14r light repeating blaster/Legends|SE-14r light repeating blaster pistol]]/[[Scout trooper blaster pistol/Legends|scout trooper blaster pistol]] (depending on console), [[Baradium-core code key thermal detonator|baradium-core thermal detonators]], [[Autoturret/Legends|autoturret]])\n\n====Engineer Class====\nThe '''Engineer Class''' are the troopers called to provide battlefield repairs and act as medics and ammo suppliers. It consists of engineers (or technicians) who carry handheld shotguns and explosive [[Detonation pack|detpacks]], which, unlike the proximity mines of heavy weapon specialists, can be detonated remotely. They also carry fusioncutters, which can repair allied vehicles, construct and repair turrets, or slice into enemy vehicles. Their shotguns are extremely deadly at close-range, but nevertheless the cost of rate-of-fire usually makes them inferior to the faster firing soldiers. Because of this, engineers mainly serve as support units for the main-line assault units. Their speed is secondary compared to that of snipers and are also second to them in terms of weakest endurance and defense.\n\nThe engineers of each faction are:\n*Galactic Republic: [[Clone engineer]] ([[Shotgun/Legends|shotgun]], [[F-187 fusioncutter]], [[Detonation pack|detpacks]], [[Miniature bacta tank|health]] and [[Ammo canister|ammo dispenser]])\n*CIS: [[Engineer battle droid|Engineer Droid]] (shotgun, [[F-187 fusioncutter]], [[Detonation pack|detpacks]], [[Miniature bacta tank|health]] and [[Ammo canister|ammo dispenser]])\n*Rebel Alliance: [[Smuggler/Legends|Rebel Smuggler]] ([[CR-1 blaster cannon/Legends|CR-1 blaster cannon]], [[F-187 fusioncutter]], [[Detonation pack|detpacks]], [[Miniature bacta tank|health]] and [[Ammo canister|ammo dispenser]])\n*Galactic Empire: [[Imperial gunner/Legends|Imperial Engineer]] ([[blast cannon]], [[F-187 fusioncutter]], [[Detonation pack|detpacks]], [[Miniature bacta tank|health]] and [[Ammo canister|ammo dispenser]])\n\n====Special Class 1====\n''Star Wars: Battlefront II'' introduces an extra special unit class. Each unit within this class have their own unique set of weapons and equipment. Each unit of this class has their own ability to affect those around them, either increasing stats of their teammates or decreasing health of enemies. In contrast to the other previous classes, a player must unlock 8 points in a battle before being able to use a unit from the first special class.\n\nThe special units of each faction are:\n*[[Galactic Marines/Legends|Clone Commander]] (Galactic Republic) ([[Z-6 rotary blaster cannon/Legends|chaingun]], DC-15s Blaster Pistol, Rally [Defense Increase], [[Mark IV recon droid]])\nThe clone commander's signature weapon, the rapid-firing chaingun, is most effective in more enclosed areas against a small number of enemies. The chaingun is, arguably, the best gun in the game, as it can quickly eliminate multiple enemies under its incredible rate of fire. However, it has a short delay before firing as its barrels spin up and is ineffective against vehicles and turrets, being comparable to that of the sniper rifle's power on vehicles. Commanders carry a blaster pistol for short range protection and emergency use if their chaingun is overheated or did not have time to spin up. They can also use Rally to temporarily boost all nearby friendly troops' morale and increase their resistance to damage, thus a team is at its most effective when traveling with a Clone Commander. In addition, they have a recon droid to serve as short-range reconnaissance. The recon droid, although is has a limited period of time before exploding, can defend itself with a weak blaster or a self-destruct mechanism. Unfortunately, deploying a recon droid renders the user immobile and completely vulnerable to enemy fire while the droid itself is often destroyed while preparing to self-destruct, at which point it must remain immobile before detonating.\n*[[IG-100 MagnaGuard/Legends|MagnaGuard]] (Confederacy of Independent Systems) ([[Bulldog RLR]], [[RD-4 grenade launcher|radiation launcher]], [[Neurotoxin/Legends|Neuro Poison]], Mark IV recon droid)\nMagnaguards are advanced droids that carry an arsenal of explosive weapons. Their Bulldog RLR's missiles can lock onto an enemy (even infantry) and kill in one to two shots, or they could be launched rapidly without locking on. Their radiation launchers are ballistic weapons that dispense projectiles similar to grenades, and is itself a type of grenade launcher, but with almost no splash damage. Like the clone commanders they carry with them recon droids for reconnaissance. However, the Magnaguards' weapons have limited ammunition and a slower rate of fire, meaning that they are best used to provide supporting fire to supplement its allies. Moreover, they are equipped with one-use neuro poison dispenser, which slowly reduces the health of all nearby units (except droids) once activated, thereby eventually causing inevitable death.\n*[[Imperial commando/Legends|Imperial officer]] (Galactic Empire) ([[Imperial sonic blaster|sonic blaster]], [[V-6d mortar launcher]], Rage [Damage Increase], Mark IV recon droid)\nImperial officers have an arsenal similar to the Magnaguard's. Their primary weapon is a sonic blaster, quick-firing blasters with a wide-range but very low power, as is typical of sonic weapons in ''Battlefront''. Alongside this sonic gun is a mortar launcher, which fires grenades that can either explode on impact or delayed with a charged setting to allow ricochet. Just like the previous two units, Imperial officers are also each equipped with a recon droid. Their Rage bonus temporarily augments the firepower of nearby allies, thus serving most effectively when traveling in a group with friendly troops. Like the Magnaguard, the Imperial officer's weapons have limited ammo and a slow rate of fire, making them more of a support class to allies.\n*[[Bothan Spynet/Legends|Bothan Spy]] (Rebel Alliance) ([[Incinerator rifle|incinerator]], [Health] Regeneration, [[Stealth field generator/Legends|Stealth]], [[TB-47 time bomb]])\nBothan spies are units equipped for mostly stealth and strategic purposes. Their primary weapon is a short-range incinerator rifle that can quickly take out groups of enemies with increasing firepower. Despite its high rate-of-fire, however, the incinerator nevertheless takes more time to kill than a standard blaster rifle would in some cases. Because of this, it is usually used in conjunction with their stealth field generator, which allows them to become invisible. While invisible, a Bothan spy can utilize ambush tactics on their unaware enemy or capture command posts unseen. However, the user would be immediately forced out of stealth the moment they fire a wave of incinerating blasts, and if timed incorrectly, they can easily be taken out by a group of soldiers. Unlike the previous three special units, the recon droid is replaced with a sticky time bomb that detonates with a large concussive blast after 5 seconds. These bombs can be planted on an unsuspecting enemy turret. Finally, Bothans have the ability to gradually regenerate the health of all nearby comrades.\n\n====Special Class 2====\nLike the previous class, the second group of special units also defy categorization in terms of weapons and abilities. Therefore, each unit has their own strengths and weaknesses but cannot be used until a player earns a total of 12 points in a battle.\n\nThe advanced special units of each faction are:\n*[[Clone jet trooper/Legends|Clone jet trooper]] (Galactic Republic) ([[Electromagnetic pulse launcher|EMP launcher]], [[DC-17 hand blaster/Legends|DC-17 blaster pistol]], V-1 thermal detonators)\nClone jet troopers' main advantage is their agility, granted to them by their jetpacks, which allows them to quickly traverse great distances and gives them advantageous position over the enemy. Their EMP launchers fire devastating blasts of electromagnetism which, though slow-moving, can kill an enemy in one shot and eliminate a droideka's shield in two. They are equipped with a rapid-firing commando pistol as a sidearm, which is stronger than the regular blaster pistol. These units can be used to sneak up behind enemies using their jetpacks and ambush them from behind, then spring away to safety while they reload. They are the Republic's answer to the CIS droideka due to their agility in dodging the devastating laser bolts from destroyer droids and their EMP launcher's effectiveness in taking down their shields. However, they have gone down in defense and endurance since the previous game, and the electromagnetic blast radius of their EMP launchers also have a smaller splash damage radius than before. To accommodate their jetpack, they are impervious to fall damage.\n*[[Droideka/Legends|Droideka]] (Confederacy of Independent Systems) (repeating blasters, personal shield)\nDroidekas are arguably one of the most powerful special units in the game. Their twin repeating blasters are one of the most devastating in-game, and their personal shield emitters give them one of the strongest defense. Using their shield in conjunction with their blasters, they can easily mow down multiple troops. Because of this, they are well-suited to massive firefights. Their shields can also be used to protect allies behind the shield and allow them to reload weapons. The droideka is not without flaws, however. It can not enter vehicles, as the manual states that the droideka itself is considered a vehicle. Its shield lasts for twenty to thirty seconds and can quickly be dissipated under fire from large groups of enemies. Additionally, they must be rolled up into a ball in order to travel quickly from place to place. Although fast, they are completely vulnerable when in this mode, as they are unable to raise their shield or fire their weapons. To attack, they must be deployed into their open configuration, at which point they would be one of the slowest units in the game, only being able to move at a very slow speed and also having a limited horizontal rotation rate.\n*[[Dark Trooper/Legends|Dark Trooper]] (Galactic Empire) ([[ARC caster|arc caster]], SE-14r light repeating blaster pistol, baradium-core thermal detonators)\nThe dark trooper is the Imperial counterpart to the jet trooper. Their jump-packs can boost them off the ground very quickly, but unlike the jet trooper's jetpack, it sacrifices accuracy for speed and height. Their powerful arc casters fire a mid-ranged, wide bolt of electricity, which, when charged, can \"arc\" from one unit to up to four other units. They also carry a fast-firing commando pistol as a sidearm and, like the jet trooper, they can be used to gain an advantageous position over an enemy or ambush them from behind. As a result of their jump pack ability, they do not sustain fall damage.\n*[[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee Warrior]] (Rebel Alliance) ([[Bowcaster/Legends|Wookiee Bowcaster]], [[HH-4 grenade launcher]], Class A thermal detonators, [[Mark IV recon droid]])\nThe Wookiee warrior has the most stamina of all units, about twice of that of a normal soldier, which makes up for their lack of speed and slow-firing arsenal. Their high endurance makes them able to withstand far more damage, sometimes being able to survive even a grenade. They are heavy hitters, with a unique bowcaster that can fire a spread of deadly shots, or fire a large, powerful bolt when charged up. The hand-made bowcaster features a scope with two zoom capabilities and can be used as an effective sniper rifle when charged and zoomed. They carry grenade launchers that fire ballistic grenades, which explode after a few seconds when making contact with the ground. They also carry 4 thermal detonators to clear up large groups of enemies, and a recon droid to scout an area.\n\n===Space Classes/Naval Force===\n====Pilot Class====\nThe '''Pilot Class''' is used to launch assaults in space. Pilots are most useful in the cockpit of a starfighter, being able to automatically repair any ship they occupy. On the ground, they are each equipped with a commando pistol, time bombs, and fusion cutters. Although much more practical piloting a starfighter than fighting on-ground, their time bombs are the most effective at taking out critical systems from the interior of a capital ship. Their stamina, defense, and speed are roughly equivalent to that of an engineer.\n\nThe pilot class included:\n*[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]: [[Clone trooper pilot/Legends|Clone Pilot]] ([[DC-17 hand blaster/Legends|commando pistol]], F-187 fusioncutter, TB-47 time bombs)\n*[[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|CIS]]: [[OOM pilot battle droid/Legends|Pilot Droid]] (commando pistol, F-187 fusioncutter, TB-47 time bombs)\n*[[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]: [[Rebel pilot/Legends|Rebel Pilot]] (commando pistol, F-187 fusioncutter, TB-47 time bomb)\n*[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]: [[TIE pilot|Imperial Pilot]] (commando pistol, F-187 fusioncutter, TB-47 time bomb)\n\n====Marine class====\nThe marine class is a standard division of troops in most armies. They are trained to defend their capital ship in the event that it is boarded by enemy troops or to do vice versa. Marines are armed with portable rocket launchers for demolishing enemy ships, as well as regular [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] rifles and [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonators]]. Because they lack the ability to automatically repair any starfighter they occupy, they are not recommended to be used as bombers or dogfighters. Instead, they are most useful in raiding the enemy cruiser.\n\nThe marine class included:\n*[[Clone marine|Clone Marine]] ([[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]) (DC-15 blaster rifle, PLX rocket launcher, V-1 thermal detonators)\n*[[Droid marine]] ([[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]) ([[E-5 blaster rifle/Legends|E-5 blaster rifle]], [[E-60R missile launcher]], V-1 thermal detonator)\n*[[Alliance Special Forces/Legends|Rebel Marine]] ([[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]) (DH-17 blaster rifle, HH-15 rocket launcher, Class A thermal detonators)\n*[[Imperial Marines/Legends|Imperial Marines]] ([[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]) (E-11 blaster rifle, PTL rocket launcher, baradium-core thermal detonators]])\n\n===Trooper Variants===\nOn certain levels, certain characters have outfit changes to match the environment or as seen in the Star Wars Movies. The following lists the levels where the classes have a special outfit instead of the standard that is used on all other maps.\n\n====Galactic Republic====\n*All [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]], except the clone commander: [[Phase I clone trooper armor/Legends|Phase I armor]]&mdash;[[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]]\n*[[Clone sharpshooter/Legends|Clone sharpshooter]]: [[Clone scout trooper/Legends|clone scout trooper]] outfit&mdash;[[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]], [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]] CTF\n\n====Confederacy of Independent Systems====\n*Assassin Droid: camouflage grass paint job&mdash;[[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]] and [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. sand paint job&mdash;[[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] and [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]]\n\n====Galactic Empire====\n*[[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]: [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] cloak&mdash;[[Jedi Temple/Legends|Jedi Temple]] (Campaign mode only)\n*All [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]] except [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]] and [[Dark Trooper/Legends|dark trooper]]: [[Snowtrooper/Legends|snowtrooper]] outfit&mdash;[[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]]\n*Imperial engineers : [[Vehicle Command Crewer|AT-AT pilot]]&mdash;Hoth\n\n====Rebel Alliance====\n*[[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]: Pilot outfit&mdash;[[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]], black [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] outfit&mdash;[[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]], [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]], [[Mygeeto/Legends|Mygeeto]], Coruscant\n*All [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]] except Rebel smuggler, [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] warrior, and [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] spy: snow outfit&mdash;[[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]], Gray outfit&mdash;[[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]], [[Polis Massa/Legends|Polis Massa]], jungle outfit&mdash;[[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], desert outfit&mdash;[[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]], ''Tantive IV'' outfit&mdash;[[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']], [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]]., ''aqua outfit''&mdash;[[Kamino/Legends|''Kamino'']],\n\n===Award Weapons===\nPlayers can earn weapon upgrades, depending on the soldier type. All reward weapons (excluding the Guidable Rockets) replace an existing weapon. It should be noted that some of the weapons can be either situationally weaker and/or more limited than the one it replaces. A prime example is the AWARD sniper rifle-the beam is ineffective in some situation where the regular sniper rifle is fine. In the event of trying to snipe a target from the top of a turret for example, where a head shot would be required, the AWARD rifle disregards headshots, but delivers an almost always instant kill body shot instead.\n\n{|{{Prettytable}}\n!Reward\n!Applies to\n!Ability\n!Replaces\n|-\n|Precision Pistol:\n|All Classes that wield a pistol\n|Fires faster, highly accurate and more powerful blaster bolts. However, the precision pistol has limited ammo, whereas the normal pistol has unlimited ammo and only overheats. Like Jango's Westar blaster.\n|Blaster Pistol, Commando Pistol\n|-\n|Elite Assault Rifle:\n|Trooper/Soldier Class, Marine Class\n|Fires higher powered purple blaster bolts, which are more powerful than a normal blaster rifle, resulting in very quick kills. It fires 3 shots in quick succession with one trigger pull (burst fire). Like Boba's rifle.\n|Blaster Rifle, Wrist Blaster\n|-\n|Guidable Rockets (Rocket Launcher):\n|Heavy Weapons Class, Marine Class\n|Fires a guidable rocket. Control is identical to a space guidable missile and Chewbacca's guidable rocket.\n|None (existing rocket launcher remains)\n|-\n|Flechette shotgun:\n|Engineer Class\n|Fires shrapnel which damages enemies even after collision with object. The shrapnel also does not spread as much, allowing for longer range. This is also the only AWARD weapon with more ammo than the regular weapon.\n|Shotgun, Blast Cannon\n|-\n|Beam Rifle:\n|Sniper Class\n|Fires a long-range powerful blaster beam, capable of firing through multiple enemies.\n|Sniper Rifle\n|-\n|}\n\n==Weapons and Gear==\n===Blaster and Projectile Weapons===\n*'''[[Wrist blaster/Legends|Wrist Blaster]]''': A blaster mounted on the wrist of a super battle droid. The weapon holds a clip of fifty rounds. Its rate of fire is slower than that of the blaster rifle. However, it deals slightly more amount of damage than a blaster rifle, and is more accurate.\n\n*'''[[TriShot]]''': A powerful wrist-mounted variant of a shotgun which fires three powerful rounds in a triangular pattern, hence the name. If all three rounds hit a normal soldier, they would be left with only one hit point. However, the weapon has a slow rate of fire and will overheat in just three shots.\n\n*'''[[Blaster rifle/Legends|Blaster rifle]]''': A rapid-firing, all-purpose rifle which fires blaster rounds that are effective at basically any range. The blaster rifle utilizes a fifty round clip. The trooper/soldier will carry between 200 to 300 rounds, depending on the military force in which he serves. The effectiveness of the weapon decreased with range, as the rifle would begin to lose much of its accuracy after several consecutive shots at long range.\n\n*'''[[Sniper rifle/Legends|Sniper rifle]]''': A high-powered, long-range rifle with two zoom settings for its scope. It has a slow rate of fire, but can provide a one-hit kill when targeting an enemy's head. The sniper rifle's clip size holds five beam rounds. The weapon is best used to eliminate enemies at a distance. However, the sniper rifle can be effective at close ranges when wielded by a skilled user.\n\n*'''[[Blast cannon]]''': This weapon fires a spread of eight rounds with each shot. The weapon has a slow rate of fire, and each of its clips holds only five rounds. The shotgun was most effective at close-quarters, where a target had a smaller range of motion. If fired at point-blank range, the weapon can kill with one shot.\n\n*'''[[Blaster pistol/Legends|Blaster pistol]]''': A blaster pistol which fires rounds weaker than those of a blaster rifle. It is primarily used as a sidearm for close-range combat. The blaster pistol has infinite ammunition. However, the weapon overheats after several successive shots, and must be allowed to cool before it can be fired again.\n\n*'''[[DC-17 repeater hand blaster|Commando Pistol]]''': A more potent variant of the aforementioned blaster pistol. The weapon deals more damage per round, fires faster, and cools more quickly than the standard blaster. The weapon is as effective as the blaster rifle when in the hands of a skilled user.\n\n*'''[[Chaingun/Legends|Chaingun]]''': A devastating weapon with six rotating barrels which give it an incredibly fast rate of fire. It takes a few seconds for the weapon to commence firing once it has been activated. However, once it begins to fire, the weapon reaches a high rate of fire quite quickly. The chaingun can fire for a long time before overheating, and it cools rapidly. The weapon is used to quickly eliminate multiple enemies at close and medium range and is effective at eliminating heroes. The weapon is also effective for point defense purposes as well.\n\n*'''[[Repeating blaster/Legends|Repeating blaster]]''': Twin heavy blasters mounted on the arms of droidekas. They have a high rate of fire and their rounds are equivalent to those of the blaster rifle. These blasters overheat quickly. When mounted upon droidekas, these weapons provide suppressive fire and can quickly cut down infantry that remain exposed.\n\n*'''[[Bowcaster/Legends|Bowcaster]]''': A handmade crossbow used by Wookiee Warriors. It features a scope with two zoom settings. The weapon fires a spread of small bolts. The bowcaster can also be charged up to fire a single bolt which has the same stopping power as a round from the sniper rifle.\n\n*[[Incinerator (weapon)|'''Incinerator''']]: A weapon that blasts forth a large, short-ranged wave of incinerating gases with each pull of the trigger. The weapon requires reloading after each round is fired. This weapon is most effective when using invisibility to sneak up on a small group of enemies and unleashing a huge wave of incendiary gases, damaging or killing multiple enemies at once.\n\n*'''[[Imperial sonic blaster|Sonic blaster]]''': A weapon which fires a large, short-ranged wave of sound that deals low to moderate damage upon a target.\n\n*'''[[ARC caster|ARC Caster]]''': An electronic rifle that fires a short-ranged wave of electricity. The wave will both stun and injure its target. The weapon can electrocute up to five targets simultaneously.\n\n===Explosive Weapons===\n*'''[[Thermal detonator/Legends|Thermal detonator]]''': The standard explosive for soldiers, these are grenade-like weapons that can stick to or bounce off surfaces. They are thrown by hand and were effective for clearing away small groups of enemies, especially in narrow hallways and could be used to provide cover fire as the user reloaded or retreated. They were also used to destroy armored installations, especially turrets. Thermal detonators release all the thermal energy when thrown into any liquid environment like a lake or pond... they explode faster than normal.\n\n*'''[[Detonation pack|Detpack]]''': One of the most powerful explosives in the game, the detpack can be placed on the ground or on a wall and detonated remotely. They can be used to destroy enemy defenses or eliminate infantry, but can be destroyed by a Thermal detonator.\n\n*'''[[Wrist rocket/Legends|Wrist rocket]]''': A slow-moving rocket fired from the wrist which would explode upon contact, resulting in a one-hit kill against infantry.\n\n*'''[[Mine/Legends|Mines]]''': An extremely powerful explosive, mines can be planted at areas that are often traversed by enemies, called choke points. When enemies stepped on a mine, it would explode, killing all enemies within its effective range. Three Mines can do significant damage to an AT-AT. However, they can be destroyed with thermal detonators, fusion cutters, and rocket launchers. Engineers can safely cross them and clear the mines by slicing them with their tool. Mines can destroy most tanks with one mine, and kill heroes with a one-hit kill.\n\n*'''[[Missile launcher/Legends|Missile launcher]]''': An extremely powerful weapon which launched powerful rockets with a large blast radius. These weapons are devastating to vehicles and can kill multiple enemies in one shot through an explosion. Rocket launchers have limited ammo and take a long time to reload after each shot, but can be effective against infantry in the hands of a skilled user. They are also effective in large firefights where the enemy is especially concentrated, though the user runs the risk of damaging allies. This weapon is capable of locking onto and tracking vehicles.\n\n*'''[[Electromagnetic pulse launcher|EMP Launcher]]''': A weapon which fires a single pulse of electromagnetic energy which, although slow-moving, can kill an enemy in one shot upon making contact. The EMP launcher is basically a rocket launcher modified for use against infantry, with a clip of two EM Power cells instead of rockets and a faster reloading time. However, the EMP has less splash damage and needs two direct hits to take down a Droideka's shield. The EMP launcher can be used on armored or multiple targets, especially when they are unaware.\n\n*'''[[Bulldog RLR]]''': A rocket launcher that can fire six small rockets at a relatively fast rate. This weapon can lock-on to enemies and will almost always result in a one-hit kill. The rockets are easy to dodge, less powerful than the EMP launcher, and have very little splash damage. They can be used at close range or when an enemy is caught off guard.\n\n*'''[[Grenade launcher/Legends|Grenade launcher]]/[[Mortar/Legends|Mortar launcher]]/[[RD-4 grenade launcher|Radiation Launcher]]''': These ballistic weapons fire grenades which explode a few seconds after making contact with a surface. These are effective against both infantry and vehicles. Of the three, the radiation launcher is the most potent, as its explosion lasts slightly longer but as a disadvantage it does not damage vehicles. All versions of this weapon can be charged up to reach long ranges through the battlefield. An enemy infantryman can be damaged by the projectile if the weapon is fully charged and the projectile itself hits the enemy.\n\n*'''[[Time bomb|Time Bomb]]''': A devastating bomb which detonates five seconds after being dropped. It is useful for shipboard sabotage, especially when they are dropped surreptitiously on a ship's hull just before it is launched, causing it to explode mid-flight. This bomb can eliminate or clear a massive wave of enemies. Only a powerful weapon like the detpack can destroy the time bomb.\n\n===Support Gear===\n*'''[[Autoturret/Legends|Autoturret]]''': Durable automatic turrets that are usually deployed to defend a command post or alert a sniper of approaching enemies. Though lacking in accuracy, these turrets are difficult to destroy and have a fast rate of fire.\n\n*'''[[Fusioncutter/Legends|Fusioncutter]]''': An all-purpose engineering tool that can be used to hijack vehicles, repair ammo droids, health droids, and vehicles, or construct turrets on a turret platform.\n\n*'''Ammo and Health Dispenser''': A dispenser which contains bacta and ammunition which can be used to aid allies or heal one's self. However, the ammunition canisters in the dispenser cannot replenish the dispenser amount.\n\n*'''[[Jetpack/Legends|Jetpack]]''': A tool that uses repulsorlift technology to allow the user to fly through the air at the cost of fuel. The jetpack is both accurate and fast, allowing the user to reach inaccessible places. Jango Fett, Boba Fett, and jet troopers use these.\n\n*'''[[Jump pack]]''': A type of jetpack that trades accuracy for height and speed. It projects the wearer in a large, sharp upward arc, landing them only a short distance away. It is far less accurate than the jetpack and spews dark smoke. Dark troopers use this.\n\n*'''[[Deflector emitter|Shield Emitter]]''': A tool which generates a powerful personal shield that lasts for a limited time before it has to regenerate. The shield can absorb twenty blaster rifle shots but lost power the longer it is used. Droidekas use these.\n\n*'''[[Stealth field generator/Legends|Stealth]]''': Bothan Spies use stealth to become nearly invisible. This ability depends on stamina, and the stamina is depleted by moving while under stealth. Strenuous actions such as rolling and sprinting while using stealth put the user at risk of being revealed. Stealth may also occasionally reveal the user briefly for no apparent reason.\n\n*'''[[Probe droid/Legends|Recon droid]]''': A hovering droid used to scout an area. It is remotely controlled, can fire small blaster shots, and can self-destruct. It can be stopped from exploding if shot while self-destructing, although its small size and agility makes this difficult.\n\n*'''Rally Bonus''': A bonus that makes enemy fire less damaging to oneself and nearby allies for a limited time.\n\n*'''Neuropoison''': Rapidly poisons nearby enemies, depleting their health bar at a fast rate for a limited time. They continue to lose health even after moving out of the poison's effective range.\n\n*'''Rage Bonus''': Increases the damage of oneself and nearby allies for a limited time.\n\n*'''Regeneration Bonus''': Rapidly heals oneself and nearby allies for a limited time. This is the only bonus that cannot be earned with an AWARD.\n\n===Hero Weapons and Gear===\n*'''[[Lightsaber/Legends|Lightsaber]]''': A hilt with a blade of plasma that can cut down enemies quickly and efficiently. This weapon is the signature weapon of both Jedi and Sith.\n\n*'''[[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|Double-bladed lightsaber]]''': A pair of lightsabers connected in the middle by their hilts. This unique lightsaber variant gives the user a larger reach and a wider range when the lightsaber is thrown. This is the signature weapon of Darth Maul.\n\n*'''[[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol/Legends|DL-44 heavy blaster pistol]]''': A powerful, one-shot kill blaster that fires two rounds with one trigger pull. This is the signature weapon of Han Solo.\n\n*'''[[Defender sporting blaster pistol/Legends|Defender sporting blaster pistol]]''': Somewhat a pistol version of a sniper rifle, with the same power and rate of fire. However, it overheats quickly. This is the signature weapon of Princess Leia.\n\n*'''Invulnerability''': Carried by Princess Leia, this bonus makes surrounding allies invulnerable to all enemy fire and explosives.\n\n*'''[[EE-3 carbine rifle/Legends|EE-3 carbine rifle]]''': This weapon is identical to the AWARD rifle, except for the fact that it fires red bolts, rather than purple. It fires three high-powered rounds that usually result in a one-hit kill. The weapon is used by Boba Fett.\n\n*'''[[WESTAR-34 blaster pistol/Legends|WESTAR-34 blaster pistol]]''': This weapon is identical to the award pistol. It fires powerful and accurate bolts at an extremely fast rate. It is semi-automatic and has one zoom setting. Jango Fett uses this pistol as his signature weapon.\n\n*'''[[Flamethrower/Legends|Flamethrower]]''': A weapon which fires a short-ranged blast of fire that sets enemies aflame, slowly depleting their health. The fire extinguishes after several seconds and could be put out faster by rolling. Jango and Boba Fett use this weapon\n\n*'[[Starblade|''Starblades''']]: A weapon commonly utilized by Asajj Ventress, this attack can be used without limit by the Sith Assassin as a highly deadly projectile.\n\n===Jedi and Sith Abilities===\nJedi and Sith have unique abilities which drain their stamina bar. Using the Force, these abilities extended the powers of the user beyond normal limits.\n\n'''Light Side Abilities'''\n\n*[[Telekinesis/Legends|Force Push]]: An ability that pushes multiple opponents away, often used to create more room for the user. This ability can also be used to knock over opponents so that the Jedi or Sith can close into lightsaber range while they are getting up. Also it can be used to push enemy units off cliffs or into shafts such as those on the Death Star map.\n\n*Force Pull: The opposite of Force Push, this ability pulls a single opponent towards the user, where they are finished off by the attacker's lightsaber. This ability is best used to pull opponents out of large melees to avoid damaging allies with the lightsaber at close range. Like Push, it can also be used to more rapidly disable then kill an enemy with a dangerous ranged weapon.\n\n*Force Destruction: A powerful seismic wave generated when a Force-sensitive leaps into the air and slams their lightsaber down. This move is extremely powerful and blow opponents away from the user. [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] and [[Kit Fisto/Legends|Kit Fisto]] are the only characters known to have this ability. [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] has a similar power with the difference being that lightning shoots up from the ground instead of a seismic wave. Heroes that do not have this ability will only perform a lightsaber attack consisting of a series of slashes when leaping into the air and attacking.\n\n*Force Orb: A throwable orb made of water, usable by Kit Fisto.\n\n'''Dark Side Abilities'''\n\n*Force Choke: An ability that lifts an opponent into the air and slowly chokes them. Darth Vader is a notorious user of this ability. Droids can be affected by this, despite being non-living, simply because it crushes their inner circuits rather than choking them.\n\n*[[Force lightning/Legends|Force Lightning]]: Lightning generated by a Force-sensitive that severely damages an enemy. The lightning can \"jump\" from person to person, behaving like arcing electricity. Darth Sidious and Count Dooku are well-known for their use of the ability.\n\n*Force Hover: This power is similar to Force Jump. The user will jump twice and hover temporarily instead of the usual ability to triple jump. As lightsaber attacks performed by leaping into the air and attacking while coming down are especially powerful, this move is useful for hovering over an opponent and delivering a devastating blow with the lightsaber down on them. Darth Vader and Darth Sidious often employ this unique Force ability.\n\n'''Neutral Abilities'''\n\n*Block: The Force-sensitive will block all enemy fire in front of them with their lightsaber for as long as the stamina bar holds out. By rapidly wielding his four lightsabers, General Grievous also has this ability, although he is not Force-sensitive.\n\n*[[Force jump/Legends|Force jump]]: A Force-sensitive will jump up to four times, except for Yoda, who jumps five. The maximum height for a Force jump is roughly equivalent to the maximum altitude at which a jet trooper can hover.\n\n*[[Force speed/Legends|Force Speed]]: A Force-sensitive will dash at very high speeds for as long as their stamina bar holds out. The Force-sensitive becomes hard to hit by all enemy fire.\n\n*Saber-Throw: A very common, powerful Force power. The lightsaber of the user becomes almost like a boomerang; the spinning lightsaber is thrown towards enemies, and can also deal damage when it automatically returns to the user. More powerful than the average strike with a lightsaber, this move could be used to clear the field of multiple enemies, especially on the lightsaber's return trip. Darth Maul, with his double-bladed lightsaber, often uses this ability, his thrown lightsaber having two times the radius of an average lightsaber. Duck or roll are primary infantry abilities used to dodge saber-throw. However, Yoda, Count Dooku, and Darth Sidious do not have this ability as a Jedi or Sith.\n\n==Heroes==\nAfter fulfilling the goals set in the Hero Options screen (e.g. earn 10 points), players are able to obtain the services of one of these Heroes to aid them. Each has a different ability and will last a limited amount of time. The time, represented by a lightsaber bar, will decrease faster if the player does negative things such as spawn-camping or killing teammates. The bar will increase if the player kills numerous enemy units or vehicles. Each team gets one Hero at a time, but there can be more than one Hero for each team per match if the Heroes are unlocked more than once. Each Jedi has the ability to use [[Force jump/Legends|Force Jump]] and [[Force speed/Legends|Force speed]]. The [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] characters also each get two of five special techniques. They are [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force Pull]] (Jedi only), Force Push (both), [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force Choke]] (Sith only), [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] (Sith only), [[Telekinesis/Legends|Saber Throw]] (both). Most Jedi and Sith use a three attack combo, the last being the most powerful.\n\nEach faction has a hero that is primarily used more than others. Obi-Wan Kenobi can be used more than any hero in the Republic, Han Solo for the Rebellion, Darth Maul for the Confederacy, and Boba Fett for the Empire\n\nIn ''Hero Assault Mode'', multiple heroes occupy the map.

In addition, there are native creatures that will attack anything that comes across their path. The Jawas on Mos Eisley are an exception, they can create turrets and rebuild ammo and health droids, but mostly will wander around the map to keep doing these things, and despite seeing one with the occasional rifle, they are completely non-aggressive.\n\n{|{{Prettytable}}\n!Name\n!Location\n!Affiliation\n|-\n|[[Acklay/Legends|Acklay]]\n|[[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]] (only in Campaign Mode)\n|Hostile (attacks Republic forces and droid turrets.)\n|-\n|[[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]]\n|[[Endor/Legends|Endor]]\n|[[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]\n|-\n|[[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]]\n|[[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]]\n|Hostile\n|-\n|[[Geonosian/Legends|Geonosian]]\n|[[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]]\n|[[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|CIS]]\n|-\n|[[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]]\n|[[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] (only in Hunt Mode)\n|[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] (only on PSP Challenge)\n|-\n|[[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]]\n|[[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]\n|None (non-aggressive)\n|-\n|[[Rancor/Legends|Rancor]]\n|[[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]]\n|Hostile-Cannot be killed\n|-\n|[[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]]\n|[[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]\n|[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]\n|-\n|[[Wampa/Legends|Wampa]]\n|[[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] (only in Hunt Mode)\n|Hostile\n|-\n|[[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]]\n|[[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] (only in Hunt Mode)\n|Hostile\n|}\n\n==Capital ships==\nIn space combat, each faction will have capital ships. The capital ships (battleships) contain all starfighters and rooms, while the others attack nearby enemies and provide defense/fire support. With the exception of the hangar, the rooms in the battleships have auto-turrets in them that will fire on intruders, though they are not as powerful as the turrets used by the auto-turret bonus. The battleships have a few powerful rapid firing auto-turrets on the outside which can make short work of any type of ship, which a player can also manually control like other turrets, and the shields on the ship make destroying the turrets very difficult. The external turrets will cease firing if the auto-turret defense mainframe inside the ship is destroyed, though the internal turrets will still operate. The shield generator's destruction, also inside the ship, results in the shields outside the battleship being lowered, though sometimes a glitch in the game causes that to not happen, and although just shooting at the battleship will lower the shields, doing so takes considerable time and destroying the shield generator on the inside is much faster. However, the shield generator can be repaired, but it takes some time unless multiple players, playing as the Pilot class, chip in with their Fusioncutters to repair it faster, protecting the external targets for an additional amount of time. Battleships can't be destroyed, but they do have internal and external systems that can be. Outside of the previously mentioned shield generator and auto-turret defense mainframe, there is an externally mounted bridge, life-support systems, communications relay, short-range sensors, and engines. Internally the engine cooling tanks and the life support systems can also be destroyed on the inside. Destroying these, unlike the shields and defense mainframes, does not affect gameplay, but does award whoever destroys them a large sum of points, except in CTF. Internal systems take roughly 2-4 time bombs to destroy. External ones take dozens of bombs at the very least. The other ships are frigates, which cannot be boarded. The number of them that each side has varies from map to map. Unlike battleships, they can be destroyed, but are very durable so it takes time. The frigates have several turrets mounted on them that can make short work of incoming ships, but they won't always fire on a ship depending on how close or how far away they are. Despite their strong weapons, the frigates are very vulnerable to bombers and even a single one can take out a frigate with little difficulty if no fighters intervene. Destroying a frigate gives the same number of points to a side as destroying a system on a ship, except in a CTF match, but even in there it's likely a good idea to have a player destroy the enemy frigates to keep them from shooting their fighters down.\n\nIf the player plays as an interceptor in the Kashyyyk space level then it's possible to fly up to the Droid control ships, Venator class star destroyers and Trade Federation Cruisers in the distance, which are in fact smaller, less realistic models which cause damage when flown into.\n\n===Galactic Republic===\n*Battleship: [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyers]]\n*Frigate: [[Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ship/Legends|''Acclamator''-class assault ships]]\n*Frigate: [[Victory II-class frigate|''Victory II''-class frigate]] (seen only in background)\n\n===Confederacy of Independent Systems===\n*Battleship: [[Providence-class carrier/destroyer/Legends|''Providence''-class carrier/destroyers]]\n*Frigate: [[Munificent-class star frigate/Legends|''Munificent''-class star frigates]]\n*Battleship: [[Lucrehulk-class battleship/Legends|''Lucrehulk''-class battleship]] (seen only in background and as stationary, not-doing-anything object in the Battle of Coruscant space map)\n\n===Galactic Empire===\n*Battleship: [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyers]]\n*Frigate: [[Victory II-class frigate|''Victory II''-class frigates]]\n*Battleship: [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnoughts]] (seen only in background)\n\n===Rebel Alliance===\n*Battleship: [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser/Legends|Mon Calamari Star cruisers]]\n*Frigate: [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR-90 corvettes]]\n*Frigate: [[GR-75 medium transport/Legends|GR-75 medium transport]] (on Hoth and Yavin 4 campaign space battle)\n\n==Functions of Different Starfighters==\nEach faction (Republic, CIS, Rebel, Empire) features four different types of ships:\n\n*Bomber: ([[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter/Legends|V-wing]], [[Belbullab-24 strike bomber|CIS strike bomber]], [[BTL-S3 Y-wing starfighter/Legends|Y-wing]], [[TIE/sa tactical bomber/Legends|TIE bomber]])\n\nBombers are used to take out transports, shields, and ship main systems outside the capital ships. These ships carry high-yield [[Proton bomb/Legends|proton bombs]]. They cannot lock bombs to enemy fighters and have significantly more armor than fighters and interceptors but not more than transports.\n\n*Multi-Purpose Fighter: ([[Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter/Legends|ARC-170 starfighter]], [[Vulture-class starfighter/Legends|''Vulture'' droid starfighter]], [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]], [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter/Legends|TIE fighter]])\n\nFighters are all-purpose ships useful for any situation. These [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] cannot perform specific functions as well as specialized craft. These ships have lock-on torpedoes, and have significantly more armor than interceptors, but not more than bombers and transports.\n\n*Scout Fighter/Interceptor: ([[Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor/Legends|Jedi interceptor]], [[Droid tri-fighter/Legends|Droid tri-fighter]], [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor/Legends|A-wing]], [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE Interceptor]])\n\nInterceptors are high-speed fighters used to dogfight other starfighters. Although these ships can take out starfighters with ease, these are low in power and armor. These ships generally hold cluster missiles and can lock onto targets very quickly.\n\n*Transport: ([[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry/Legends|Republic gunship]], [[HMP droid gunship/Legends|HMP droid gunship]], Alliance Assault Craft (LAAT/i), [[Theta-class T-2c shuttle/Legends|''Theta''-class T-2c shuttle]])\n\nTransports are extremely high in defense, are the slowest and least maneuverable space units. These ships also have multiple positions, up to six, including a main gunner, second gunner, and passengers. Secondary weapons on the ship vary from faction to faction. The troop transports act as spawn points when landed: as long as a transport is manned by at least one pilot, infantry will continue to spawn from the transport. However, they cannot perform evasive maneuvers.\n\n==Planetary vehicles==\nEach faction uses three distinct types of vehicles. These vary in terms of speed, armor, and firepower. These types are :\n\n*Scout ([[74-Z speeder bike/Legends|74-Z speeder bike]], the [[Single Trooper Aerial Platform/Legends|STAP]], and the [[Tauntaun/Legends|Tauntaun]])\n\nSuch vehicles are very fast but have little firepower and armor. The Tauntaun does not have any weapons.\n\n*Medium ([[TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank/Legends|TX-130S tank]], the [[Armored Assault Tank/Legends|AAT]], the [[NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer/Legends|Droid tank]], and the [[AAC-1 speeder tank|Rebel combat landspeeder]])\n\nThis type of vehicles feature medium characteristics, having firepower.\n\n*Heavy vehicles ([[OG-9 homing spider droid|Spider droid]] and the [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]] ).\n\nHeavy transports are massive vehicles that serve as mobile command posts. They possess amazing firepower and armor, but are very slow. They also cannot be sliced by enemy engineers and cannot be destroyed with a single landmine and function as mobile spawning points. These are the [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer/Legends|AT-TE]] for the Republic on Geonosis and Felucia and the [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]] for the Empire on Hoth.\n\nThe vehicles of the factions are ( not all vehicles available at every map ) :\n\n'''[[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]:'''\n*[[Single Trooper Aerial Platform/Legends|STAP]] (Scout vehicle)\n*[[Armored Assault Tank/Legends|AAT]] (Medium vehicle)\n*[[NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer/Legends|Tank Droid]] (Medium vehicle)\n*[[IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank/Legends|''Hailfire'' Droid]] (Medium vehicle)\n*[[OG-9 homing spider droid/Legends|Spider Droid]] (Heavy vehicle)\n\n'''[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]:'''\n*[[BARC speeder/Legends|BARC speeder]] (Scout vehicle)\n*[[TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank/Legends|TX-130S fighter tank]] (Medium vehicle)\n*[[All Terrain Recon Transport/Legends|AT-RT]] (Medium vehicle)\n*[[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer/Legends|AT-TE]] (Heavy Transport)\n\n'''[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]:'''\n*[[74-Z speeder bike/Legends|Speeder Bike]] (Scout vehicle)\n*[[TX-130T fighter tank|''Saber''-class fighter tank]] (Medium vehicle)\n*[[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]] (Heavy vehicle)\n*[[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]] (Heavy Transport)\n\n'''[[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]:'''\n*[[74-Z speeder bike/Legends|Speeder Bike]] (Scout)\n*[[Snowspeeder/Legends|Snowspeeder]] (Spacecraft; characteristics similar to an interceptor)\n*[[Tauntaun/Legends|Tauntaun]] (Scout)\n*[[AAC-1 speeder tank|AAC-1 Hovertank]] (Medium vehicle)\n\n===Critical hit locations===\nAll vehicles have a critical hit point that, when struck with an explosive round, depletes, at the most, 70% of their health. The critical hit point is hard to see and even harder to hit.\n\n*[[AAC-1 speeder tank]]: Black coolant tanks on sides of tank\n*[[TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank/Legends|TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank]] and [[TX-130T fighter tank]]: Circle at rear of tanks\n*[[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer/Legends|AT-TE]]: Cylindrical area along the underbelly\n*[[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]]: Neck between body and head\n*[[Armored Assault Tank/Legends|AAT]]: Rear panel\n*[[NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer/Legends|Droid Tank]]: Rear tread cylinder\n*[[IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank/Legends|''Hailfire'' Droid]]: Cylinders below cockpit\n*[[All Terrain Recon Transport/Legends|AT-RT]]: Cylinder between legs or pilot\n*[[OG-9 homing spider droid/Legends|Homing Spider Droid]]: Where the legs connect to the body on the sides\n*[[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]]: Rear block between legs\n*[[Low Altitude Assault Transport/Legends|LAAT]]/i Gunship: Cockpit\n*[[Theta-class T-2c shuttle/Legends|''Theta''-class shuttle]]: Lower neck\n*[[HMP droid gunship/Legends|Droid Transport]]: Rear panel\n*[[Single Trooper Aerial Platform/Legends|STAP]]: Anywhere\n\nIf players were to hit close to the critical hit location on a vehicle, they would do twice as much damage as a rocket launcher would regularly do (about 25-30%). Locking on to some of these vehicles at a adequate range and radius might lead the rocket to the critical point.\n\n==Battlefronts==\nIn Battlefront II, there are no two maps that take place on the same planet excluding Tatooine and space levels, as this adds more variety to the missions.\n\nThere are 18 land maps and six space maps in instant action (Space Coruscant and Space Mustafar are not in instant action).

Also missing but present on the UMD is an incomplete [[Rhen Var/Legends|Rhen Var]] Citadel map,<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://www.gametoast.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=307468#p307468|text=Forum post|work=Gametoast.com|nobackup=1}}</ref> suggesting that Rhen Var Citadel would have been a PSP exclusive map prior to the Xbox update. Mustafar is also scaled back slightly (it does not include the Control Room or the conference room), although the PSP game's successor, [[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron|''Renegade Squadron'']], uses most of the original Mustafar map.\n\nAlso present in the game is a unique feature during solo Conquest matches, where AI will become a certain map's hero if the player chooses to spawn as a hero.\n\nThe ability to damage capital ships' critical systems from the inside, as well as self-manned turrets, is also missing from the game (although internal critical systems can be seen by running alongside a hangar wall while directing the camera against it). Also, the Training, Space Overview, and Rise of the Empire modes are not available. Instead of the campaign mode there is an alternative challenge mode with three different scenarios.\n\n[[Imperial enforcer]] &ndash; Players will travel to several planets, in which they must hunt down a set number of natives within a time limit. Locations include [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] &ndash; [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]], [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] &ndash; [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]], [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] &ndash; [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] and their final destination will be [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], where they must hunt down fifty Wookiees, they are however allowed one IFT-T. Players begin as a sniper, and their class choices will grow as they venture. Players are aided by Boba Fett.\n\n[[Rogue Assassin]] &ndash; Players are a Phase I Jet Trooper, carrying a clone's blaster rifle instead of an EMP launcher. Rogue Assassins must hunt down and kill specific targets, high ranking officers or deserters, in a time limit, on different planets. Planets include [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]] &ndash; Three Imperial officers, [[Mygeeto/Legends|Mygeeto]] &ndash; Three Imperial officers, [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] &ndash; Six Clone Commanders (two sets of three), [[Polis Massa/Legends|Polis Massa]] &ndash; Six [[IG-100 MagnaGuard/Legends|MagnaGuards]] (Two sets of three). Players only have one class choice, and the heroes are the Fetts(Jango and Boba).\n\n[[Rebel Raider]] &ndash; Players are a Rebel smuggler. They must acquire certain parts within a time limit. Players will travel to [[Mygeeto/Legends|Mygeeto]] to collect three shield generator parts, then to [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] to receive weaponry plans, then to [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] to seek out [[Viper probe droid/Legends|Imperial probe droids]], then in space they must land in the imperial hangar and transport goods back. Players are aided by Han Solo.\n\n==Medals==\nMedals can be acquired for achieving special requirements in one life, however, players must achieve veteran status (Four medals) of that medal before they can use the award that comes with it. Players lose the medal once they die, but if they die within thirty seconds of acquiring the medal, then the award is available to them in the next life. When Elite status (32 medals) is achieved in a certain area, the requirements to earn a medal in that area are lowered (usually by one-fourth), allowing players to gain legendary status more easily. Once legendary status (sixty-four medals) of that medal is achieved players will automatically get the medal once you start the game.\n\nThe ''Endurance'' medal is acquired after twelve points are earned in one life (nine with Elite status). Energy regeneration is awarded, this increases the speed of which the energy bar used for strenuous actions regenerates.\n\nThe ''Guardian'' medal is awarded after twenty-four points are earned in one life (eighteen with Elite status). Damage Reduction is awarded, which makes enemy fire less damaging to the players.\n\nThe ''War Hero'' medal is awarded after thirty-six points are earned in one life (twenty-seven with Elite status). Increased Damage is awarded, which increases the damage players' weapons do.\n\nThe ''Frenzy'' medal is awarded after twelve kills with a Blaster Rifle in one life (nine with Elite status). The Elite Rifle is the award, which offers a more accurate three round burst firing rifle like Boba Fett's with less ammo.\n\nThe ''Demolition'' medal is awarded after four critical hits on vehicle with a Rocket Launcher are gained in one life (three with Elite status). Remote Rockets are the award, these are guided rockets which home in on the target. This is the only award that does not replace the previous weapon.\n\nThe ''Gunslinger'' medal is awarded after six kills with a Pistol in one life (four with Elite status). A Precision Pistol with greater damage, accuracy, faster rate of fire, and limited ammo is awarded.\n\nThe ''Marksman'' medal is awarded after six head shots with sniper rifle are gained in one life (four with Elite status). The Beam Rifle is the award, which offers a beam that can pass through multiple enemies.\n\nThe ''Regulator'' medal is awarded after eight kills with a Blast Cannon/Shotgun are gained in one life (six with Elite status). The award is a Flechette Shotgun, which is a more powerful shotgun, with more ammo than the regular shotgun.\n\nThe ''Technician'' medal is awarded to players who manage to slice into a vehicle. The Vehicle Regeneration award is given which slowly regenerates the health of the vehicle the player drives next.\n\nThe more medals they player has earned, the more men can be lead: If twenty medals are earned, players obtain the rank of sergeant and can lead two men; if one hundred are earned, players obtain the rank of captain and can lead three men; and if three hundred medals are earned, players obtain the rank of general and can lead four men.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Bob Bergen]]&mdash;Luke Skywalker\n*[[Christina Rumbley]]&mdash;Female Alliance Infantry\n*[[Corey Burton]]&mdash;Count Dooku; Imperial Officer 2; Ki Adi Mundi\n*[[Dave Boat]]&mdash;Republic Infantry\n*[[David W.

The download includes:\n\n===New heroes===\n*[[Kit Fisto/Legends|Kit Fisto]]: A Republic hero who is stronger and more bulky than most of the other heroes. His powers include [[Telekinesis/Legends|Saber Throw]], [[Force Orb/Legends|Force Water Orb]] and Force Destruction.\n\n*[[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]]: A villainess who has [[Interlocking hilt|fiber-cord linked lightsabers]] and is the CIS answer to [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]]. Her powers are [[Starblade]]s and [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force Push]].\n\n*[[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]: While not actually a new hero, Anakin can be played on the Republic for the first time outside of the campaign. This Anakin is before his descent to the dark side and can only be played on the Yavin 4 Arena map. He has all the same abilities as the Imperial Anakin.\n\n===New levels===\n*[[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]: [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]]\n*[[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]: [[Massassi Arena|Arena]]\n*[[Rhen Var/Legends|Rhen Var]]: [[Rhen Var Harbor|Harbor]]\n*Rhen Var: [[Rhen Var Citadel|Citadel]]\n[[File:Asajj_bf2promo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]] in Battlefront II.]]\n'''NOTE:''' These maps are from [[Star Wars: Battlefront|the first game]] and, along with the Kashyyyk: Beachhead map, can be played in Hero Assault mode.\n\n===New modes===\n*Rhen Var: Harbor &ndash; Wampa Hunt\nWampas (claws) vs. Rebels (All Types)\n\n==Mod tools==\nOn February 15, 2006 a 1.1 patch was released for the PC version, which included support for additional maps. The modding tools were subsequently released by [[LucasArts]] and [[Pandemic Studios]] on February 22, and shipped with nearly everything used to make the game, including the mission files, special effects, fonts, and localizations, unlike its predecessor, [[Star Wars: Battlefront#Mod tools|BFBuilder]], for the original ''Battlefront'' game. Sound effects and music used to make the game were not included because of copyright issues,<ref>[[Star Wars: Battlefront#Mod tools|BFBuilder]] ReadMe</ref> although it is possible to import original music and sound effects into the game.\n\nMap editing in BFBuilder is handled by a program called ZeroEdit, which is used to mold the landscapes, place objects, command posts and vehicle spawn points. Additional scripting is done through LUA files for maps, and ODF (Object Definition Files) files for objects. User-created levels and mods then go through a process called munging, which compiles assets and maps into formats readable by the game, which are then compiled into container files for in-game use. Although the ''Battlefront II'' mod tools are subtly different from BFBuilder, assets can be imported from the first into the second, and vice versa.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{IncompleteApp}}\n{{App\n|characters=\n*[[Apailana/Legends|Apailana]]\n*[[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]\n*[[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]]\n*[[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba

Archives/Legends|Jedi Archives]] (these are the same diagrams that were seen in the ''[[Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones]]'' reference book). Also, the shortcut into [[Theed Royal Palace/Legends|Theed Royal Palace]] from ''Episode I'' can be seen.\n*Because Hero Assault Mode is meant mainly to be a \"party mode\", different songs, such as [[Jedi Rocks/Legends|Jedi Rocks]], [[Lapti Nek/Legends|Lapti Nek]], [[Ewok Celebration|Yub Nub]], and both [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Mos Eisley cantina]] [[Jizz/Legends|songs]] play in the background.\n*Although [[Temuera Morrison]] voiced Jango Fett, Boba Fett, and the retired clone trooper, he did not voice the clone troopers in-game.\n*[[Matthew Wood]], who provided the voice of [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] in [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], also voiced the infamous cyborg general in the video game.\n*''Star Wars: Battlefront II'' is the top selling Star Wars video game, with over 6,000,000 copies sold.\n*In the PSP version of the game, during the Rebel Raider challenge on Hoth, the Empire controls the remaining Rebel Transport and the Destroyed Shield Generator, while the player controls the Imperial [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base]], although players play as the Rebels.\n*Through modding, it has been discovered that more campaigns were to be in the game, such as a space battle between the Empire and Anti-Troopers, and even had their own lines for the cutscenes, but were taken out for unknown reasons.\n*It has also been discovered that the cutscenes of the game were to have additional lines, but were also taken out for unknown reasons.\n*During Galactic Civil War Battles, Imperials sometimes whistle [[The Imperial March]] and&mdash;though rarely&mdash;may swear during prolonged periods of heated battle, such as this [https://youtu.be/km_j1Wrv_Wg?t=1m20s Mustafar battle].\n*During the Naboo Campaign, when the player's objective is to eliminate all of the Jedi, if the player kills a Naboo royal guard, a glitch may occure where it will be counted as a team kill and take away points. However, this glitch is extremely rare.\n*When a [[B2-series super battle droid/Legends|B2 super battle droid]] is blown apart, the flying parts are those of a [[B1-series battle droid/Legends|B1]]. It is possible that this mistake was a scripting error or simply a choice made by developers to increase the game's efficiency through the use of fewer models and/or files.\n*The instruction manual incorrectly states that the sniper class uses recon droids. In truth, only specific unlockable classes (specifically, the [[IG-100 MagnaGuard/Legends|IG-100 MagnaGuard]], [[Clone trooper commander#Behind the scenes|Clone Commander]], Imperial Officer and [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] Warrior)have the recon droid in their secondary inventory. This typo may be due to the fact that the sniper class of the original [[Star Wars: Battlefront]] ''were'' equipped with recon droids. Recon droids may have been carried by the sniper class in an earlier version of the game, but may have been switched with auto-turrets to correct balancing issues.\n*In the intro to the Space Coruscant campaign, the Republic's Hangar Shields are red, when they should be blue.\n*In both the Kashyyyk and Mygeeto intro videos, a B1 Droid with blue markings is seen. This may be because in the original game, Assault Droids were blue instead of red.\n*In several cutscenes for the Empire campaign, such as Naboo and Kamino, an Imperial Engineer from Hoth is seen, despite there not being any in those levels.\n*Aboard the [[Tantive IV/Legends|Tantive IV]], the screens in the control room show the view of Kamino Obi-Wan saw in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]. This is somewhat confusing as there is no [[canon]]ical mention of the [[Tantive IV/Legends|Tantive IV]] ever visiting [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]], and the in-game battle appears to be the same action conducted by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Vader]] and the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] during the opening scenes of ''A New Hope'', thus placing the ship above [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].\n*Also on the [[Tantive IV/Legends|Tantive IV]], the main view shows elongated stars, even though the ship is actually in the hangar bay of an Imperial [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]].\n*On the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] map, a destructable vent in a hallway on the prison level leads to the [[Garbage compactor/Legends|trash compactor]] seen in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]. The walls of the trash compactor close in and kill the player.\n*[[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter/Legends|TIE fighters]] can be seen in the Death Star hangar even during the \"Clone Wars\"-era Death Star battle. The [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]-era battle onboard the Death Star is non-canon, as the Death Star was not completed until years after the end of the Clone Wars.\n*Darth Maul is a playable hero on some Clone Wars-era maps such as Yavin IV and Mustafar, even though he was defeated at least a decade prior to most battles in the game, none of which have him after he reappeared. The clones may say, \"''Darth Maul? What's he going to do? Bleed all over us?''\" when he is first summoned to the field. Obviously, his appearance is non-canon, due to his natural legs still being attached to his body.\n*Occasionally, a clone will say \"''Look out! It's Major Malevolent, uh, General Grievous!''\" when the player is playing as General Grievous.\n*If Jango Fett enters the battlefield, clone troopers can occasionally be heard shouting \"''Fett's here. And he brought his head!''\". This is a reference to Episode II where Jango Fett is beheaded by Mace Windu; needless to say, his role in Battlefront II's Clone Wars-era battles is non-canonical.\n*There is also a possibility that a clone will tell Jango \"Hey, Jango! Can I have your autograph?\" This was obviously placed in there as a comical line, considering many clones didn't think highly of their Separatist-allied template.\n*One of the load screens for the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star: Interior]] map is an obvious screenshot from an earlier version of the game, as the command posts are colored green, while in the final version of the game, friendly command posts are blue. Other loading screens for the game's maps--i.e. the Tantive IV--are similarly taken from the original [[Star Wars: Battlefront|Battlefront]], as they show either older CP color schemes or older character skins.\n*One of the load screens for the [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]] map has [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]] with a blue and purple lightsaber, even on the non-PSP versions of the game. At the Republic ending of the Galactic Conquest, Aayla has her purple lightsaber and a green command post can be seen in the background, possibly meaning that Aayla originally had a purple lightsaber in all versions of the game.\n*In the intro to the Space Kashyyyk campaign, a Clone Pilot is seen falling in space. This can be achieved by taking off and landing quickly on the edge of the hangar and exiting an aircraft, and walking off the ship and into space, although there is gravity and the player will fall instead of being slowly dragged toward the planet.\n*The Hunt mode for [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] has the Wooden Barricades and Gate Wench for the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee's]] team as the opposite team's structures. This is clearly a glitch and can be annoying if the player is playing as the Wookiees, as they will attack and destroy their own defenses.\n*The heroes Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi have the same lightsaber attack combos, as do Luke Skywalker and Ki-Adi-Mundi (though the latter pair have different dash attacks and Force skills). Also, both pairs play on the same planet during conquest modes (Mustafar and Mygeeto, respectively).\n*On the Death Star map, when playing as Darth Sidious in the Clone Wars era, the clones can be heard shouting things such as \"Surround Palpatine!\" - yet another non-canonical quote by Republic infantry. In reality, the entire clone army was truly under the command of Darth Sidious himself for the duration of the Clone Wars.\n*On [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], [[Vulture-class starfighter/Legends|Vulture Droid]] Starfighters can be in the sky, although faintly.\n*In [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba's]] [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|palace]], if an AI is picked up by the [[Rancor/Legends|Rancor]], that character will spew health and ammo packs when shot. This also happens in Battlefront I with the [[Sarlacc/Legends|Sarlacc]].\n*There is a glitch with the Award Pistol concerning [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. After this award is earned with the 'Legendary' status, if the player chooses to play as [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] in any map (including [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] Assault), if the player switches to the [[Fusioncutter/Legends|Fusioncutter]], the player will be unable to switch back to the pistol unless they respawn.\n**A similar glitch occurs with the Anti-Trooper in the PSP version of the game - if the player earns Frenzy or Guardian awards, the player will not be able to use the award weapon or the original weapon without respawning.\n*On space maps, if the player lands a starfighter just before it exits or enters a battleship's hangar shield and exits the fighter, it becomes possible to walk around the outer edges of the ship. On certain levels, it is possible to jump down on top of nearby frigates.\n*When playing as The Emperor, the lightsaber is deactivated and hidden unless you press the attack key. When he is finished executing his attack combo, he puts it away again (if you continue to press the attack key, he still puts it away, then immediately takes it out again).\n*When playing as [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]], if the attack button is held down near the end of the attack sequence, he will do an extra twirl of his double-bladed lightsaber. This is an additional attack that will still harm enemies.\n*When playing as the Republic on [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]] in Galactic Conquest, the [[Clone trooper/Legends|clones]] still have [[Phase I clone trooper armor/Legends|Phase I]] Armor.\n*Jango Fett carries one Precision Pistol (the award pistol) instead of two [[WESTAR-34 blaster pistol/Legends|WESTAR-34 blaster pistols]].\n*Characters can enter the [[Vulture-class starfighter/Legends|vulture droid]] and almost all other CIS spaceships as a vehicle; when flying in space, the droid computer's voice will sound at various points even if the pilot is an organic.\n*In the PC instruction manual, on page 13, it shows a picture of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] in his [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] outfit from Episode IV (Luke's Tatooine farmer attire), even though you cannot play as Luke in that outfit in the game.\n*During the deactivation of Xbox LIVE for all Xbox Original games, ''Star Wars: Battlefront II'' was recognized for having the second largest online community still playing the game prior to the online multiplayer deactivation on April 15, 2010 with the largest being the online community for ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_2 Halo 2]''.\n*In the mission, ''Amongst the Ruins'', LAAT dropships are actively used during the battle. However, the models used in the level are the variations for the first ''Battlefront'' which use different weapons from their Space Battle counterparts. In addition, ''Amongst the Ruins'', ''Underground Ambush'', and ''Operation: Knightfall'' are the only missions to utilize ''Battlefront I'' variations of airborne vehicles (which have controls and movements that are scripted to an AI and cannot be commandeered).\n*In the game, the retired clone trooper narrating the campaign encounters every battle from Geonosis to Hoth. However, due to the shortened lifespan of Fett clones, first-generation or especially Spaarti, the last battle this trooper would've encountered, at best, would probably have been the battle of Naboo, as the entire campaign was spread over a period of roughly 25 years. This means the trooper would've been over 90 human years old due to accelerated aging and still fighting, something impossible. This is also referenced at times when the trooper says things like \"20 years after we were created\" before the clone rebellion on Kamino and \"I'd fought with some of those men for over 20 years\" before the space battle of Yavin. This implies that perhaps some of the troopers of the 501st were given something to prevent accelerated aging and therefore were able to fight in such historic battles as Hoth. This is supported by the fact that other Fett clones appear in the Expanded Universe, some of them years after the Battle of Endor.\n*When playing as [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], players will notice that he holds his [[Lightsaber/Legends|Lightsaber]] in his right hand. However, when using the dash attack, the strike places the lightsaber in the left hand. This is a glitch as there is no transition of the lightsaber between hands.\n*When playing on [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]], small pockets in the earth seep toxic red gas. The gas will slowly deteriorate an organic's health, while droids go unharmed.\n*When playing as Han Solo, stormtroopers will say things like \"Dirty Smuggler\" or \"It's Han Solo, and he's shooting first! That's not fair!\"\n*In the game, Aayla Secura uses two lightsabers at once in battle, one blue, and one green (purple in the PSP version). However, in other Star Wars material such as \"The Clone Wars.\" and comic books, she is only seen using one blue lightsaber.\n*''[[Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection]]'' adds Hero Assault to all ground-based maps, including Jabba's Palace. Unlike other maps that omit the native species in this mode, the Gamorreans guarding the palace are retained and treated as a separate faction from the playable ones. They will attack both hero and villain indiscriminately, including bounty hunters Jango and Boba Fett, the latter of which Jabba is a regular client of.\n\n===Differences between the trailer and final game===\n*In the Trailer for Star Wars: Battlefront II, there's a clip where a [[Battle droid/Legends|Battle droid]] is sniping a [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] in the Great Grass Plains, and also a Rebel Vanguard with a Battlefront I Skin on the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]]. The HUD in these scenes are identical to Battlefront I's HUD. It is possible that this was showing an early version of the [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] Hunt mode.\n*In the trailer, the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|Millennium Falcon]] is seen in a [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] hangar bay. This scene is not seen in the final version of the game.\n*In the trailer, the [[Jedi Temple/Legends|Jedi Temple]] is shown during daytime.\n*The layouts of the hangars of the capital ships are different in the trailer.\n*A different layout for [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]] was shown in in the trailer. This layout was also shown in in-game movies.\n*Ships appeared to be pilotable on planet surface maps in the trailer; however this feature was removed from the final game with the exception of rebel speeders in the [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] level.\n*The Republic Cruiser in the trailer looks completely different from the game.\n*The voices of the Rebels and Imperials are the same in the trailer as the first ''Battlefront''.\n*The layouts of many maps were changed between the release of the trailer and the final game.\n*Space battles appeared to have more capital ships than the final game, with different layouts for the battles.\n*The trailer shows the beta [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]] map shown in trailers for the original ''Star Wars: Battlefront''.\n*The interior design of the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] hangars in the trailer were designed to resemble the Death Star hangars. However, in the final game, the Star Destroyer hangars were remodeled.\n*The clone trooper in the Mustafar scene uses a different reloading sound effect from the one used in the final version of the game.\n*In one of the Kamino scenes, the sound effect for a firing Commando Pistol was used for a Clone Blaster Rifle.\n\n===Cut content===\nThe game has content that was cut but included either with the mod tools or indicated in the game's files:\n\n*Voice-overs for two additional heroes, the [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Emperor's Royal Guard]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Ben Kenobi]].\n*Voice-overs for units using weapons they did not have in the final game, such as the Rebel Marksman dispensing ammo packs or fusion cutters.\n*A second Imperial Officer model wearing its standard-issue uniforms.\n*An Imperial Officer set up to use in a hunt mode.\n*Acklay were supposed to appear as natives on the Conquest version of Felucia.\n*Dialogue for cross-era modes, such as Republic versus the Empire.\n*[[Infantry Support Platform/Legends|Infantry Support Platforms]] were meant to appear in the game.\n*Starfighters forming squadrons was an unfinished and uncompleted feature.\n\n==Sources==\n{{ScrollBox|\n*[[Star Wars Insider 85|''Star Wars Insider'' 85]]\n*{{CargoBay|url=item-detail/18181|text=Battlefront II PS2}}\n*{{CargoBay|url=item-detail/18182|text=Battlefront II PC}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/news20050518.html|text=Battlefront II for PSP and other E3 News}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/f20050923/index.html|text=''Star Wars'' Battlefront II Features the 501st}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/news20050928b.html|text=MTV Premieres ''Star Wars'' Battlefront II Trailer}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/bf2_trailer.html|text=''Star Wars'' Battlefront II Trailer}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/f20051013/index.html|text=Developers Talk ''Star Wars'' Battlefront II}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/f20051021/index.html|text=More ''Star Wars'' Fantasy Fulfillment in ''Battlefront II''}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/news20051219.html|text=''Battlefront II'' Bonus Content and Downloadable Expansion}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/news20060127.html|text=Xbox Live ''Battlefront II'' Expansion Pack Coming Jan 31}}\n*{{InsiderCite|110|Voice of the Force}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=games/videogames/news20090706news.html|text=LucasArts Revives Classic Gaming Titles}}\n*{{InsiderCite|152|The Rebel Bruiser}}\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-force-for-change-announces-new-star-wars-humble-bundle-iii-to-benefit-unicef|text=''Star Wars: Force for Change'' Announces New ''Star Wars'' Humble Bundle III to Benefit UNICEF}}\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-day-2023-fan-spotlight|text=Fan Spotlight: \"What Does ''Star Wars'' Mean to You?\"}}\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection|text=''Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection'' Available Now &ndash; Updated}}\n}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{LucasArtsCite|url=games/swbattlefrontii/indexFlash.html|text=Battlefront II}} {{C|Flash required}}\n*{{WebCite|url=http://pandemicstudios.com/corp/proj_swb2.php|text=Star Wars Battlefront II|work=pandemicstudios.com|archivedate=20080608071142|nolive=1}}\n*{{EA|subdomain=www.japan|url=swbf2/indexFlash.html|text=\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\u3000\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8II (translation: Star Wars Battlefront II)|nolive=1}} {{C|Flash required}}\n*{{WP|Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)}}\n*{{Interwiki|swgames|Star Wars Games Wiki|Star Wars: Battlefront II}}\n*{{MobyGames|url=game/21218/star-wars-battlefront-ii|text=Star Wars: Battlefront II}}\n\n{{Battlefront}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|bg=Star Wars Battlefront II\n|cs=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|de=Battlefront II#legends\n|es=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|fi=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|fr=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|it=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|ka=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|nl=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|pl=Battlefront II\n|pt=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|sv=Star Wars: Battlefront II\n|zh=\u661f\u7403\u5927\u6218\uff1a\u524d\u7ebfII\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battlefront II}}\n[[Category:Battlefront series]]\n[[Category:Clone Wars multimedia project]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:Legends computer games]]\n[[Category:Legends console video games]]\n[[Category:LucasArts games]]\n[[Category:Third-person shooters]]",

Battlefront II, however, includes elements and missions from Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, as well as enhanced aspects of gameplay including space combat and the ability to play as \"heroes\", certain iconic Light Side/Dark Side characters from the Star Wars franchise, which previously only appeared as AI-controlled NPCs.\nThe games campaign mode is entitled Rise of the Empire. The story takes the player on different missions throughout the galaxy as part of the Galactic Empires 501st Legion, also known as Vader's Fist, form the perspective of a clone trooper veteran.\nOther game modes include \"Instant Action\" where the player can fight on any battleground, land or space, and \"Galactic Conquest\" where the player fights as a certain faction for control of the galaxy.\nThe game was released on November 1, 2005, for the PC, Mobile phone, Xbox, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 2, the same day that Revenge of the Sith was released on DVD.\nThe first game and Battlefront II were re-released on March 14, 2024 as the Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection.\n\n\u2022 New Features\n\n\u2022 Improved single-player experience that includes improved AI enemies and allies. A greater emphasis is also placed on storytelling through open-ended mission-based objectives.\n\n\u2022 Revamped Galactic Conquest mode that plays out on a galactic scale.\n\n\u2022 New space battles that allows the player to dogfight in X-wings, TIE Fighters, Jedi interceptors, Y-Wings, and several other starfighters. Players are also able to board capital ships and engage in combat with other enemies in different sections of the ships.\n\n\u2022 More than 12 new battlefields on land and in space, including many from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith such as Utapau, Felucia and Mustafar. Also included are all-new classic trilogy locations including the Death Star interior, and Tantive IV. However, some of the original battlefronts from the first game, such as Rhen Var, have been removed.\n\n\u2022 Special opportunities throughout the game for players to wield a lightsaber and use their favorite Force powers as Jedi and Sith characters depending on the battlefront.\n\n\u2022 Three new classes: Engineer (Land) and Marine (Space). Engineer replaces the Pilot on land as the Pilot is now the primary Space Class. The third is a special \"officer\" that varies depending on the player's faction. For example, the Republic forces can choose to become Clone Commanders, while players siding with the CIS can make use of IG-100 MagnaGuards.\n\n\u2022 Online multiplayer action for up to 24 players on PS2, up to 32 on Xbox or up to 64 on Windows (plus AI units).\n\n\u2022 Wi-Fi (wireless) compatible, up to four players wireless multiplayer (PSP).\n\n\u2022 Engineer/Pilot units can hijack enemy vehicles by using their fusioncutters to rip open hatches and pull the enemy outside before climbing in and stealing the vehicle.\n\n\u2022 Players will be able to change the reinforcement count in Instant Action from 150 for quick skirmishes up to 750 per team for epic battles.\n\n\u2022 New and better GUI for better gameplay.\n\n\u2022 New Instant Action Modes: Hunt, Capture the Flag, XL (PC only) and Hero Assault, where players can fight it out as every hero and villain in the game.\n\n\u2022 Players can change their character at any friendly Command Post.\n\n\u2022 Players can earn awards with units. For example, any unit can obtain the \"Endurance\", \"Guardian\", and \"War Hero\" awards, but only Snipers can earn \"Marksman\", only Engineers can earn \"Regulator\", and only Soldiers and Marines can earn \"Frenzy\".\n\n\u2022 Players may now \"Sprint\", running faster than usual, making getting around the battlefront easier.\n\n\u2022 Training\n\nThe game contains an optional training mission on Geonosis. This mission takes the player around a battlefield and teaches them all of the various methods of fighting a battle. The mission consists of the following tasks:\n\u2022 Reach a specific point on the map.\n\n\u2022 Eliminate three droid scouts, all B2 super battle droids.\n\n\u2022 Destroy a damaged Hailfire droid.\n\n\u2022 Capture a command post next to a downed Techno Union ship.\n\n\u2022 Repair two droids, one for health and the other for ammunition.\n\n\u2022 Destroy a spider droid with an All Terrain Tactical Enforcer.\n\n\u2022 Seize a holocron dropped by a dead Geonosian.\n\n\u2022 Capture a command post at the top of a mountain.\n\n\u2022 Use a sniper rifle to eliminate three more droids.\n\n\u2022 Destroy a spider droid with a rocket launcher.\n\n\u2022 Eliminate ten enemies as Mace Windu.\n\n\u2022 Take over the CIS main bunker.\n\nThe 501st Legion was not created until after the Battle of Geonosis, but a clone trooper who would later become a member of the 501st compiled this journal entry:\nMy first day as a member of the 501st... it was hot, sandy, chaotic. Nothing at all like the simulations on Kamino. Of course that's pretty much the way it was for all of us, wasn't it? All that breeding, all those years of training, it doesn't really prepare you for the all the screaming, or the blood, does it? Frankly I'm amazed we ever made it past the first hour, never mind the first day.\nIncredibly, the 501st survived the crucible of Geonosis, emerging battle-hardened, and ready for whatever the war would throw at us.\n\n\u2022 Campaign mode\n\nIn Campaign Mode, the player follows the campaigns of the 501st Legion as told through the 501st Journal. As players progress through the game, they play as a clone trooper during the reign of the Republic and as a stormtrooper during the reign of the Empire.\nThe action brings players to multiple planets through a story arc that stretches from the dawn of the Clone Wars to the formation of the Empire and later, bridging the gap between Episodes III and IV.\nUnlike the first Battlefront, Battlefront IIs campaign gives players certain objectives with a given number of reinforcements with the enemys reinforcements unlimited and an occasional time limit rather than playing an ordinary conquest match. The game also gives the option to skip space missions.\n\n\u2022 Republic Missions\n\n(22 \u2013 19 BBY - The Clone Wars)\n\u2022 Part 1: Geonosis&mdash;Attack of the Clones Training, Optional\n\n\u2022 Part 2: Mygeeto&mdash;Amongst the Ruins\n\n\u2022 Part 3: Coruscant Space&mdash;A Desperate Rescue Optional\n\n\u2022 Part 4: Felucia&mdash;Heart of Darkness\n\n\u2022 Part 5: Kashyyyk Space&mdash;First Line of Defense Optional\n\n\u2022 Part 6: Kashyyyk&mdash;A Line in the Sand\n\n\u2022 Part 7: Utapau&mdash;Underground Ambush\n\n\u2022 Part 8: Coruscant&mdash;Operation: Knightfall\n\n\u2022 Empire Missions\n\n(18 BBY \u2013 3 ABY - Imperial Era/Galactic Civil War)\n\u2022 Part 1: Naboo&mdash;Imperial Diplomacy\n\n\u2022 Part 2: Mustafar Space&mdash;Preventive Measures Optional\n\n\u2022 Part 3: Mustafar&mdash;Tying up Loose Ends\n\n\u2022 Part 4: Kamino&mdash;Changing of the Guard\n\n\u2022 Part 5: Death Star&mdash;Prison Break\n\n\u2022 Part 6: Polis Massa&mdash;Birth of the Rebellion\n\n\u2022 Part 7: Tantive IV&mdash;Recovering the Plans\n\n\u2022 Part 8: Yavin 4 Space&mdash;Vader's Fist Strikes Back Optional\n\n\u2022 Part 9: Yavin 4&mdash;Revenge of the Empire\n\n\u2022 Part 10: Hoth&mdash;Our Finest Hour\n\n\u2022 Cross-era story missions\n\nSee also: Operation: Knightfall\n\u2022 This mission puts the player on the side of the Republic during Operation: Knightfall. The clone troopers fight alongside Darth Vader against Jedi Temple Security Guards and Jedi. Because the mission is told from the perspective of the clone troopers, the Temple Guardians and Jedi in this mission are set as Rebels.\n\n\u2022 This mission shows a raid on Naboo's capital city, Theed, where Queen Apailana is hiding a group of surviving Jedi she has made her personal bodyguards. The Empire fights the Royal Naboo Security Forces on the streets of Theed. Like with Operation: Knightfall, this sees the RNSF and Jedi as Rebels, especially considering the RNSF use Rebel AAC-1 speeder tanks.\n\n\u2022 The missions Preventive Measures and Tying up Loose Ends show the skirmish between the Empire and CIS forces in space around Mustafar and on the planet's surface. In these two missions, a rogue Geonosian engineer by the name of Gizor Dellso has reactivated the hidden droid factory on Mustafar. The 501st must first eliminate space defenses, then land on the planet and assault the factory, eliminating Dellso before he can reignite the Clone Wars.\n\n\u2022 The mission Changing of the Guard pits the Empire against rogue clone troopers. The Prime Minister of Kamino has been secretly growing a new Clone Army, bred to take up arms against the Empire. Darth Vader hires Boba Fett for his knowledge of the inner workings of the clone facility and sends the 501st to Kamino to destroy the cloning facility with Boba's help due to his time spent there when he was younger with his father, Jango.\n\n\u2022 The Anti-Troopers the Empire fights are clones with the palette of heavy troopers and jet troopers with blaster/sniper rifles and are set as \"Republic\".\n\n\u2022 Bosses\n\nCertain levels of the campaign require the elimination of an important person or persons in order to win the battle.\n\u2022 Utapau&mdash;General Grievous\n\n\u2022 Jedi Temple&mdash;Three Jedi Masters\n\n\u2022 Naboo&mdash;Queen Apailana\n\n\u2022 Mustafar&mdash;Gizor Dellso\n\n\u2022 Death Star&mdash;Rebel Jedi Padawan\n\n\u2022 Tantive IV&mdash;Princess Leia Organa\n\n\u2022 Yavin 4&mdash;Bothan High Command\n\n\u2022 Galactic Conquest\n\nThe Galactic Conquest mode in Star Wars: Battlefront II has been completely revamped. In this new mode, players build and maintain fleets and try to achieve galactic dominance by conquering enemy worlds. A map of the galaxy shows planets controlled by the player, enemy-controlled planets, and pockets of empty space. Since there is only one map per planet (except Tatooine, even though Jabba's Palace is not in this mode) Planets can only be controlled by one side or the other, unlike the first game, where planets could be neutral.\n\n\u2022 Play\n\nTo attack a hostile planet, the player moves their fleet to the enemy planet. If an enemy capital ship is in orbit around the planet, the battle begins in space; otherwise a skirmish begins on the surface. A space battle also ensues if two enemy fleets meet in empty space.\nIn space battles, the losing faction loses their fleet. If the victor is attacking a hostile planet, a ground battle begins directly after the victory.\nAt the end of the battle, a summary shows what has occurred and displays how many credits were earned in the battle. The credit values for winning and losing vary based on the planet conquered as well as the number of planets already controlled by the faction.\nEach faction begins with one fleet. The cost to build more fleets depends on the number of fleets already in play. For example, Team 1 owns one fleet and wants to purchase another for 1000 credits. Team 1 then wishes to buy another fleet, which costs 2000 credits.\nThe game ends when one side loses all of their planets and fleets.\n\n\u2022 Class Purchases\n\nEach faction begins with the basic trooper for land battles and the pilot for space battles. They also begin with 1000 credits. At the beginning of any turn, the player has the option to purchase another class. The costs vary based on the class.\n\n\u2022 List of Classes and their Cost\n\n\u2022 Infantry: Free\n\n\u2022 Heavy Weapons: 1000\n\n\u2022 Sniper: 1000\n\n\u2022 Engineer:1000\n\n\u2022 Special 1: 1800\n\n\u2022 Special 2: 1800\n\n\u2022 Pilot: Free (Space Only)\n\n\u2022 Marine: 800 (Space Only)\n\n\u2022 Bonuses\n\nThe bonuses return from the first game, although more strategy is involved. Instead of controlling the planets to gain these bonuses, the player must purchase them at the beginning of their turn. These bonuses can be used to aid their forces, protect command posts, or harm enemy units. However, once the bonus has been used it will need to be bought again. A player can have a maximum of 3 bonuses at a time.\n\n\u2022 List of Bonuses\n\n\u2022 Energy Boost: Causes the players units energy gauge to replenish faster after being depleted (200 credits)\n\n\u2022 Supplies: Increases amount of ammunition and other supplies the player's units can carry (200)\n\n\u2022 Reinforced Garrison: Adds extra troops to the player's reinforcement bank if it drops too low (200)\n\n\u2022 Auto Turrets: Automatically reinforces the player's command posts with defense grid turrets (400)\n\n\u2022 Bacta Tanks: Causes the health of all the player's units to automatically regenerate at a constant rate (400)\n\n\u2022 Combat Shielding: Gives the player's units an extra reserve of health upon entering the battlefield (400)\n\n\u2022 Sabotage: Causes all enemy vehicles to suffer damage upon spawning in (600)\n\n\u2022 Enhanced Blasters: Amplifies the damage of all blaster-type weapons for the player's team (600)\n\n\u2022 Leader: Activates the players factions playable hero for planetary battles (800)\n\n\u2022 Scenarios\n\nThere are four different starting scenarios. If the player takes the enemy's base planet (bolded in the following list), he/she obtains twice the number of credits than normal, and that planet is permanently removed from gameplay.\n\u2022 Birth of the Rebellion: Hoth, Dagobah, Yavin 4\n\n\u2022 Republic Sovereignty: Kamino, Naboo, Coruscant\n\n\u2022 Dark Reign of the Empire: Endor, Coruscant, Mustafar\n\n\u2022 The Confederate Uprising: Geonosis, Utapau, Mustafar\n\n\u2022 Endings\n\n\u2022 Birth of the Rebellion\n\nStates that the Rebellion has liberated the galaxy, ends with Darth Sidious being thrown into the Death Star II reactor and the liberation of planets as Luke Skywalker rebuilds the Jedi Order on Coruscant. A celebration with fireworks is held on Endor, Naboo, and Tatooine. Heroes of Yavin are seen reunited. \"A New Hope and End Credits\" is played. (Note: This is the only canon ending to a scenario due to the events of the Original Trilogy.)\n\n\u2022 Republic Sovereignty\n\nStates that the Republic has reclaimed the galaxy, ends with the defeat of General Grievous at Utapau, and Darth Sidious is killed by Mace Windu. Anakin Skywalker becomes a Jedi Master. Ki-Adi-Mundi, Aayla Secura, Plo Koon and Stass Allie are not killed by their troops, as Order 66 never occurred. The clones remain loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Order. Galactic Civil War never occurs, and Anakin does not become Darth Vader. \"Anakin vs. Obi-Wan\" (a variation of the \"Battle of the Heroes\") is played.\n\n\u2022 Dark Reign of the Empire\n\nStates that the Empire has conquered the galaxy, Boba Fett captures Han Solo and leaves him encased in carbonite at Jabbas Palace. Darth Vader captures Princess Leia and is seen Force choking her on the Tantive IV. The Imperials push back the Rebel forces on Endor and defeat them in a space battle as well. Luke surrenders, and is shown bowing down to Palpatine on the Death Star II. The Emperor and Darth Vader rule the Galaxy. \"The Imperial March\" plays.\n\n\u2022 The Confederate Uprising\n\nStates that the CIS has conquered the galaxy, ends with the Droid Army annihilating Republic forces. Then they lead an attack on the Jedi Temple with Darth Sidious as their leader. Anakin and Count Dooku are shown dueling on Mustafar. Dooku kills Anakin on a bridge above a lava reservoir. Darth Maul and Jango Fett are show to be alive and well, battling the Republic on various planets. General Grievous hunts down and kills the remaining Jedi. \"Duel of the Fates\" plays.\n\n\u2022 New modes\n\nIn addition to the single player storyline, Galactic Conquest, and both single- and multiplayer Instant Action, Battlefront II has several new game modes &ndash; Hunt, Capture the Flag, Hero Assault, and XL, a PC-only single player mode. There is also a glitch on the PS2 and PC versions of the game: when zooming in between Mustafar and Endor and pressing pause, two extra modes appear: Team Deathmach and Team CP. However, both are unplayable without modding the game.\n\n\u2022 Hunt Mode\n\nHunt mode operates much like Assault mode. An army of indigenous forces (e.g., Wampas) and a faction (e.g., Rebel Alliance), fight each other to reach a set number of points first. This mode is somewhat unbalanced, as some forces are stronger than others; for example, the Endor scenario pits rock-wielding Ewoks against the scout trooper. The Ewoks are technically more powerful due to the scout trooper's role in the game as sniper infantry.\n\n\u2022 Hunt Mode Scenarios\n\n\u2022 Endor: Ewoks (sharp rocks, tribal spear) vs. scout troopers (sniper rifle, blaster pistol, thermal detonator, autoturret)\n\n\u2022 Geonosis: Geonosians (sonic blaster) vs. clone sharpshooters (sniper rifle, blaster pistol, thermal detonator, autoturret)\n\n\u2022 Hoth: Wampas (claw) vs. Rebel Infantry (All Variations)\n\n\u2022 Kashyyyk: Wookiees (bowcaster, fusioncutter or thermal detonator) vs. IG-100 MagnaGuards (Bulldog Rocket Launcher, Radiation Launcher, Neuro Poison, Recon droid)\n\n\u2022 Mos Eisley: Jawas (Ion blaster, fusioncutter) vs. Tusken Raiders (Bolt Action Rifle or Tusken cycler)\n\n\u2022 Naboo: Gungans (fusioncutter, thermal detonator) vs. super battle droids (wrist blaster, TriShot, wrist rocket)\n\n\u2022 Rhen Var (Xbox Live download): Wampas (claw) vs. Rebel Infantry (All Variations)\n\n\u2022 Capture the Flag\n\nCapture the Flag, or CTF for short, is another mode available for play on all maps (including space maps). In CTF, two factions try to capture a flag and return it to a base. Points are awarded to the team for the number of flags recovered. Winners are determined by the number of flags captured, either by a set number of captures or a time limit. When a Jet or Dark Trooper picks up the flag they can't fly. When Jedi pick up the flag they will not be able to use Force Jump or Force Hover. Droidekas cannot pick up the flag while in ball mode. Some rules vary depending on the variations present in the game, 1-flag and 2-flag.\n\n\u2022 1-flag CTF\n\nIn 1-flag CTF, a neutral flag is placed approximately halfway between each factions bases. The objective is to capture the flag and bring it to the opposite factions base. This is the only CTF mode available for Space maps and some close to big maps like Yavin 4 or Hoth.\n\n\u2022 2-flag CTF\n\n2-flag CTF resembles traditional Capture the Flag. It involves two factions which both hold a flag at their respective bases. The player must steal the flag from the enemy's base and return it to their own base.\n\n\u2022 Hero Assault Mode\n\nThis mode, taking place only on the Mos Eisley map, pits multiple copies of the game's playable Heroes against multiple copies of the playable Villains.\nThe game plays out much like a Space Assault mode battle: the two teams battle each other to gain a set amount of points. The team to reach that number first wins.\nIn the Xbox Live download players are able to play Hero Assault mode at Kashyyyk. It plays out with the Heroes controlling the sea wall and Villains attacking from the island.\n\n\u2022 XL\n\nThis mode is only available on the PC in single player mode on the Kashyyyk, Hoth, and Geonosis maps. The idea is similar to Assault mode. When the player's team is the first to reach a certain number of points, victory is declared. The mode also limits the command posts, so that none can be captured or lost. The difference between XL and Assault is that in Assault there are always 180 obtainable points for each team, while in XL there can be more than 300 soldiers on each side. This mode is only available in the PC version because the PC is the only system able to calculate the huge numbers of entities.\n\n\u2022 Troop classes\n\nA total of eight classes are available to play &ndash; six for land, two for space. Each offers a different battlefield function. Almost all classes are identical for each faction, keeping the game balanced. The \"Unique\" class is different for each side and varies with the map. In the instant action mode you can add units if points increase like wookiee warrior or CIS Magna Guard.\n\n\u2022 Land Classes/Infantry\n\n\u2022 Soldier Class\n\nThe Trooper, or Soldier Class is a well-rounded class that serves as the keystone of the armies. They have a notable weakness against Vehicles, but can destroy one in groups, and are effective in nearly every situation, from close combat firefights to long range suppressive fire. They carry blaster rifles which are effective at short, medium, as well as long ranges. These soldiers also carry 4 thermal detonators, while other classes can only carry 2. Because of their rapid-fire blaster rifles, troopers are often the frontline troops and are best at taking out enemy infantry head-on. They are fairly well-balanced in terms of speed, firepower, and endurance.\nThe soldiers of each faction are:\n\u2022 Galactic Republic: Clone Trooper (DC-15 blaster rifle, DC-15s blaster pistol, V-1 thermal detonator)\n\n\u2022 CIS: Super Battle Droid (wrist blaster, Tri Shot, wrist rocket)\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance: Rebel Soldier (DH-17 blaster rifle, DL-44 blaster pistol, Class-A thermal detonators)\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire: Stormtrooper (E-11 blaster rifle, SE-14r light repeating blaster pistol/scout trooper blaster pistol (depending on console), baradium-core thermal detonators)\n\n\u2022 Heavy Weapons Class\n\nThe Heavy Weapons Class is a common division in most armies. It consists of soldiers armed with missile launchers that are able to lock-on and home in on vehicles, primarily used to destroy vehicles and turrets. They also carry two thermal detonators, mines, and a light blaster pistol for short-range protection. As one of the heaviest units, they have one of the highest endurance and defense and can sustain a lot more damage than units from other classes. They are, however, one of the slowest units in the game, and as their launchers cannot lock on to non-vehicle targets and require reloading after each shot, they are not well suited for dealing with groups of enemy infantry. In addition to their missile launchers, heavy troopers are equipped with a standard blaster pistol as a side-arm, thermal detonators, and proximity mines. These mines emit an obvious red-glow and will not be set off by a teammate, although it can still kill them if they are caught in the blast radius.\nThe heavy weapon specialists of each faction are:\n\u2022 Galactic Republic: Clone Heavy Trooper (PLX rocket launcher, DC-15s blaster pistol, V-1 thermal detonators, HX2 mines)\n\n\u2022 CIS: Assault Battle Droid (E-60R rocket launcher, SE-14 blaster pistol, V-1 thermal detonators, HX2 mines)\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance: Rebel Vanguard (HH-15 rocket launcher, DL-44 heavy blaster pistol, Class-A thermal detonators , 3HX3 mines)\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire: Shock Trooper (PTL rocket launcher, SE-14r light repeating blaster pistol/scout trooper blaster pistol (depending on console), baradium-core thermal detonators, KE-6b mines)\n\n\u2022 Sniper Class\n\nThe Sniper Class consists of snipers who are equipped with extremely high powered long-range rifles. It takes a single headshot to kill every unit except Heroes and droidekas. Often, snipers operate in elevated positions, away from the center of battle, where they can quietly eliminate an entire team without being noticed. They are the ultimate unit for long-range fighting and also work well at medium ranges and can also deploy auto-turrets for extra defense. While their long-range sniper rifles make them effective units in dealing with infantry, they also make them the weakest units in taking out vehicles and enclosed turrets, being able to deal practically no damage to artillery. Moreover, their rifles are light and quick at aiming even at close ranges, but the slow rate-of-fire and light armor make them nevertheless inefficient at directly facing groups of soldier units. Being the lightest troops in the game, they have the fastest speed at the cost of having the least endurance.\nThe snipers of each faction are:\n\u2022 Galactic Republic: Clone Sharpshooter (DC-15x sniper rifle, DC-15s blaster pistol, V-1 thermal detonators, autoturret)\n\n\u2022 CIS: Assassin Droid (E-5s sniper rifle, SE-14 blaster pistol, V-1 Thermal Detonators, autoturret)\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance: Rebel Marksman (E-17d sniper rifle, DL-44 heavy blaster pistol, Class-A thermal detonators, autoturret)\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire: Scout Trooper (E-11s sniper rifle, SE-14r light repeating blaster pistol/scout trooper blaster pistol (depending on console), baradium-core thermal detonators, autoturret)\n\n\u2022 Engineer Class\n\nThe Engineer Class are the troopers called to provide battlefield repairs and act as medics and ammo suppliers. It consists of engineers (or technicians) who carry handheld shotguns and explosive detpacks, which, unlike the proximity mines of heavy weapon specialists, can be detonated remotely. They also carry fusioncutters, which can repair allied vehicles, construct and repair turrets, or slice into enemy vehicles. Their shotguns are extremely deadly at close-range, but nevertheless the cost of rate-of-fire usually makes them inferior to the faster firing soldiers. Because of this, engineers mainly serve as support units for the main-line assault units. Their speed is secondary compared to that of snipers and are also second to them in terms of weakest endurance and defense.\nThe engineers of each faction are:\n\u2022 Galactic Republic: Clone engineer (shotgun, F-187 fusioncutter, detpacks, health and ammo dispenser)\n\n\u2022 CIS: Engineer Droid (shotgun, F-187 fusioncutter, detpacks, health and ammo dispenser)\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance: Rebel Smuggler (CR-1 blaster cannon, F-187 fusioncutter, detpacks, health and ammo dispenser)\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire: Imperial Engineer (blast cannon, F-187 fusioncutter, detpacks, health and ammo dispenser)\n\n\u2022 Special Class 1\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront II introduces an extra special unit class. Each unit within this class have their own unique set of weapons and equipment. Each unit of this class has their own ability to affect those around them, either increasing stats of their teammates or decreasing health of enemies. In contrast to the other previous classes, a player must unlock 8 points in a battle before being able to use a unit from the first special class.\nThe special units of each faction are:\n\u2022 Clone Commander (Galactic Republic) (chaingun, DC-15s Blaster Pistol, Rally [Defense Increase], Mark IV recon droid)\n\nThe clone commanders signature weapon, the rapid-firing chaingun, is most effective in more enclosed areas against a small number of enemies. The chaingun is, arguably, the best gun in the game, as it can quickly eliminate multiple enemies under its incredible rate of fire. However, it has a short delay before firing as its barrels spin up and is ineffective against vehicles and turrets, being comparable to that of the sniper rifles power on vehicles. Commanders carry a blaster pistol for short range protection and emergency use if their chaingun is overheated or did not have time to spin up. They can also use Rally to temporarily boost all nearby friendly troops' morale and increase their resistance to damage, thus a team is at its most effective when traveling with a Clone Commander. In addition, they have a recon droid to serve as short-range reconnaissance. The recon droid, although is has a limited period of time before exploding, can defend itself with a weak blaster or a self-destruct mechanism. Unfortunately, deploying a recon droid renders the user immobile and completely vulnerable to enemy fire while the droid itself is often destroyed while preparing to self-destruct, at which point it must remain immobile before detonating.\n\u2022 MagnaGuard (Confederacy of Independent Systems) (Bulldog RLR, radiation launcher, Neuro Poison, Mark IV recon droid)\n\nMagnaguards are advanced droids that carry an arsenal of explosive weapons. Their Bulldog RLRs missiles can lock onto an enemy (even infantry) and kill in one to two shots, or they could be launched rapidly without locking on. Their radiation launchers are ballistic weapons that dispense projectiles similar to grenades, and is itself a type of grenade launcher, but with almost no splash damage. Like the clone commanders they carry with them recon droids for reconnaissance. However, the Magnaguards weapons have limited ammunition and a slower rate of fire, meaning that they are best used to provide supporting fire to supplement its allies. Moreover, they are equipped with one-use neuro poison dispenser, which slowly reduces the health of all nearby units (except droids) once activated, thereby eventually causing inevitable death.\n\u2022 Imperial officer (Galactic Empire) (sonic blaster, V-6d mortar launcher, Rage [Damage Increase], Mark IV recon droid)\n\nImperial officers have an arsenal similar to the Magnaguards. Their primary weapon is a sonic blaster, quick-firing blasters with a wide-range but very low power, as is typical of sonic weapons in Battlefront. Alongside this sonic gun is a mortar launcher, which fires grenades that can either explode on impact or delayed with a charged setting to allow ricochet. Just like the previous two units, Imperial officers are also each equipped with a recon droid. Their Rage bonus temporarily augments the firepower of nearby allies, thus serving most effectively when traveling in a group with friendly troops. Like the Magnaguard, the Imperial officers weapons have limited ammo and a slow rate of fire, making them more of a support class to allies.\n\u2022 Bothan Spy (Rebel Alliance) (incinerator, [Health] Regeneration, Stealth, TB-47 time bomb)\n\nBothan spies are units equipped for mostly stealth and strategic purposes. Their primary weapon is a short-range incinerator rifle that can quickly take out groups of enemies with increasing firepower. Despite its high rate-of-fire, however, the incinerator nevertheless takes more time to kill than a standard blaster rifle would in some cases. Because of this, it is usually used in conjunction with their stealth field generator, which allows them to become invisible. While invisible, a Bothan spy can utilize ambush tactics on their unaware enemy or capture command posts unseen. However, the user would be immediately forced out of stealth the moment they fire a wave of incinerating blasts, and if timed incorrectly, they can easily be taken out by a group of soldiers. Unlike the previous three special units, the recon droid is replaced with a sticky time bomb that detonates with a large concussive blast after 5 seconds. These bombs can be planted on an unsuspecting enemy turret. Finally, Bothans have the ability to gradually regenerate the health of all nearby comrades.\n\n\u2022 Special Class 2\n\nLike the previous class, the second group of special units also defy categorization in terms of weapons and abilities. Therefore, each unit has their own strengths and weaknesses but cannot be used until a player earns a total of 12 points in a battle.\nThe advanced special units of each faction are:\n\u2022 Clone jet trooper (Galactic Republic) (EMP launcher, DC-17 blaster pistol, V-1 thermal detonators)\n\nClone jet troopers main advantage is their agility, granted to them by their jetpacks, which allows them to quickly traverse great distances and gives them advantageous position over the enemy. Their EMP launchers fire devastating blasts of electromagnetism which, though slow-moving, can kill an enemy in one shot and eliminate a droidekas shield in two. They are equipped with a rapid-firing commando pistol as a sidearm, which is stronger than the regular blaster pistol. These units can be used to sneak up behind enemies using their jetpacks and ambush them from behind, then spring away to safety while they reload. They are the Republics answer to the CIS droideka due to their agility in dodging the devastating laser bolts from destroyer droids and their EMP launchers effectiveness in taking down their shields. However, they have gone down in defense and endurance since the previous game, and the electromagnetic blast radius of their EMP launchers also have a smaller splash damage radius than before. To accommodate their jetpack, they are impervious to fall damage.\n\u2022 Droideka (Confederacy of Independent Systems) (repeating blasters, personal shield)\n\nDroidekas are arguably one of the most powerful special units in the game. Their twin repeating blasters are one of the most devastating in-game, and their personal shield emitters give them one of the strongest defense. Using their shield in conjunction with their blasters, they can easily mow down multiple troops. Because of this, they are well-suited to massive firefights. Their shields can also be used to protect allies behind the shield and allow them to reload weapons. The droideka is not without flaws, however. It can not enter vehicles, as the manual states that the droideka itself is considered a vehicle. Its shield lasts for twenty to thirty seconds and can quickly be dissipated under fire from large groups of enemies. Additionally, they must be rolled up into a ball in order to travel quickly from place to place. Although fast, they are completely vulnerable when in this mode, as they are unable to raise their shield or fire their weapons. To attack, they must be deployed into their open configuration, at which point they would be one of the slowest units in the game, only being able to move at a very slow speed and also having a limited horizontal rotation rate.\n\u2022 Dark Trooper (Galactic Empire) (arc caster, SE-14r light repeating blaster pistol, baradium-core thermal detonators)\n\nThe dark trooper is the Imperial counterpart to the jet trooper. Their jump-packs can boost them off the ground very quickly, but unlike the jet trooper's jetpack, it sacrifices accuracy for speed and height. Their powerful arc casters fire a mid-ranged, wide bolt of electricity, which, when charged, can \"arc\" from one unit to up to four other units. They also carry a fast-firing commando pistol as a sidearm and, like the jet trooper, they can be used to gain an advantageous position over an enemy or ambush them from behind. As a result of their jump pack ability, they do not sustain fall damage.\n\u2022 Wookiee Warrior (Rebel Alliance) (Wookiee Bowcaster, HH-4 grenade launcher, Class A thermal detonators, Mark IV recon droid)\n\nThe Wookiee warrior has the most stamina of all units, about twice of that of a normal soldier, which makes up for their lack of speed and slow-firing arsenal. Their high endurance makes them able to withstand far more damage, sometimes being able to survive even a grenade. They are heavy hitters, with a unique bowcaster that can fire a spread of deadly shots, or fire a large, powerful bolt when charged up. The hand-made bowcaster features a scope with two zoom capabilities and can be used as an effective sniper rifle when charged and zoomed. They carry grenade launchers that fire ballistic grenades, which explode after a few seconds when making contact with the ground. They also carry 4 thermal detonators to clear up large groups of enemies, and a recon droid to scout an area.\n\n\u2022 Space Classes/Naval Force\n\n\u2022 Pilot Class\n\nThe Pilot Class is used to launch assaults in space. Pilots are most useful in the cockpit of a starfighter, being able to automatically repair any ship they occupy. On the ground, they are each equipped with a commando pistol, time bombs, and fusion cutters. Although much more practical piloting a starfighter than fighting on-ground, their time bombs are the most effective at taking out critical systems from the interior of a capital ship. Their stamina, defense, and speed are roughly equivalent to that of an engineer.\nThe pilot class included:\n\u2022 Galactic Republic: Clone Pilot (commando pistol, F-187 fusioncutter, TB-47 time bombs)\n\n\u2022 CIS: Pilot Droid (commando pistol, F-187 fusioncutter, TB-47 time bombs)\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance: Rebel Pilot (commando pistol, F-187 fusioncutter, TB-47 time bomb)\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire: Imperial Pilot (commando pistol, F-187 fusioncutter, TB-47 time bomb)\n\n\u2022 Marine class\n\nThe marine class is a standard division of troops in most armies. They are trained to defend their capital ship in the event that it is boarded by enemy troops or to do vice versa. Marines are armed with portable rocket launchers for demolishing enemy ships, as well as regular blaster rifles and thermal detonators. Because they lack the ability to automatically repair any starfighter they occupy, they are not recommended to be used as bombers or dogfighters. Instead, they are most useful in raiding the enemy cruiser.\nThe marine class included:\n\u2022 Clone Marine (Galactic Republic) (DC-15 blaster rifle, PLX rocket launcher, V-1 thermal detonators)\n\n\u2022 Droid marine (Confederacy of Independent Systems) (E-5 blaster rifle, E-60R missile launcher, V-1 thermal detonator)\n\n\u2022 Rebel Marine (Rebel Alliance) (DH-17 blaster rifle, HH-15 rocket launcher, Class A thermal detonators)\n\n\u2022 Imperial Marines (Galactic Empire) (E-11 blaster rifle, PTL rocket launcher, baradium-core thermal detonators]])\n\n\u2022 Trooper Variants\n\nOn certain levels, certain characters have outfit changes to match the environment or as seen in the Star Wars Movies. The following lists the levels where the classes have a special outfit instead of the standard that is used on all other maps.\n\n\u2022 Galactic Republic\n\n\u2022 All clone troopers, except the clone commander: Phase I armor&mdash;Geonosis\n\n\u2022 Clone sharpshooter: clone scout trooper outfit&mdash;Kashyyyk, Felucia, Mustafar CTF\n\n\u2022 Confederacy of Independent Systems\n\n\u2022 Assassin Droid: camouflage grass paint job&mdash;Felucia and Kashyyyk. sand paint job&mdash;Tatooine and Geonosis\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire\n\n\u2022 Anakin Skywalker: Sith cloak&mdash;Jedi Temple (Campaign mode only)\n\n\u2022 All Imperials except Imperial officer and dark trooper: snowtrooper outfit&mdash;Hoth\n\n\u2022 Imperial engineers : AT-AT pilot&mdash;Hoth\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance\n\n\u2022 Luke Skywalker: Pilot outfit&mdash;Hoth, black Jedi outfit&mdash;Jabbas Palace, Death Star, Mygeeto, Coruscant\n\n\u2022 All Rebels except Rebel smuggler, Wookiee warrior, and Bothan spy: snow outfit&mdash;Hoth, Gray outfit&mdash;Dagobah, Polis Massa, jungle outfit&mdash;Yavin 4, Endor, Kashyyyk, desert outfit&mdash;Tatooine, Utapau, Tantive IV outfit&mdash;Tantive IV, Death Star., aqua outfit&mdash;Kamino,\n\n\u2022 Award Weapons\n\nPlayers can earn weapon upgrades, depending on the soldier type. All reward weapons (excluding the Guidable Rockets) replace an existing weapon. It should be noted that some of the weapons can be either situationally weaker and/or more limited than the one it replaces. A prime example is the AWARD sniper rifle-the beam is ineffective in some situation where the regular sniper rifle is fine. In the event of trying to snipe a target from the top of a turret for example, where a head shot would be required, the AWARD rifle disregards headshots, but delivers an almost always instant kill body shot instead.\n-\nPrecision Pistol:\nAll Classes that wield a pistol\nFires faster, highly accurate and more powerful blaster bolts. However, the precision pistol has limited ammo, whereas the normal pistol has unlimited ammo and only overheats. Like Jango's Westar blaster.\nBlaster Pistol, Commando Pistol\n-\nElite Assault Rifle:\nTrooper/Soldier Class, Marine Class\nFires higher powered purple blaster bolts, which are more powerful than a normal blaster rifle, resulting in very quick kills. It fires 3 shots in quick succession with one trigger pull (burst fire). Like Boba's rifle.\nBlaster Rifle, Wrist Blaster\n-\nGuidable Rockets (Rocket Launcher):\nHeavy Weapons Class, Marine Class\nFires a guidable rocket. Control is identical to a space guidable missile and Chewbacca's guidable rocket.\nNone (existing rocket launcher remains)\n-\nFlechette shotgun:\nEngineer Class\nFires shrapnel which damages enemies even after collision with object. The shrapnel also does not spread as much, allowing for longer range. This is also the only AWARD weapon with more ammo than the regular weapon.\nShotgun, Blast Cannon\n-\nBeam Rifle:\nSniper Class\nFires a long-range powerful blaster beam, capable of firing through multiple enemies.\nSniper Rifle\n-\n\n\u2022 Weapons and Gear\n\n\u2022 Blaster and Projectile Weapons\n\n\u2022 Wrist Blaster: A blaster mounted on the wrist of a super battle droid. The weapon holds a clip of fifty rounds. Its rate of fire is slower than that of the blaster rifle. However, it deals slightly more amount of damage than a blaster rifle, and is more accurate.\n\n\u2022 TriShot: A powerful wrist-mounted variant of a shotgun which fires three powerful rounds in a triangular pattern, hence the name. If all three rounds hit a normal soldier, they would be left with only one hit point. However, the weapon has a slow rate of fire and will overheat in just three shots.\n\n\u2022 Blaster rifle: A rapid-firing, all-purpose rifle which fires blaster rounds that are effective at basically any range. The blaster rifle utilizes a fifty round clip. The trooper/soldier will carry between 200 to 300 rounds, depending on the military force in which he serves. The effectiveness of the weapon decreased with range, as the rifle would begin to lose much of its accuracy after several consecutive shots at long range.\n\n\u2022 Sniper rifle: A high-powered, long-range rifle with two zoom settings for its scope. It has a slow rate of fire, but can provide a one-hit kill when targeting an enemys head. The sniper rifles clip size holds five beam rounds. The weapon is best used to eliminate enemies at a distance. However, the sniper rifle can be effective at close ranges when wielded by a skilled user.\n\n\u2022 Blast cannon: This weapon fires a spread of eight rounds with each shot. The weapon has a slow rate of fire, and each of its clips holds only five rounds. The shotgun was most effective at close-quarters, where a target had a smaller range of motion. If fired at point-blank range, the weapon can kill with one shot.\n\n\u2022 Blaster pistol: A blaster pistol which fires rounds weaker than those of a blaster rifle. It is primarily used as a sidearm for close-range combat. The blaster pistol has infinite ammunition. However, the weapon overheats after several successive shots, and must be allowed to cool before it can be fired again.\n\n\u2022 Commando Pistol: A more potent variant of the aforementioned blaster pistol. The weapon deals more damage per round, fires faster, and cools more quickly than the standard blaster. The weapon is as effective as the blaster rifle when in the hands of a skilled user.\n\n\u2022 Chaingun: A devastating weapon with six rotating barrels which give it an incredibly fast rate of fire. It takes a few seconds for the weapon to commence firing once it has been activated. However, once it begins to fire, the weapon reaches a high rate of fire quite quickly. The chaingun can fire for a long time before overheating, and it cools rapidly. The weapon is used to quickly eliminate multiple enemies at close and medium range and is effective at eliminating heroes. The weapon is also effective for point defense purposes as well.\n\n\u2022 Repeating blaster: Twin heavy blasters mounted on the arms of droidekas. They have a high rate of fire and their rounds are equivalent to those of the blaster rifle. These blasters overheat quickly. When mounted upon droidekas, these weapons provide suppressive fire and can quickly cut down infantry that remain exposed.\n\n\u2022 Bowcaster: A handmade crossbow used by Wookiee Warriors. It features a scope with two zoom settings. The weapon fires a spread of small bolts. The bowcaster can also be charged up to fire a single bolt which has the same stopping power as a round from the sniper rifle.\n\n\u2022 Incinerator: A weapon that blasts forth a large, short-ranged wave of incinerating gases with each pull of the trigger. The weapon requires reloading after each round is fired. This weapon is most effective when using invisibility to sneak up on a small group of enemies and unleashing a huge wave of incendiary gases, damaging or killing multiple enemies at once.\n\n\u2022 Sonic blaster: A weapon which fires a large, short-ranged wave of sound that deals low to moderate damage upon a target.\n\n\u2022 ARC Caster: An electronic rifle that fires a short-ranged wave of electricity. The wave will both stun and injure its target. The weapon can electrocute up to five targets simultaneously.\n\n\u2022 Explosive Weapons\n\n\u2022 Thermal detonator: The standard explosive for soldiers, these are grenade-like weapons that can stick to or bounce off surfaces. They are thrown by hand and were effective for clearing away small groups of enemies, especially in narrow hallways and could be used to provide cover fire as the user reloaded or retreated. They were also used to destroy armored installations, especially turrets. Thermal detonators release all the thermal energy when thrown into any liquid environment like a lake or pond... they explode faster than normal.\n\n\u2022 Detpack: One of the most powerful explosives in the game, the detpack can be placed on the ground or on a wall and detonated remotely. They can be used to destroy enemy defenses or eliminate infantry, but can be destroyed by a Thermal detonator.\n\n\u2022 Wrist rocket: A slow-moving rocket fired from the wrist which would explode upon contact, resulting in a one-hit kill against infantry.\n\n\u2022 Mines: An extremely powerful explosive, mines can be planted at areas that are often traversed by enemies, called choke points. When enemies stepped on a mine, it would explode, killing all enemies within its effective range. Three Mines can do significant damage to an AT-AT. However, they can be destroyed with thermal detonators, fusion cutters, and rocket launchers. Engineers can safely cross them and clear the mines by slicing them with their tool. Mines can destroy most tanks with one mine, and kill heroes with a one-hit kill.\n\n\u2022 Missile launcher: An extremely powerful weapon which launched powerful rockets with a large blast radius. These weapons are devastating to vehicles and can kill multiple enemies in one shot through an explosion. Rocket launchers have limited ammo and take a long time to reload after each shot, but can be effective against infantry in the hands of a skilled user. They are also effective in large firefights where the enemy is especially concentrated, though the user runs the risk of damaging allies. This weapon is capable of locking onto and tracking vehicles.\n\n\u2022 EMP Launcher: A weapon which fires a single pulse of electromagnetic energy which, although slow-moving, can kill an enemy in one shot upon making contact. The EMP launcher is basically a rocket launcher modified for use against infantry, with a clip of two EM Power cells instead of rockets and a faster reloading time. However, the EMP has less splash damage and needs two direct hits to take down a Droideka's shield. The EMP launcher can be used on armored or multiple targets, especially when they are unaware.\n\n\u2022 Bulldog RLR: A rocket launcher that can fire six small rockets at a relatively fast rate. This weapon can lock-on to enemies and will almost always result in a one-hit kill. The rockets are easy to dodge, less powerful than the EMP launcher, and have very little splash damage. They can be used at close range or when an enemy is caught off guard.\n\n\u2022 Grenade launcher/Mortar launcher/Radiation Launcher: These ballistic weapons fire grenades which explode a few seconds after making contact with a surface. These are effective against both infantry and vehicles. Of the three, the radiation launcher is the most potent, as its explosion lasts slightly longer but as a disadvantage it does not damage vehicles. All versions of this weapon can be charged up to reach long ranges through the battlefield. An enemy infantryman can be damaged by the projectile if the weapon is fully charged and the projectile itself hits the enemy.\n\n\u2022 Time Bomb: A devastating bomb which detonates five seconds after being dropped. It is useful for shipboard sabotage, especially when they are dropped surreptitiously on a ship's hull just before it is launched, causing it to explode mid-flight. This bomb can eliminate or clear a massive wave of enemies. Only a powerful weapon like the detpack can destroy the time bomb.\n\n\u2022 Support Gear\n\n\u2022 Autoturret: Durable automatic turrets that are usually deployed to defend a command post or alert a sniper of approaching enemies. Though lacking in accuracy, these turrets are difficult to destroy and have a fast rate of fire.\n\n\u2022 Fusioncutter: An all-purpose engineering tool that can be used to hijack vehicles, repair ammo droids, health droids, and vehicles, or construct turrets on a turret platform.\n\n\u2022 Ammo and Health Dispenser: A dispenser which contains bacta and ammunition which can be used to aid allies or heal one's self. However, the ammunition canisters in the dispenser cannot replenish the dispenser amount.\n\n\u2022 Jetpack: A tool that uses repulsorlift technology to allow the user to fly through the air at the cost of fuel. The jetpack is both accurate and fast, allowing the user to reach inaccessible places. Jango Fett, Boba Fett, and jet troopers use these.\n\n\u2022 Jump pack: A type of jetpack that trades accuracy for height and speed. It projects the wearer in a large, sharp upward arc, landing them only a short distance away. It is far less accurate than the jetpack and spews dark smoke. Dark troopers use this.\n\n\u2022 Shield Emitter: A tool which generates a powerful personal shield that lasts for a limited time before it has to regenerate. The shield can absorb twenty blaster rifle shots but lost power the longer it is used. Droidekas use these.\n\n\u2022 Stealth: Bothan Spies use stealth to become nearly invisible. This ability depends on stamina, and the stamina is depleted by moving while under stealth. Strenuous actions such as rolling and sprinting while using stealth put the user at risk of being revealed. Stealth may also occasionally reveal the user briefly for no apparent reason.\n\n\u2022 Recon droid: A hovering droid used to scout an area. It is remotely controlled, can fire small blaster shots, and can self-destruct. It can be stopped from exploding if shot while self-destructing, although its small size and agility makes this difficult.\n\n\u2022 Rally Bonus: A bonus that makes enemy fire less damaging to oneself and nearby allies for a limited time.\n\n\u2022 Neuropoison: Rapidly poisons nearby enemies, depleting their health bar at a fast rate for a limited time. They continue to lose health even after moving out of the poison's effective range.\n\n\u2022 Rage Bonus: Increases the damage of oneself and nearby allies for a limited time.\n\n\u2022 Regeneration Bonus: Rapidly heals oneself and nearby allies for a limited time. This is the only bonus that cannot be earned with an AWARD.\n\n\u2022 Hero Weapons and Gear\n\n\u2022 Lightsaber: A hilt with a blade of plasma that can cut down enemies quickly and efficiently. This weapon is the signature weapon of both Jedi and Sith.\n\n\u2022 Double-bladed lightsaber: A pair of lightsabers connected in the middle by their hilts. This unique lightsaber variant gives the user a larger reach and a wider range when the lightsaber is thrown. This is the signature weapon of Darth Maul.\n\n\u2022 DL-44 heavy blaster pistol: A powerful, one-shot kill blaster that fires two rounds with one trigger pull. This is the signature weapon of Han Solo.\n\n\u2022 Defender sporting blaster pistol: Somewhat a pistol version of a sniper rifle, with the same power and rate of fire. However, it overheats quickly. This is the signature weapon of Princess Leia.\n\n\u2022 Invulnerability: Carried by Princess Leia, this bonus makes surrounding allies invulnerable to all enemy fire and explosives.\n\n\u2022 EE-3 carbine rifle: This weapon is identical to the AWARD rifle, except for the fact that it fires red bolts, rather than purple. It fires three high-powered rounds that usually result in a one-hit kill. The weapon is used by Boba Fett.\n\n\u2022 WESTAR-34 blaster pistol: This weapon is identical to the award pistol. It fires powerful and accurate bolts at an extremely fast rate. It is semi-automatic and has one zoom setting. Jango Fett uses this pistol as his signature weapon.\n\n\u2022 Flamethrower: A weapon which fires a short-ranged blast of fire that sets enemies aflame, slowly depleting their health. The fire extinguishes after several seconds and could be put out faster by rolling. Jango and Boba Fett use this weapon\n\n\u2022 Starblades: A weapon commonly utilized by Asajj Ventress, this attack can be used without limit by the Sith Assassin as a highly deadly projectile.\n\n\u2022 Jedi and Sith Abilities\n\nJedi and Sith have unique abilities which drain their stamina bar. Using the Force, these abilities extended the powers of the user beyond normal limits.\nLight Side Abilities\n\u2022 Force Push: An ability that pushes multiple opponents away, often used to create more room for the user. This ability can also be used to knock over opponents so that the Jedi or Sith can close into lightsaber range while they are getting up. Also it can be used to push enemy units off cliffs or into shafts such as those on the Death Star map.\n\n\u2022 Force Pull: The opposite of Force Push, this ability pulls a single opponent towards the user, where they are finished off by the attacker's lightsaber. This ability is best used to pull opponents out of large melees to avoid damaging allies with the lightsaber at close range. Like Push, it can also be used to more rapidly disable then kill an enemy with a dangerous ranged weapon.\n\n\u2022 Force Destruction: A powerful seismic wave generated when a Force-sensitive leaps into the air and slams their lightsaber down. This move is extremely powerful and blow opponents away from the user. Mace Windu and Kit Fisto are the only characters known to have this ability. Emperor Palpatine has a similar power with the difference being that lightning shoots up from the ground instead of a seismic wave. Heroes that do not have this ability will only perform a lightsaber attack consisting of a series of slashes when leaping into the air and attacking.\n\n\u2022 Force Orb: A throwable orb made of water, usable by Kit Fisto.\n\nDark Side Abilities\n\u2022 Force Choke: An ability that lifts an opponent into the air and slowly chokes them. Darth Vader is a notorious user of this ability. Droids can be affected by this, despite being non-living, simply because it crushes their inner circuits rather than choking them.\n\n\u2022 Force Lightning: Lightning generated by a Force-sensitive that severely damages an enemy. The lightning can \"jump\" from person to person, behaving like arcing electricity. Darth Sidious and Count Dooku are well-known for their use of the ability.\n\n\u2022 Force Hover: This power is similar to Force Jump. The user will jump twice and hover temporarily instead of the usual ability to triple jump. As lightsaber attacks performed by leaping into the air and attacking while coming down are especially powerful, this move is useful for hovering over an opponent and delivering a devastating blow with the lightsaber down on them. Darth Vader and Darth Sidious often employ this unique Force ability.\n\nNeutral Abilities\n\u2022 Block: The Force-sensitive will block all enemy fire in front of them with their lightsaber for as long as the stamina bar holds out. By rapidly wielding his four lightsabers, General Grievous also has this ability, although he is not Force-sensitive.\n\n\u2022 Force jump: A Force-sensitive will jump up to four times, except for Yoda, who jumps five. The maximum height for a Force jump is roughly equivalent to the maximum altitude at which a jet trooper can hover.\n\n\u2022 Force Speed: A Force-sensitive will dash at very high speeds for as long as their stamina bar holds out. The Force-sensitive becomes hard to hit by all enemy fire.\n\n\u2022 Saber-Throw: A very common, powerful Force power. The lightsaber of the user becomes almost like a boomerang; the spinning lightsaber is thrown towards enemies, and can also deal damage when it automatically returns to the user. More powerful than the average strike with a lightsaber, this move could be used to clear the field of multiple enemies, especially on the lightsaber's return trip. Darth Maul, with his double-bladed lightsaber, often uses this ability, his thrown lightsaber having two times the radius of an average lightsaber. Duck or roll are primary infantry abilities used to dodge saber-throw. However, Yoda, Count Dooku, and Darth Sidious do not have this ability as a Jedi or Sith.\n\n\u2022 Heroes\n\nAfter fulfilling the goals set in the Hero Options screen (e.g. earn 10 points), players are able to obtain the services of one of these Heroes to aid them. Each has a different ability and will last a limited amount of time. The time, represented by a lightsaber bar, will decrease faster if the player does negative things such as spawn-camping or killing teammates. The bar will increase if the player kills numerous enemy units or vehicles. Each team gets one Hero at a time, but there can be more than one Hero for each team per match if the Heroes are unlocked more than once. Each Jedi has the ability to use Force Jump and Force speed. The Force-sensitive characters also each get two of five special techniques. They are Force Pull (Jedi only), Force Push (both), Force Choke (Sith only), Force lightning (Sith only), Saber Throw (both). Most Jedi and Sith use a three attack combo, the last being the most powerful.\nEach faction has a hero that is primarily used more than others. Obi-Wan Kenobi can be used more than any hero in the Republic, Han Solo for the Rebellion, Darth Maul for the Confederacy, and Boba Fett for the Empire\nIn Hero Assault Mode, multiple heroes occupy the map. The lightsaber health bar is replaced by the standard non-hero health bar.\nThe characters Asajj Ventress and Kit Fisto are only available through the Xbox Live downloadable content.\n\n\u2022 Light Side Heroes\n\n\u2022 Galactic Republic\n\n-\nObi-Wan Kenobi\nLightsaber (blue)\nForce Push, Saber Throw\nMos Eisley, Kamino, Utapau, Naboo, Mustafar, Death Star\nBattle of the Heroes\n-\nYoda\nLightsaber (green)\nForce Push, Force Pull\nKashyyyk, Dagobah, Polis Massa, Tantive IV\nYoda Strikes Back\n-\nMace Windu\nLightsaber (purple)\nForce Push, Saber Throw, Force Destruction\nGeonosis, Yavin 4, Coruscant\nFighting the Battle Droids\n-\nKi-Adi-Mundi\nLightsaber (blue)\nForce Pull, Saber Throw\nMygeeto\nOnward to Utapau\n-\nAayla Secura\nDual Lightsabers (blue, green) (PSP: blue, purple)\nForce Pull, Saber Throw\nBespin, Felucia, Jabbas Palace\nGoodbye, Old Friend\n-\nKit Fisto (Xbox download only)\nLightsaber (green)\nSaber Throw, Force Water Orb, Force Destruction\nRhen Var\nOnward to Utapau\n-\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance\n\n-\nLuke Skywalker\nLightsaber (green)\nForce Push, Saber Throw\nDeath Star, Jabbas Palace, Coruscant, Mygeeto, Yavin 4\nThe Battle of Hoth: Beneath the AT-AT\n-\nLuke Skywalker (pilot)\nLightsaber (blue)\nForce Push, Saber Throw\nHoth\nThe Battle of Hoth: Beneath the AT-AT\n-\nHan Solo\nDL44 Blaster, Fusioncutter, Detpack\nRally\nEndor, Utapau, Kamino, Mos Eisley, Rhen Var Citadel, Bespin (CTF)\nDeparture of Boba Fett\n-\nChewbacca\nBowcaster, Guided Rocket, Time Bomb\nRage\nKashyyyk, Yavin 4, Felucia, Rhen Var Harbor\nShootout in the Detention Block\n-\nPrincess Leia\nDefender sporting blaster, Thermal detonators\nInvulnerability\nTantive IV, Naboo, Polis Massa\nSnowspeeders Take Flight\n-\nYoda\nLightsaber (green)\nForce Push, Force Pull\nDagobah\nYoda Strikes Back\n-\nObi-Wan Kenobi\nLightsaber (blue)\nForce Push, Saber throw\nMustafar\nBattle of the Heroes\n\n\u2022 Dark Side Villains\n\n\u2022 Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS)\n\n-\nCount Dooku\nLightsaber (red)\nForce lightning, Force Choke\nGeonosis\nAnakin's Dark Deeds\n-\nGeneral Grievous\nTwo Lightsabers/Four Lightsabers (blue, green) (First two attacks have 2 sabers; the third and sprint attacks use 4 sabers)\nRage\nUtapau, Tantive IV, Dagobah, Mygeeto\nThe Flag Parade\n-\nJango Fett\nWESTAR-34 blaster pistol, Flamethrower, Wrist Rocket, Time Bomb\nJetpack\nKamino, Kashyyyk, Felucia\nJango's Escape\n-\nDarth Maul\nDouble-bladed Lightsaber (red)\nForce Push, Saber Throw\nMos Eisley, Coruscant, Naboo, Polis Massa, Jabbas Palace, Yavin 4, Mustafar, Rhen Var Citadel\nReturn to Tatooine (Duel of the Fates section)\n-\nDarth Sidious (Palpatine)\nLightsaber (red)\nForce lightning, Force Choke\nDeath Star\nI Am the Senate\n-\nAsajj Ventress (Xbox download only)\nPaired lightsabers (red)\nStarblades, Force Push\nRhen Var, Bespin, Yavin 4 Arena\nAnakin\u2019s Dark Deeds\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire\n\nAnakin vs. Obi-Wan/The Boys Continue (Instant Action), Love Pledge and The Arena (Campaign)\n\n\u2022 Neutral sides/creatures\n\nin Jabbas Palace on Tatooine.]]\nOn certain levels, there are three way battles between the two normal sides and a neutral side, and on others, the natives join a certain side (except for the Empire, which has no native creatures). In addition, there are native creatures that will attack anything that comes across their path. The Jawas on Mos Eisley are an exception, they can create turrets and rebuild ammo and health droids, but mostly will wander around the map to keep doing these things, and despite seeing one with the occasional rifle, they are completely non-aggressive.\n-\nAcklay\nFelucia (only in Campaign Mode)\nHostile (attacks Republic forces and droid turrets.)\n-\nEwok\nEndor\nRebel Alliance\n-\nGamorrean\nJabbas Palace\nHostile\n-\nGeonosian\nGeonosis\nCIS\n-\nGungan\nNaboo (only in Hunt Mode)\nGalactic Republic, Rebel Alliance (only on PSP Challenge)\n-\nJawa\nMos Eisley\nNone (non-aggressive)\n-\nRancor\nJabbas Palace\nHostile-Cannot be killed\n-\nWookiee\nKashyyyk\nGalactic Republic, Rebel Alliance\n-\nWampa\nHoth (only in Hunt Mode)\nHostile\n-\nTusken Raider\nMos Eisley (only in Hunt Mode)\nHostile\n\n\u2022 Capital ships\n\nIn space combat, each faction will have capital ships.

With the exception of the hangar, the rooms in the battleships have auto-turrets in them that will fire on intruders, though they are not as powerful as the turrets used by the auto-turret bonus. The battleships have a few powerful rapid firing auto-turrets on the outside which can make short work of any type of ship, which a player can also manually control like other turrets, and the shields on the ship make destroying the turrets very difficult. The external turrets will cease firing if the auto-turret defense mainframe inside the ship is destroyed, though the internal turrets will still operate. The shield generators destruction, also inside the ship, results in the shields outside the battleship being lowered, though sometimes a glitch in the game causes that to not happen, and although just shooting at the battleship will lower the shields, doing so takes considerable time and destroying the shield generator on the inside is much faster. However, the shield generator can be repaired, but it takes some time unless multiple players, playing as the Pilot class, chip in with their Fusioncutters to repair it faster, protecting the external targets for an additional amount of time. Battleships cant be destroyed, but they do have internal and external systems that can be. Outside of the previously mentioned shield generator and auto-turret defense mainframe, there is an externally mounted bridge, life-support systems, communications relay, short-range sensors, and engines. Internally the engine cooling tanks and the life support systems can also be destroyed on the inside. Destroying these, unlike the shields and defense mainframes, does not affect gameplay, but does award whoever destroys them a large sum of points, except in CTF. Internal systems take roughly 2-4 time bombs to destroy. External ones take dozens of bombs at the very least. The other ships are frigates, which cannot be boarded. The number of them that each side has varies from map to map. Unlike battleships, they can be destroyed, but are very durable so it takes time. The frigates have several turrets mounted on them that can make short work of incoming ships, but they wont always fire on a ship depending on how close or how far away they are. Despite their strong weapons, the frigates are very vulnerable to bombers and even a single one can take out a frigate with little difficulty if no fighters intervene. Destroying a frigate gives the same number of points to a side as destroying a system on a ship, except in a CTF match, but even in there its likely a good idea to have a player destroy the enemy frigates to keep them from shooting their fighters down.\nIf the player plays as an interceptor in the Kashyyyk space level then it's possible to fly up to the Droid control ships, Venator class star destroyers and Trade Federation Cruisers in the distance, which are in fact smaller, less realistic models which cause damage when flown into.\n\n\u2022 Galactic Republic\n\n\u2022 Battleship: Venator-class Star Destroyers\n\n\u2022 Frigate: Acclamator-class assault ships\n\n\u2022 Frigate: Victory II-class frigate (seen only in background)\n\n\u2022 Confederacy of Independent Systems\n\n\u2022 Battleship: Providence-class carrier/destroyers\n\n\u2022 Frigate: Munificent-class star frigates\n\n\u2022 Battleship: Lucrehulk-class battleship (seen only in background and as stationary, not-doing-anything object in the Battle of Coruscant space map)\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire\n\n\u2022 Battleship: Imperial-class Star Destroyers\n\n\u2022 Frigate: Victory II-class frigates\n\n\u2022 Battleship: Executor-class Star Dreadnoughts (seen only in background)\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance\n\n\u2022 Battleship: Mon Calamari Star cruisers\n\n\u2022 Frigate: CR-90 corvettes\n\n\u2022 Frigate: GR-75 medium transport (on Hoth and Yavin 4 campaign space battle)\n\n\u2022 Functions of Different Starfighters\n\nEach faction (Republic, CIS, Rebel, Empire) features four different types of ships:\n\u2022 Bomber: (V-wing, CIS strike bomber, Y-wing, TIE bomber)\n\nBombers are used to take out transports, shields, and ship main systems outside the capital ships. These ships carry high-yield proton bombs. They cannot lock bombs to enemy fighters and have significantly more armor than fighters and interceptors but not more than transports.\n\u2022 Multi-Purpose Fighter: (ARC-170 starfighter, Vulture droid starfighter, X-wing, TIE fighter)\n\nFighters are all-purpose ships useful for any situation. These starfighters cannot perform specific functions as well as specialized craft. These ships have lock-on torpedoes, and have significantly more armor than interceptors, but not more than bombers and transports.\n\u2022 Scout Fighter/Interceptor: (Jedi interceptor, Droid tri-fighter, A-wing, TIE Interceptor)\n\nInterceptors are high-speed fighters used to dogfight other starfighters. Although these ships can take out starfighters with ease, these are low in power and armor. These ships generally hold cluster missiles and can lock onto targets very quickly.\n\u2022 Transport: (Republic gunship, HMP droid gunship, Alliance Assault Craft (LAAT/i), Theta-class T-2c shuttle)\n\nTransports are extremely high in defense, are the slowest and least maneuverable space units. These ships also have multiple positions, up to six, including a main gunner, second gunner, and passengers. Secondary weapons on the ship vary from faction to faction. The troop transports act as spawn points when landed: as long as a transport is manned by at least one pilot, infantry will continue to spawn from the transport. However, they cannot perform evasive maneuvers.\n\n\u2022 Planetary vehicles\n\nEach faction uses three distinct types of vehicles. These vary in terms of speed, armor, and firepower. These types are :\n\u2022 Scout (74-Z speeder bike, the STAP, and the Tauntaun)\n\nSuch vehicles are very fast but have little firepower and armor. The Tauntaun does not have any weapons.\n\u2022 Medium (TX-130S tank, the AAT, the Droid tank, and the Rebel combat landspeeder)\n\nThis type of vehicles feature medium characteristics, having firepower.\n\u2022 Heavy vehicles (Spider droid and the AT-ST ).\n\nHeavy transports are massive vehicles that serve as mobile command posts. They possess amazing firepower and armor, but are very slow. They also cannot be sliced by enemy engineers and cannot be destroyed with a single landmine and function as mobile spawning points. These are the AT-TE for the Republic on Geonosis and Felucia and the AT-AT for the Empire on Hoth.\nThe vehicles of the factions are ( not all vehicles available at every map ) :\nConfederacy of Independent Systems:\n\u2022 STAP (Scout vehicle)\n\n\u2022 AAT (Medium vehicle)\n\n\u2022 Tank Droid (Medium vehicle)\n\n\u2022 Hailfire Droid (Medium vehicle)\n\n\u2022 Spider Droid (Heavy vehicle)\n\nGalactic Republic:\n\u2022 BARC speeder (Scout vehicle)\n\n\u2022 TX-130S fighter tank (Medium vehicle)\n\n\u2022 AT-RT (Medium vehicle)\n\n\u2022 AT-TE (Heavy Transport)\n\nGalactic Empire:\n\u2022 Speeder Bike (Scout vehicle)\n\n\u2022 Saber-class fighter tank (Medium vehicle)\n\n\u2022 AT-ST (Heavy vehicle)\n\n\u2022 AT-AT (Heavy Transport)\n\nRebel Alliance:\n\u2022 Speeder Bike (Scout)\n\n\u2022 Snowspeeder (Spacecraft; characteristics similar to an interceptor)\n\n\u2022 Tauntaun (Scout)\n\n\u2022 AAC-1 Hovertank (Medium vehicle)\n\n\u2022 Critical hit locations\n\nAll vehicles have a critical hit point that, when struck with an explosive round, depletes, at the most, 70% of their health. The critical hit point is hard to see and even harder to hit.\n\u2022 AAC-1 speeder tank: Black coolant tanks on sides of tank\n\n\u2022 TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank and TX-130T fighter tank: Circle at rear of tanks\n\n\u2022 AT-TE: Cylindrical area along the underbelly\n\n\u2022 AT-AT: Neck between body and head\n\n\u2022 AAT: Rear panel\n\n\u2022 Droid Tank: Rear tread cylinder\n\n\u2022 Hailfire Droid: Cylinders below cockpit\n\n\u2022 AT-RT: Cylinder between legs or pilot\n\n\u2022 Homing Spider Droid: Where the legs connect to the body on the sides\n\n\u2022 AT-ST: Rear block between legs\n\n\u2022 LAAT/i Gunship: Cockpit\n\n\u2022 Theta-class shuttle: Lower neck\n\n\u2022 Droid Transport: Rear panel\n\n\u2022 STAP: Anywhere\n\nIf players were to hit close to the critical hit location on a vehicle, they would do twice as much damage as a rocket launcher would regularly do (about 25-30%). Locking on to some of these vehicles at a adequate range and radius might lead the rocket to the critical point.\n\n\u2022 Battlefronts\n\nIn Battlefront II, there are no two maps that take place on the same planet excluding Tatooine and space levels, as this adds more variety to the missions.\nThere are 18 land maps and six space maps in instant action (Space Coruscant and Space Mustafar are not in instant action). This means that Battlefront II has over five times as much variety as its predecessor had. Some space maps such as Space Coruscant and Space Mustafar are only available in Campaign mode, however all space maps are available in Galactic Conquest.\n\n\u2022 All-use maps\n\n-\nCoruscant\nJedi Temple\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 2 Flag CTF, Hero Assault (Xbox Live patch only)\nDarth Maul (CIS), Darth Vader (Empire in Story Mode), Luke Skywalker (Rebels), Mace Windu (Republic), The Emperor (Empire)\n-\nDagobah\nSwamp near Yodas hut\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, 2 Flag CTF\nDarth Vader (Empire), Yoda (Republic and Rebels), General Grievous (CIS)\n-\nDeath Star\nInterior\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 1 Flag CTF\nEmperor Palpatine (Empire, CIS), Luke Skywalker (Rebels), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Republic)\n-\nFelucia\nMarshland\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 1 Flag CTF\nAayla Secura (Republic), Jango Fett (CIS), Chewbacca (Rebels), Boba Fett (Empire)\n-\nKamino\nClone Facility\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 1 Flag CTF\nObi-Wan Kenobi (Republic), Jango Fett (CIS), Boba Fett (Empire), Han Solo (Rebels)\n-\nKashyyyk\nBeachhead\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 2 Flag CTF, Hunt, Hero Assault (Xbox Live patch only), XL (PC only),\nChewbacca (Rebels), Jango Fett (CIS), Yoda (Republic), Boba Fett (Empire)\n-\nMustafar\nRefinery\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 2 Flag CTF\nDarth Vader in Anakin Skywalker form (Empire), Darth Maul (CIS), Gizor Dellso (CIS in Campaign mode), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Rebels, Republic)\n-\nMygeeto\nWar-Torn City\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 2 Flag CTF, Hero Assault (Xbox Live patch only)\nKi-Adi-Mundi (Republic), General Grievous (CIS), Boba Fett (Empire), Luke Skywalker (Rebels)\n-\nNaboo\nTheed\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 2 Flag CTF, Hunt, Hero Assault (Xbox Live patch only)\nThe Emperor (Empire), Darth Maul (CIS), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Republic), Princess Leia (Rebels)\n-\nPolis Massa\nMedical/Mining Facility\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 2 Flag CTF\nThe Emperor (Empire), Darth Maul (CIS), Princess Leia (Rebels), Yoda (Republic)\n-\nTantive IV\nInterior\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 1 Flag CTF\nDarth Vader (Empire), Princess Leia (Rebels), General Grievous (CIS), Yoda (Republic)\n-\nTatooine\nJabbas Palace\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, 1 Flag CTF\nBoba Fett (Empire), Luke Skywalker (Rebels), Aayla Secura (Republic), Darth Maul (CIS)\n-\nTatooine\nMos Eisley\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, 2 Flag CTF, Hunt, Hero Assault (not available in Galactic Conquest)\nBoba Fett (Empire), Darth Maul (CIS), Han Solo (Rebels), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Republic)\n-\nUtapau\nSinkhole\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 1 Flag CTF\nObi-Wan Kenobi (Republic), General Grievous (CIS), Boba Fett (Empire), Han Solo (Rebels)\n-\nYavin 4\nTemple\nClone Wars, Galactic Civil War\nConquest, Campaign, 1 Flag CTF\nBoba Fett (Empire), Chewbacca (Rebels), Mace Windu (Republic), Darth Maul (CIS)\n\n\u2022 Faction and era-specific maps\n\nSome maps are only available to one era.

Also missing but present on the UMD is an incomplete Rhen Var Citadel map, suggesting that Rhen Var Citadel would have been a PSP exclusive map prior to the Xbox update. Mustafar is also scaled back slightly (it does not include the Control Room or the conference room), although the PSP games successor, Renegade Squadron', uses most of the original Mustafar map.\nAlso present in the game is a unique feature during solo Conquest matches, where AI will become a certain map's hero if the player chooses to spawn as a hero.\nThe ability to damage capital ships' critical systems from the inside, as well as self-manned turrets, is also missing from the game (although internal critical systems can be seen by running alongside a hangar wall while directing the camera against it). Also, the Training, Space Overview, and Rise of the Empire modes are not available. Instead of the campaign mode there is an alternative challenge mode with three different scenarios.\nImperial enforcer &ndash; Players will travel to several planets, in which they must hunt down a set number of natives within a time limit. Locations include Naboo &ndash; Gungans, Mos Eisley &ndash; Jawas, Endor &ndash; Ewoks and their final destination will be Kashyyyk, where they must hunt down fifty Wookiees, they are however allowed one IFT-T. Players begin as a sniper, and their class choices will grow as they venture. Players are aided by Boba Fett.\nRogue Assassin &ndash; Players are a Phase I Jet Trooper, carrying a clone's blaster rifle instead of an EMP launcher. Rogue Assassins must hunt down and kill specific targets, high ranking officers or deserters, in a time limit, on different planets. Planets include Dagobah &ndash; Three Imperial officers, Mygeeto &ndash; Three Imperial officers, Yavin 4 &ndash; Six Clone Commanders (two sets of three), Polis Massa &ndash; Six MagnaGuards (Two sets of three). Players only have one class choice, and the heroes are the Fetts(Jango and Boba).\nRebel Raider &ndash; Players are a Rebel smuggler. They must acquire certain parts within a time limit. Players will travel to Mygeeto to collect three shield generator parts, then to Naboo to receive weaponry plans, then to Hoth to seek out Imperial probe droids, then in space they must land in the imperial hangar and transport goods back. Players are aided by Han Solo.\n\n\u2022 Medals\n\nMedals can be acquired for achieving special requirements in one life, however, players must achieve veteran status (Four medals) of that medal before they can use the award that comes with it. Players lose the medal once they die, but if they die within thirty seconds of acquiring the medal, then the award is available to them in the next life. When Elite status (32 medals) is achieved in a certain area, the requirements to earn a medal in that area are lowered (usually by one-fourth), allowing players to gain legendary status more easily. Once legendary status (sixty-four medals) of that medal is achieved players will automatically get the medal once you start the game.\nThe Endurance medal is acquired after twelve points are earned in one life (nine with Elite status). Energy regeneration is awarded, this increases the speed of which the energy bar used for strenuous actions regenerates.\nThe Guardian medal is awarded after twenty-four points are earned in one life (eighteen with Elite status). Damage Reduction is awarded, which makes enemy fire less damaging to the players.\nThe War Hero medal is awarded after thirty-six points are earned in one life (twenty-seven with Elite status). Increased Damage is awarded, which increases the damage players' weapons do.\nThe Frenzy medal is awarded after twelve kills with a Blaster Rifle in one life (nine with Elite status). The Elite Rifle is the award, which offers a more accurate three round burst firing rifle like Boba Fett's with less ammo.\nThe Demolition medal is awarded after four critical hits on vehicle with a Rocket Launcher are gained in one life (three with Elite status). Remote Rockets are the award, these are guided rockets which home in on the target. This is the only award that does not replace the previous weapon.\nThe Gunslinger medal is awarded after six kills with a Pistol in one life (four with Elite status). A Precision Pistol with greater damage, accuracy, faster rate of fire, and limited ammo is awarded.\nThe Marksman medal is awarded after six head shots with sniper rifle are gained in one life (four with Elite status). The Beam Rifle is the award, which offers a beam that can pass through multiple enemies.\nThe Regulator medal is awarded after eight kills with a Blast Cannon/Shotgun are gained in one life (six with Elite status). The award is a Flechette Shotgun, which is a more powerful shotgun, with more ammo than the regular shotgun.\nThe Technician medal is awarded to players who manage to slice into a vehicle. The Vehicle Regeneration award is given which slowly regenerates the health of the vehicle the player drives next.\nThe more medals they player has earned, the more men can be lead: If twenty medals are earned, players obtain the rank of sergeant and can lead two men; if one hundred are earned, players obtain the rank of captain and can lead three men; and if three hundred medals are earned, players obtain the rank of general and can lead four men.\n\n\u2022 Voice cast\n\n\u2022 Bob Bergen&mdash;Luke Skywalker\n\n\u2022 Christina Rumbley&mdash;Female Alliance Infantry\n\n\u2022 Corey Burton&mdash;Count Dooku; Imperial Officer 2; Ki Adi Mundi\n\n\u2022 Dave Boat&mdash;Republic Infantry\n\n\u2022 David W.

The download includes:\n\n\u2022 New heroes\n\n\u2022 Kit Fisto: A Republic hero who is stronger and more bulky than most of the other heroes. His powers include Saber Throw, Force Water Orb and Force Destruction.\n\n\u2022 Asajj Ventress: A villainess who has fiber-cord linked lightsabers and is the CIS answer to Aayla Secura. Her powers are Starblades and Force Push.\n\n\u2022 Anakin Skywalker: While not actually a new hero, Anakin can be played on the Republic for the first time outside of the campaign. This Anakin is before his descent to the dark side and can only be played on the Yavin 4 Arena map. He has all the same abilities as the Imperial Anakin.\n\n\u2022 New levels\n\n\u2022 Bespin: Cloud City\n\n\u2022 Yavin 4: Arena\n\n\u2022 Rhen Var: Harbor\n\n\u2022 Rhen Var: Citadel\n\nin Battlefront II.]]\nNOTE: These maps are from the first game and, along with the Kashyyyk: Beachhead map, can be played in Hero Assault mode.\n\n\u2022 New modes\n\n\u2022 Rhen Var: Harbor &ndash; Wampa Hunt\n\nWampas (claws) vs. Rebels (All Types)\n\n\u2022 Mod tools\n\nOn February 15, 2006 a 1.1 patch was released for the PC version, which included support for additional maps. The modding tools were subsequently released by LucasArts and Pandemic Studios on February 22, and shipped with nearly everything used to make the game, including the mission files, special effects, fonts, and localizations, unlike its predecessor, BFBuilder, for the original Battlefront game. Sound effects and music used to make the game were not included because of copyright issues,BFBuilder ReadMe although it is possible to import original music and sound effects into the game.\nMap editing in BFBuilder is handled by a program called ZeroEdit, which is used to mold the landscapes, place objects, command posts and vehicle spawn points. Additional scripting is done through LUA files for maps, and ODF (Object Definition Files) files for objects. User-created levels and mods then go through a process called munging, which compiles assets and maps into formats readable by the game, which are then compiled into container files for in-game use. Although the Battlefront II mod tools are subtly different from BFBuilder, assets can be imported from the first into the second, and vice versa.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nBantha poodoo]]\"\n\u2022 Orange frilled mushroom\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\n\u2022 In the Polis Massa level, computer screens show diagrams of the Jedi Archives (these are the same diagrams that were seen in the Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones reference book). Also, the shortcut into Theed Royal Palace from Episode I can be seen.\n\n\u2022 Because Hero Assault Mode is meant mainly to be a \"party mode\", different songs, such as Jedi Rocks, Lapti Nek, Yub Nub, and both Mos Eisley cantina songs play in the background.\n\n\u2022 Although Temuera Morrison voiced Jango Fett, Boba Fett, and the retired clone trooper, he did not voice the clone troopers in-game.\n\n\u2022 Matthew Wood, who provided the voice of General Grievous in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, also voiced the infamous cyborg general in the video game.\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Battlefront II is the top selling Star Wars video game, with over 6,000,000 copies sold.\n\n\u2022 In the PSP version of the game, during the Rebel Raider challenge on Hoth, the Empire controls the remaining Rebel Transport and the Destroyed Shield Generator, while the player controls the Imperial Echo Base, although players play as the Rebels.\n\n\u2022 Through modding, it has been discovered that more campaigns were to be in the game, such as a space battle between the Empire and Anti-Troopers, and even had their own lines for the cutscenes, but were taken out for unknown reasons.\n\n\u2022 It has also been discovered that the cutscenes of the game were to have additional lines, but were also taken out for unknown reasons.\n\n\u2022 During Galactic Civil War Battles, Imperials sometimes whistle The Imperial March and&mdash;though rarely&mdash;may swear during prolonged periods of heated battle, such as this Mustafar battle.\n\n\u2022 During the Naboo Campaign, when the player's objective is to eliminate all of the Jedi, if the player kills a Naboo royal guard, a glitch may occure where it will be counted as a team kill and take away points. However, this glitch is extremely rare.\n\n\u2022 When a B2 super battle droid is blown apart, the flying parts are those of a B1. It is possible that this mistake was a scripting error or simply a choice made by developers to increase the game's efficiency through the use of fewer models and/or files.\n\n\u2022 The instruction manual incorrectly states that the sniper class uses recon droids. In truth, only specific unlockable classes (specifically, the IG-100 MagnaGuard, Clone Commander, Imperial Officer and Wookiee Warrior)have the recon droid in their secondary inventory. This typo may be due to the fact that the sniper class of the original Star Wars: Battlefront were equipped with recon droids. Recon droids may have been carried by the sniper class in an earlier version of the game, but may have been switched with auto-turrets to correct balancing issues.\n\n\u2022 In the intro to the Space Coruscant campaign, the Republic's Hangar Shields are red, when they should be blue.\n\n\u2022 In both the Kashyyyk and Mygeeto intro videos, a B1 Droid with blue markings is seen. This may be because in the original game, Assault Droids were blue instead of red.\n\n\u2022 In several cutscenes for the Empire campaign, such as Naboo and Kamino, an Imperial Engineer from Hoth is seen, despite there not being any in those levels.\n\n\u2022 Aboard the Tantive IV, the screens in the control room show the view of Kamino Obi-Wan saw in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. This is somewhat confusing as there is no canonical mention of the Tantive IV ever visiting Kamino, and the in-game battle appears to be the same action conducted by Vader and the 501st Legion during the opening scenes of A New Hope, thus placing the ship above Tatooine.\n\n\u2022 Also on the Tantive IV, the main view shows elongated stars, even though the ship is actually in the hangar bay of an Imperial Star Destroyer.\n\n\u2022 On the Death Star map, a destructable vent in a hallway on the prison level leads to the trash compactor seen in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. The walls of the trash compactor close in and kill the player.\n\n\u2022 TIE fighters can be seen in the Death Star hangar even during the \"Clone Wars\"-era Death Star battle. The Clone Wars-era battle onboard the Death Star is non-canon, as the Death Star was not completed until years after the end of the Clone Wars.\n\n\u2022 Darth Maul is a playable hero on some Clone Wars-era maps such as Yavin IV and Mustafar, even though he was defeated at least a decade prior to most battles in the game, none of which have him after he reappeared. The clones may say, \"Darth Maul? What's he going to do? Bleed all over us?\" when he is first summoned to the field. Obviously, his appearance is non-canon, due to his natural legs still being attached to his body.\n\n\u2022 Occasionally, a clone will say \"Look out! It's Major Malevolent, uh, General Grievous!\" when the player is playing as General Grievous.\n\n\u2022 If Jango Fett enters the battlefield, clone troopers can occasionally be heard shouting \"Fett's here. And he brought his head!\". This is a reference to Episode II where Jango Fett is beheaded by Mace Windu; needless to say, his role in Battlefront II's Clone Wars-era battles is non-canonical.\n\n\u2022 There is also a possibility that a clone will tell Jango \"Hey, Jango! Can I have your autograph?\" This was obviously placed in there as a comical line, considering many clones didn't think highly of their Separatist-allied template.\n\n\u2022 One of the load screens for the Death Star: Interior map is an obvious screenshot from an earlier version of the game, as the command posts are colored green, while in the final version of the game, friendly command posts are blue. Other loading screens for the game's maps--i.e. the Tantive IV--are similarly taken from the original Battlefront, as they show either older CP color schemes or older character skins.\n\n\u2022 One of the load screens for the Felucia map has Aayla Secura with a blue and purple lightsaber, even on the non-PSP versions of the game. At the Republic ending of the Galactic Conquest, Aayla has her purple lightsaber and a green command post can be seen in the background, possibly meaning that Aayla originally had a purple lightsaber in all versions of the game.\n\n\u2022 In the intro to the Space Kashyyyk campaign, a Clone Pilot is seen falling in space. This can be achieved by taking off and landing quickly on the edge of the hangar and exiting an aircraft, and walking off the ship and into space, although there is gravity and the player will fall instead of being slowly dragged toward the planet.\n\n\u2022 The Hunt mode for Kashyyyk has the Wooden Barricades and Gate Wench for the Wookiees team as the opposite teams structures. This is clearly a glitch and can be annoying if the player is playing as the Wookiees, as they will attack and destroy their own defenses.\n\n\u2022 The heroes Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi have the same lightsaber attack combos, as do Luke Skywalker and Ki-Adi-Mundi (though the latter pair have different dash attacks and Force skills). Also, both pairs play on the same planet during conquest modes (Mustafar and Mygeeto, respectively).\n\n\u2022 On the Death Star map, when playing as Darth Sidious in the Clone Wars era, the clones can be heard shouting things such as \"Surround Palpatine!\" - yet another non-canonical quote by Republic infantry. In reality, the entire clone army was truly under the command of Darth Sidious himself for the duration of the Clone Wars.\n\n\u2022 On Coruscant, Vulture Droid Starfighters can be in the sky, although faintly.\n\n\u2022 In Jabbas palace, if an AI is picked up by the Rancor, that character will spew health and ammo packs when shot. This also happens in Battlefront I with the Sarlacc.\n\n\u2022 There is a glitch with the Award Pistol concerning Han Solo. After this award is earned with the Legendary status, if the player chooses to play as Han Solo in any map (including Mos Eisley Assault), if the player switches to the Fusioncutter, the player will be unable to switch back to the pistol unless they respawn.\n\n\u2022 A similar glitch occurs with the Anti-Trooper in the PSP version of the game - if the player earns Frenzy or Guardian awards, the player will not be able to use the award weapon or the original weapon without respawning.\n\n\u2022 On space maps, if the player lands a starfighter just before it exits or enters a battleship's hangar shield and exits the fighter, it becomes possible to walk around the outer edges of the ship. On certain levels, it is possible to jump down on top of nearby frigates.\n\n\u2022 When playing as The Emperor, the lightsaber is deactivated and hidden unless you press the attack key. When he is finished executing his attack combo, he puts it away again (if you continue to press the attack key, he still puts it away, then immediately takes it out again).\n\n\u2022 When playing as Darth Maul, if the attack button is held down near the end of the attack sequence, he will do an extra twirl of his double-bladed lightsaber. This is an additional attack that will still harm enemies.\n\n\u2022 When playing as the Republic on Geonosis in Galactic Conquest, the clones still have Phase I Armor.\n\n\u2022 Jango Fett carries one Precision Pistol (the award pistol) instead of two WESTAR-34 blaster pistols.\n\n\u2022 Characters can enter the vulture droid and almost all other CIS spaceships as a vehicle; when flying in space, the droid computer's voice will sound at various points even if the pilot is an organic.\n\n\u2022 In the PC instruction manual, on page 13, it shows a picture of Luke Skywalker in his Tatooine outfit from Episode IV (Luke's Tatooine farmer attire), even though you cannot play as Luke in that outfit in the game.\n\n\u2022 During the deactivation of Xbox LIVE for all Xbox Original games, Star Wars: Battlefront II was recognized for having the second largest online community still playing the game prior to the online multiplayer deactivation on April 15, 2010 with the largest being the online community for Halo 2.\n\n\u2022 In the mission, Amongst the Ruins, LAAT dropships are actively used during the battle. However, the models used in the level are the variations for the first Battlefront which use different weapons from their Space Battle counterparts. In addition, Amongst the Ruins, Underground Ambush, and Operation: Knightfall are the only missions to utilize Battlefront I variations of airborne vehicles (which have controls and movements that are scripted to an AI and cannot be commandeered).\n\n\u2022 In the game, the retired clone trooper narrating the campaign encounters every battle from Geonosis to Hoth. However, due to the shortened lifespan of Fett clones, first-generation or especially Spaarti, the last battle this trooper wouldve encountered, at best, would probably have been the battle of Naboo, as the entire campaign was spread over a period of roughly 25 years. This means the trooper wouldve been over 90 human years old due to accelerated aging and still fighting, something impossible. This is also referenced at times when the trooper says things like \"20 years after we were created\" before the clone rebellion on Kamino and \"I'd fought with some of those men for over 20 years\" before the space battle of Yavin. This implies that perhaps some of the troopers of the 501st were given something to prevent accelerated aging and therefore were able to fight in such historic battles as Hoth. This is supported by the fact that other Fett clones appear in the Expanded Universe, some of them years after the Battle of Endor.\n\n\u2022 When playing as Darth Vader, players will notice that he holds his Lightsaber in his right hand. However, when using the dash attack, the strike places the lightsaber in the left hand. This is a glitch as there is no transition of the lightsaber between hands.\n\n\u2022 When playing on Felucia, small pockets in the earth seep toxic red gas. The gas will slowly deteriorate an organic's health, while droids go unharmed.\n\n\u2022 When playing as Han Solo, stormtroopers will say things like \"Dirty Smuggler\" or \"Its Han Solo, and hes shooting first! That's not fair!\"\n\n\u2022 In the game, Aayla Secura uses two lightsabers at once in battle, one blue, and one green (purple in the PSP version). However, in other Star Wars material such as \"The Clone Wars.\" and comic books, she is only seen using one blue lightsaber.\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection adds Hero Assault to all ground-based maps, including Jabba's Palace. Unlike other maps that omit the native species in this mode, the Gamorreans guarding the palace are retained and treated as a separate faction from the playable ones. They will attack both hero and villain indiscriminately, including bounty hunters Jango and Boba Fett, the latter of which Jabba is a regular client of.\n\n\u2022 Differences between the trailer and final game\n\n\u2022 In the Trailer for Star Wars: Battlefront II, theres a clip where a Battle droid is sniping a Gungan on Naboo in the Great Grass Plains, and also a Rebel Vanguard with a Battlefront I Skin on the Death Star. The HUD in these scenes are identical to Battlefront Is HUD. It is possible that this was showing an early version of the Naboo Hunt mode.\n\n\u2022 In the trailer, the Millennium Falcon is seen in a Death Star hangar bay. This scene is not seen in the final version of the game.\n\n\u2022 In the trailer, the Jedi Temple is shown during daytime.\n\n\u2022 The layouts of the hangars of the capital ships are different in the trailer.\n\n\u2022 A different layout for Utapau was shown in in the trailer. This layout was also shown in in-game movies.\n\n\u2022 Ships appeared to be pilotable on planet surface maps in the trailer; however this feature was removed from the final game with the exception of rebel speeders in the Hoth level.\n\n\u2022 The Republic Cruiser in the trailer looks completely different from the game.\n\n\u2022 The voices of the Rebels and Imperials are the same in the trailer as the first Battlefront.\n\n\u2022 The layouts of many maps were changed between the release of the trailer and the final game.\n\n\u2022 Space battles appeared to have more capital ships than the final game, with different layouts for the battles.\n\n\u2022 The trailer shows the beta Geonosis map shown in trailers for the original Star Wars: Battlefront.\n\n\u2022 The interior design of the Star Destroyer hangars in the trailer were designed to resemble the Death Star hangars. However, in the final game, the Star Destroyer hangars were remodeled.\n\n\u2022 The clone trooper in the Mustafar scene uses a different reloading sound effect from the one used in the final version of the game.\n\n\u2022 In one of the Kamino scenes, the sound effect for a firing Commando Pistol was used for a Clone Blaster Rifle.\n\n\u2022 Cut content\n\nThe game has content that was cut but included either with the mod tools or indicated in the game's files:\n\u2022 Voice-overs for two additional heroes, the Emperors Royal Guard and Ben Kenobi.\n\n\u2022 Voice-overs for units using weapons they did not have in the final game, such as the Rebel Marksman dispensing ammo packs or fusion cutters.\n\n\u2022 A second Imperial Officer model wearing its standard-issue uniforms.\n\n\u2022 An Imperial Officer set up to use in a hunt mode.\n\n\u2022 Acklay were supposed to appear as natives on the Conquest version of Felucia.\n\n\u2022 Dialogue for cross-era modes, such as Republic versus the Empire.\n\n\u2022 Infantry Support Platforms were meant to appear in the game.\n\n\u2022 Starfighters forming squadrons was an unfinished and uncompleted feature.\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars Insider 85]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Flash required\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Flash required\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Battlefront II\n\n\u2022",

Wesa warriors.|[[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]]|<ref name=\"Episode I\" />}}\nThe '''Gungans''' were a sentient, [[Amphibian/Legends|amphibious]] [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] race native to the terrestrial [[Planet/Legends|planet]] known as [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. Prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that took place in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], the Gungans were a largely isolationist society. They were able to combine machinery with biology. They lived in large bubble-like domes under water. Gungans had strong leg muscles for swimming and were aided by their long fin-like ears. Their somewhat lanky arms ended in four-fingered hands, and their feet had three stubby toes each. Females tended to be slightly smaller with sleeker faces. They often tied their long ears back.\n\nWhile most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they developed an advanced, albeit unique, technology. They grew the basic structures of buildings, vehicles and technology and adorned them with artistic flourishes and organic lines. This gave Gungan technology a very fluid, non-rectilinear look.\n\nThe power source for Gungan technology was a mysterious blue-white energy \"goo\" that was mined in the depths of Naboo's oceans. The viscous plasmic material formed the basis of Gungan weaponry as well.\n\nThe Gungans had mastered energy field technology for a number of uses. Their underwater cities employed hydrostatic fields to create large bubbles of atmosphere within which they dwell. Similarly, Gungan ground troops carried portable frames which generate a protective energy field capable of deflecting blaster fire. In large-scale combat, giant Gungan shield generators could create an immense umbrella of protective shield energy that could stop laser bolts and physical objects with great kinetic energy.\n\nDespite mastering this bizarre technology, Gungans still employed beasts of burden for transportation. Their most common mount was the [[Kaadu/Legends|kaadu]], a wingless [[Reptavian/Legends|reptavian]] which Gungans adorned with feathers and rode into combat. Other favored Gungan mounts included the large, stubborn [[Falumpaset/Legends|falumpaset]]. For truly heavy loads, the Gungans domesticated the [[Fambaa/Legends|fambaa]], a nine-meter tall, quadrupedal amphibian.\n\nThe Gungans maintained a large standing-armed force called the Gungan Grand Army. This huge collection of foot soldiers carried [[Cesta/Legends|cestas]], electropoles, and [[Atlatl/Legends|atlatls]] capable of hurling plasmic energy spheres (or boomers, as Gungans called them). Gungan catapults hurled even larger boomers over great distances.\n\nThe Gungans were ruled by a Boss and his Rep Council from the High Tower Board Room of Otoh Gunga. The Gungans had an uneasy relationship with the Naboo, the [[Human/Legends|human]] colonists on the planet. Many Naboo looked down upon the Gungans, thinking them as primitive. The Gungans in turn tried to avoid any contact with the surface-dwellers.\n\nIndividuals were called a Gung (eg. [[Gungan Grand Army/Legends|Militiagung]]).\n\n==Biology and appearance==\n{{Quote|There was also a creature who looked like a cross between many species. He stood upright on two legs like a Human. He had a mouth shaped like a bill, and a frog's big eyes rising out of his head. He was not really that unusual compared to some of the creatures who pass through Mos Espa. But I'd never met anyone like him before.|Anakin Skywalker's description of Jar Jar Binks, the first Gungan he ever saw|<ref name=\"Journal: Anakin Skywalker\">''[[Star Wars Journal: Anakin Skywalker]]''</ref>}}\n[[File:GunganFamily-GCG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An Otolla Gungan child]]\nThe Gungans were separated into two races: the lanky orange, yellow or red-skinned '''[[Otolla/Legends|Otolla]]''' race, and the heavier green-skinned '''[[Ankura/Legends|Ankura]]''' race. However, they all exhibited many of the same basic physical traits.\n\nStarting life as [[Tadpole/Legends|tadpoles]], Gungans developed into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allowed for powerful and quick frog-kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called [[Haillu/Legends|haillu]]) also aided them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They had partially retractable [[Ommatophora|eyestalks]] with nictitating membranes when underwater. They also possessed a unique mucus creating organ that helped when being underwater which they use to stop water from entering their nasal passages and mouth. Green eyes were unusual amongst Gungans.<ref name=\"GCG\">''[[Galactic Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:JarJarTongue-BlastOff.png|thumb|right|200px|Jar Jar Binks' long tongue]]\nExpressive faces and long bills with flaring nostrils were signatures of Gungan physiology. Lengthy muscular tongues and large blunt teeth allowed them to eat lesser amphibians, while a layer of tough skin on the head allowed for burrowing. They had 4 stomachs, to better digest shells and vegetation. A Gungan's arms ended in four digits, and their feet had three stubby toes, both unlike that of a human. Females were smaller with sleeker faces and tended to tie their ears back. Females Gungans with light-colored ear flaps were considered very attractive by male Gungans, while the ones with dark-colored haillu were thought of as 'boyish'.<ref name=\"GCG\" /> As male Gungans aged, some, like [[Roos Tarpals/Legends|Roos Tarpals]], developed prominent whiskers. Both sexes had a lifespan of roughly 65 galactic standard years.<ref name=\"UAA\">''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''</ref>\n\nGungans had nostrils that sealed when they entered the [[Water/Legends|water]]. They also boasted very strong compound lungs, allowing them to both hold their breath for extended periods of time, breathe underwater, and withstand the pressure of deep water, along with well-padded kneecaps and powerful calves and legs for increased swimming speed. However, because they were so well-adapted to their watery environment, their skin dried easily in hot and arid climates, which [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]] experienced during his visit to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].\n\nThe Gungans appeared to be related to the [[Glurrg]]s, whom they used as a worker caste in their society.\n\nGungans were detailed in the [[Republic Xenosociological Database]], under Subdirectory ORT831-23,794,928/1N.<ref name=\"SoN\">''[[Secrets of Naboo]]''</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n{{Quote|My warning you, Gungans no liken outsiders, so don't spect a warm welcome.|Jar Jar Binks|<ref name=\"Episode I\" />}}\n[[File:Gungan_High_Council.png|thumb|left|250px|The High Council was the leading body of the Gungan society.]]\nLong ago, explorers on Naboo discovered the [[Gung Slabs]], a set of ancient stones engraved with [[Olys Corellisi/Legends|Olys Corellisi]] on one side and [[Old Gungan/Legends|Old Gungan]] on the reverse. These relics, coupled with the work of philologist [[Burro Flats]] of the [[Baobab Archives]], helped [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] to better understand the culture and language of the Gungan people.\n\nGungans spoke a variation of Basic known as [[Gungan (language)|Gungan Basic]], or \"Gunganese,\" which occasionally incorporated elements of [[Old Gungan/Legends|Old Gungan]], a language spoken during the time of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]]. In fact, the [[Gung Slabs]], a series of ancient monoliths, were essential for the translation of Old Gungan. The Slabs, coupled with the work of philologist [[Burro Flats]] of the [[Baobab Archives]], helped the galaxy to better understand the culture and language of the Gungan people.<ref name=\"phrasebook\">[[Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide (real-life book)|''Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide'']]</ref> Few Gungans were able to speak the pure Gungan language.<ref name=\"TPMV\">''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary]]'' {{C|\"Jar Jar Binks\"}}</ref>\n\nThe later Gungan language was largely a pidgin dialect that most users fluent in [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] could understand. [[Gungan (language)|Gunganese]], as it was commonly referred to, combined slightly-altered Basic words with the occasional Old Gungan term (i.e. \"Seeks doopeewees isa berry good\" is translated as \"Six landspeeders are very good.\")\n\nUtilizing their own unique phraseology, Gungans established a rather successful history of scholarly excellence, albeit unknown to the galaxy at large. Among their achievements include the epic poem ''[[Das Depu Epu Sea]]'', or ''Deep Dark Water''. This ode to [[Da Beauty Al' Round]] was a source of great pride to these noble beings.\n\n[[File:Gungan_society.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Otoh Gunga/Legends|Otoh Gunga]] was the largest Gungan city, home to millions of Gungans and a symbol of their society's unity and strength.]]\nGungan alpha-males often exhibited a series of oral clicks when aggravated or angered. The Gungan [[Gungan Grand Army/Legends|military]] was made up of mostly male volunteers.\n\nGungans were generally a generous and peaceful race until the Trade Federation invaded. They truly loved to have visitors and warmly welcomed them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors had earned their respect.\n\nGungans were not tolerant of anyone who threatened their peaceful culture. They had very strict laws, and would go to the extremes to punish anyone who had committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, could be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.\n\nIf a Gungan was cast out of society, it was very difficult for them to return. If they did manage to return legally, they would often be subjected to heavy discrimination. This could make life very difficult for them and could go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappeared from memory. In addition, returning back illegally to the settlement from which they were exiled would sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders. It usually required a significant deed to not only have their exile revoked, but also to be welcomed back to the fold, such as the time when Jar Jar Binks, due to his actions in uniting the Gungans and Naboo together to fight the Trade Federation, had his exile revoked and promoted to Bombad General by Boss Rugor Nass.\n\nGungans were also known to produce [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] children and the Gungans [[Kin-Ya Dosun]] and [[Kosa-Yin Hadu]] served as members of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]],<ref name=\"TKAAG\">{{LivingForce|Almas, Sweet Almas: The Kaluthin Are Always Greener}}</ref> while the Gungan child [[Roo-Roo Page/Legends|Roo-Roo Page]] was considered as a candidate to receive [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]].<ref name=\"Children of the Force\">{{TCW|Children of the Force}}</ref> The Gungans relied on the semi-sentient mollusk [[Kresch]] for much of their knowledge on matters as varied as Gungan civilization and the fauna of [[Ohma-D'un/Legends|Ohma-D'un]]. The Kresch was consulted by Gungans as an encyclopedia of sorts.<ref name=\"frontier\">[[Star Wars Episode I: The Gungan Frontier|''Star Wars'' Episode I: ''The Gungan Frontier'']]</ref>\n\nGungans also organized yearly the [[Festival of Warriors]], in which [[Militiagung/Legends|Militiagungs]] gathered to celebrate the Gungan's militaristic culture.

Most of their transportation were beasts, although there were some biomechanical constructs in one of their heavy weapons. Their vehicles are generally named after native fauna within the Naboo wetlands.\n\n==History==\nAt some point in Galactic history, there was at least one Otolla Gungan who was a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]].<ref name=\"SWGS6\">{{Topps|set=2011 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 6}}</ref>\n\nThe Gungans were believed to be indigenous to Naboo, but this is uncertain. Biologists believe the Gungans, wherever their original home, evolved originally as land-dwellers.\n\nOn Naboo, evidence of Gungan habitation extended for ages, as there are records of battles of survival with the [[woolly veermok]]s during an ice age. However, the primary reason they developed warfare technology was the threat of the [[Bursa/Legends|bursas]] that often attacked their settlements. The Gungans assembled a \"Grand Army\" to meet this threat, eventually driving the bursas into extinction. Their technology was peculiar in that everything, from tools to structures is not constructed, but \"grown\", each device being therefore organically unique.\n\nAncient starfarers told tales of great Gungan migrations across the plains of Naboo prior to their shift to more aquatic environments. The reason most commonly accepted for their flight to the water revolves around an alien civilization of reptilian humanoids remembered as the \"[[Elders (Naboo)/Legends|Elders]],\" who colonized Naboo. They engaged in warfare with the Gungans, forcing them to retreat underwater, giving rise to modern Gungan civilization. Undoubtedly, the presence of healthful underwater plants and tasty [[gumfish]] did much to solidify their change in lifestyle.\n\n[[File:StimArmor-SWGTCGAoD.jpg|thumb|left|220px|An [[Otolla/Legends|Otolla]] Gungan being assaulted by an Imperial trooper.]]\nThe Ankura and Otolla branches of Gungans united, forming a symbiotic relationship. They dominated Naboo for millennia afterwards, though largely keeping to the swamps and waterways; the mountains and grasslands were considered 'desert-like'.\n\nAbout [[3000 BBY]],<ref name=\"TEA\" /> Gungans were separated in tribes that fought against each other ([[War of the Gungan tribes]]), until united under [[Boss/Legends|Boss]] [[Gallo/Legends|Gallo]]. Gungans from various cities migrated to a new large city, [[Otoh Gunga/Legends|Otoh Gunga]], which was the major and capital city of Naboo (as far as Gungans were concerned).\n\nAround five hundred years before the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]], a number of needy Gungan locals were approached by recruiters sent by [[Hugo Bartyn]]. Bartyn wanted amphibian fishermen to settle a new city in [[Lamaredd/Legends|Lamaredd]] and tempted these poverty-stricken individuals with promises of untouched seas in a new frontier. Once they arrived, however, they became [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] laborers.<ref name=\"BL\">{{GamerCite|7|Bartyn's Landing (article)}}</ref>\n\nThe Gungans and the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Human inhabitants of Naboo]] did not get along, as the Gungans believed the Naboo to be pompous cowards while the Naboo believed the Gungans to be barbarians. This attitude lasted until [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Amidala]] united the Gungans and Naboo to fight the [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] in the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]]. Gungans, over the millennia of [[Human/Legends|Human]] presence, have developed their own dialect based on their [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|language]], called [[Gungan (language)|Gungan Basic]].\n\nAfter the Battle of Naboo, the Gungans attained representation in the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] through Representative [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]]. The Gungans also colonized the moon of [[Ohma-D'un/Legends|Ohma-D'un]], due to overcrowding on Naboo. A number of [[Rorgungans|extremist Gungans]] colonized Naboo's other moon, [[Rori/Legends|Rori]], at about the same time. During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|CIS]] biological weapon known as the \"[[Swamp gas]]\" was unleashed on Ohma-D'un and wiped out much of the population. Later, a Jedi task force defeated the CIS forces on the moon during the [[Battle of Ohma-D'un]], thus saving Naboo.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the newly formed [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] established a presence on Naboo. Fearing enslavement, the Gungans went into semi-seclusion. However, Gungan resistance fighters fought a number of [[Imperial vs. Gungan Battle|clashes]] with Imperial forces. At least one Gungan worked on the nearby [[Rori Space Station]].<ref name=\"SWG\" /> After the Empire's defeat at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], the Gungans and the Humans of Naboo banded together once more to oust the Imperial presence from their world, reclaiming the world as free for both species. As a result, the species began traveling in much larger numbers, across Naboo and the galaxy.<ref name=\":TWOSW:AFG\">''[[The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide]]''</ref>\n\n===Gungans in the galaxy===\n[[File:Gungan_Sith_Galaxy_SWGS6.jpg|thumb|right|160px|An unidentified Otolla Gungan Sith]]\nGungans in Lamaredd achieved certain renown as the co-engineers, along with the [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]], of the popular [[gondola skimmersub]].

    "plain_text": "Gungan\n1\nGungan Basic]] later\nJar Jar Binks]]\nThe Gungans were a sentient, amphibious humanoid race native to the terrestrial planet known as Naboo. Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, an event that took place in 32 BBY, the Gungans were a largely isolationist society. They were able to combine machinery with biology. They lived in large bubble-like domes under water. Gungans had strong leg muscles for swimming and were aided by their long fin-like ears. Their somewhat lanky arms ended in four-fingered hands, and their feet had three stubby toes each. Females tended to be slightly smaller with sleeker faces. They often tied their long ears back.\nWhile most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they developed an advanced, albeit unique, technology. They grew the basic structures of buildings, vehicles and technology and adorned them with artistic flourishes and organic lines. This gave Gungan technology a very fluid, non-rectilinear look.\nThe power source for Gungan technology was a mysterious blue-white energy \"goo\" that was mined in the depths of Naboo's oceans. The viscous plasmic material formed the basis of Gungan weaponry as well.\nThe Gungans had mastered energy field technology for a number of uses. Their underwater cities employed hydrostatic fields to create large bubbles of atmosphere within which they dwell. Similarly, Gungan ground troops carried portable frames which generate a protective energy field capable of deflecting blaster fire. In large-scale combat, giant Gungan shield generators could create an immense umbrella of protective shield energy that could stop laser bolts and physical objects with great kinetic energy.\nDespite mastering this bizarre technology, Gungans still employed beasts of burden for transportation. Their most common mount was the kaadu, a wingless reptavian which Gungans adorned with feathers and rode into combat. Other favored Gungan mounts included the large, stubborn falumpaset. For truly heavy loads, the Gungans domesticated the fambaa, a nine-meter tall, quadrupedal amphibian.\nThe Gungans maintained a large standing-armed force called the Gungan Grand Army. This huge collection of foot soldiers carried cestas, electropoles, and atlatls capable of hurling plasmic energy spheres (or boomers, as Gungans called them). Gungan catapults hurled even larger boomers over great distances.\nThe Gungans were ruled by a Boss and his Rep Council from the High Tower Board Room of Otoh Gunga. The Gungans had an uneasy relationship with the Naboo, the human colonists on the planet. Many Naboo looked down upon the Gungans, thinking them as primitive. The Gungans in turn tried to avoid any contact with the surface-dwellers.\nIndividuals were called a Gung (eg. Militiagung).\n\n\u2022 Biology and appearance\n\nStar Wars Journal: Anakin Skywalker'\nThe Gungans were separated into two races: the lanky orange, yellow or red-skinned Otolla race, and the heavier green-skinned Ankura race. However, they all exhibited many of the same basic physical traits.\nStarting life as tadpoles, Gungans developed into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allowed for powerful and quick frog-kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aided them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They had partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. They also possessed a unique mucus creating organ that helped when being underwater which they use to stop water from entering their nasal passages and mouth. Green eyes were unusual amongst Gungans.Galactic Campaign Guide\nExpressive faces and long bills with flaring nostrils were signatures of Gungan physiology. Lengthy muscular tongues and large blunt teeth allowed them to eat lesser amphibians, while a layer of tough skin on the head allowed for burrowing. They had 4 stomachs, to better digest shells and vegetation. A Gungans arms ended in four digits, and their feet had three stubby toes, both unlike that of a human. Females were smaller with sleeker faces and tended to tie their ears back. Females Gungans with light-colored ear flaps were considered very attractive by male Gungans, while the ones with dark-colored haillu were thought of as boyish. As male Gungans aged, some, like Roos Tarpals, developed prominent whiskers. Both sexes had a lifespan of roughly 65 galactic standard years.Ultimate Alien Anthology'\nGungans had nostrils that sealed when they entered the water. They also boasted very strong compound lungs, allowing them to both hold their breath for extended periods of time, breathe underwater, and withstand the pressure of deep water, along with well-padded kneecaps and powerful calves and legs for increased swimming speed. However, because they were so well-adapted to their watery environment, their skin dried easily in hot and arid climates, which Jar Jar Binks experienced during his visit to Tatooine.\nThe Gungans appeared to be related to the Glurrgs, whom they used as a worker caste in their society.\nGungans were detailed in the Republic Xenosociological Database, under Subdirectory ORT831-23,794,928/1N.Secrets of Naboo\n\n\u2022 Society and culture\n\nJar Jar Binks\nLong ago, explorers on Naboo discovered the Gung Slabs, a set of ancient stones engraved with Olys Corellisi on one side and Old Gungan on the reverse. These relics, coupled with the work of philologist Burro Flats of the Baobab Archives, helped the galaxy to better understand the culture and language of the Gungan people.\nGungans spoke a variation of Basic known as Gungan Basic, or \"Gunganese,\" which occasionally incorporated elements of Old Gungan, a language spoken during the time of the Old Republic. In fact, the Gung Slabs, a series of ancient monoliths, were essential for the translation of Old Gungan. The Slabs, coupled with the work of philologist Burro Flats of the Baobab Archives, helped the galaxy to better understand the culture and language of the Gungan people.Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide Few Gungans were able to speak the pure Gungan language.Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary \"Jar Jar Binks\"\nThe later Gungan language was largely a pidgin dialect that most users fluent in Basic could understand. Gunganese, as it was commonly referred to, combined slightly-altered Basic words with the occasional Old Gungan term (i.e. \"Seeks doopeewees isa berry good\" is translated as \"Six landspeeders are very good.\")\nUtilizing their own unique phraseology, Gungans established a rather successful history of scholarly excellence, albeit unknown to the galaxy at large. Among their achievements include the epic poem Das Depu Epu Sea, or Deep Dark Water. This ode to Da Beauty Al' Round was a source of great pride to these noble beings.\nwas the largest Gungan city, home to millions of Gungans and a symbol of their society's unity and strength.]]\nGungan alpha-males often exhibited a series of oral clicks when aggravated or angered. The Gungan military was made up of mostly male volunteers.\nGungans were generally a generous and peaceful race until the Trade Federation invaded. They truly loved to have visitors and warmly welcomed them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors had earned their respect.\nGungans were not tolerant of anyone who threatened their peaceful culture. They had very strict laws, and would go to the extremes to punish anyone who had committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, could be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.\nIf a Gungan was cast out of society, it was very difficult for them to return. If they did manage to return legally, they would often be subjected to heavy discrimination. This could make life very difficult for them and could go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappeared from memory. In addition, returning back illegally to the settlement from which they were exiled would sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders. It usually required a significant deed to not only have their exile revoked, but also to be welcomed back to the fold, such as the time when Jar Jar Binks, due to his actions in uniting the Gungans and Naboo together to fight the Trade Federation, had his exile revoked and promoted to Bombad General by Boss Rugor Nass.\nGungans were also known to produce Force-sensitive children and the Gungans Kin-Ya Dosun and Kosa-Yin Hadu served as members of the Jedi Order,Almas, Sweet Almas: The Kaluthin Are Always Greener while the Gungan child Roo-Roo Page was considered as a candidate to receive Jedi training.Children of the Force The Gungans relied on the semi-sentient mollusk Kresch for much of their knowledge on matters as varied as Gungan civilization and the fauna of Ohma-Dun. The Kresch was consulted by Gungans as an encyclopedia of sorts.Star Wars Episode I: The Gungan Frontier\nGungans also organized yearly the Festival of Warriors, in which Militiagungs gathered to celebrate the Gungan's militaristic culture. An arena was scheduled for construction in Lake Umberbool for the festivity.10\n\n\u2022 Religion\n\nQui-Gon Jinn]]\nGungans were known to venerate certain deities exclusive to their culture known as guds, such as Mekamok, Wamka Pol, Balmtop, Dobbis, Kobble, Nododo, Balam, Gobba, and their chief god, Oma-Oma.Star Wars: Galactic BattlegroundsMany of these deities were mentioned in the French edition of the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, in the database entry pertaining to the Gungan society, but not in the English version of the entry. By 1 ABY, the fundamentalist sect of the Ultragungans was active on Naboo. This cult was responsible for stealing an artifact from Boss Rugor Nass, later retrieved by a spacer hired by the Boss.\n\n\u2022 Military\n\nMain Article: Gungan Grand Army\nThe Gungans possessed a large military force, known as the Gungan Grand Army. Most of their transportation were beasts, although there were some biomechanical constructs in one of their heavy weapons. Their vehicles are generally named after native fauna within the Naboo wetlands.\n\n\u2022 History\n\nAt some point in Galactic history, there was at least one Otolla Gungan who was a Sith.\nThe Gungans were believed to be indigenous to Naboo, but this is uncertain. Biologists believe the Gungans, wherever their original home, evolved originally as land-dwellers.\nOn Naboo, evidence of Gungan habitation extended for ages, as there are records of battles of survival with the woolly veermoks during an ice age. However, the primary reason they developed warfare technology was the threat of the bursas that often attacked their settlements. The Gungans assembled a \"Grand Army\" to meet this threat, eventually driving the bursas into extinction. Their technology was peculiar in that everything, from tools to structures is not constructed, but \"grown\", each device being therefore organically unique.\nAncient starfarers told tales of great Gungan migrations across the plains of Naboo prior to their shift to more aquatic environments. The reason most commonly accepted for their flight to the water revolves around an alien civilization of reptilian humanoids remembered as the \"Elders,\" who colonized Naboo. They engaged in warfare with the Gungans, forcing them to retreat underwater, giving rise to modern Gungan civilization. Undoubtedly, the presence of healthful underwater plants and tasty gumfish did much to solidify their change in lifestyle.\nGungan being assaulted by an Imperial trooper.]]\nThe Ankura and Otolla branches of Gungans united, forming a symbiotic relationship. They dominated Naboo for millennia afterwards, though largely keeping to the swamps and waterways; the mountains and grasslands were considered desert-like.\nAbout 3000 BBY, Gungans were separated in tribes that fought against each other (War of the Gungan tribes), until united under Boss Gallo. Gungans from various cities migrated to a new large city, Otoh Gunga, which was the major and capital city of Naboo (as far as Gungans were concerned).\nAround five hundred years before the Battle of Naboo, a number of needy Gungan locals were approached by recruiters sent by Hugo Bartyn. Bartyn wanted amphibian fishermen to settle a new city in Lamaredd and tempted these poverty-stricken individuals with promises of untouched seas in a new frontier. Once they arrived, however, they became slave laborers.\nThe Gungans and the Human inhabitants of Naboo did not get along, as the Gungans believed the Naboo to be pompous cowards while the Naboo believed the Gungans to be barbarians. This attitude lasted until Queen Amidala united the Gungans and Naboo to fight the Trade Federation in the Battle of Naboo. Gungans, over the millennia of Human presence, have developed their own dialect based on their language, called Gungan Basic.\nAfter the Battle of Naboo, the Gungans attained representation in the Galactic Republic Senate through Representative Jar Jar Binks. The Gungans also colonized the moon of Ohma-Dun, due to overcrowding on Naboo. A number of extremist Gungans colonized Naboos other moon, Rori, at about the same time. During the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, a CIS biological weapon known as the \"Swamp gas\" was unleashed on Ohma-Dun and wiped out much of the population. Later, a Jedi task force defeated the CIS forces on the moon during the Battle of Ohma-D'un, thus saving Naboo.\nFollowing the end of the war, the newly formed Galactic Empire established a presence on Naboo. Fearing enslavement, the Gungans went into semi-seclusion. However, Gungan resistance fighters fought a number of clashes with Imperial forces. At least one Gungan worked on the nearby Rori Space Station. After the Empires defeat at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Gungans and the Humans of Naboo banded together once more to oust the Imperial presence from their world, reclaiming the world as free for both species. As a result, the species began traveling in much larger numbers, across Naboo and the galaxy.The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide'\n\n\u2022 Gungans in the galaxy\n\nGungans in Lamaredd achieved certain renown as the co-engineers, along with the Quarren, of the popular gondola skimmersub. Other Gungans that succeeded in that planet were Bamfurd, a tapcafe owner in Bartyns Landing; Boom Boom, the Security Chiefs Second; and The Mighty Musstoro, an Akura wrestler.\nThey also jointly operated the Dorumaa Resort on Dorumaas moon.Living Force Campaign Guide'\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nStar Wars: Tiny Death Star\nAccording to an interview with George Lucas, the name \"Gungan\" came from his son Jett's name for tractors and trucks.\nGungans were partially modeled after hadrosaurs, duck-billed dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period.\nThe word \"Gungan\" can also refer to any member of an Australian genus of frogs, Uperoleia.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nLegacy (2006) 14]]\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 Force Fiction\n\n\u2022 The Emperor's Court\n\n\u2022 Failing Up With Jar Jar Binks\n\n\u2022 George R.

Along with speed, your speciality is concealment.|[[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]|<ref name=\"Star Wars (radio)\">[[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]]</ref>}}\n[[File:DynamicDuo-Chewbacca4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Famous smuggler duo Han Solo and Chewbacca, with their ship, the ''Millennium Falcon'']]\nBy far the most commonly smuggled substances were varieties of [[Spice/Legends|spice]]. Although most kinds of spice were psychoactive drugs, and most forms were illegal under the Empire, the government's main concern was not to stem the flow of spice, but to collect taxes from its shipment and distribution through legitimate channels. Weapons were another commonly smuggled commodity within the Empire, whose bureaucracy strictly controlled weapons availability in order to prevent criminals and insurgents, in particular the Rebel Alliance, from becoming significant threats. Other cargo for smugglers included [[Chak-root/Legends|chak-root]], stolen merchandise, and even clear water (smuggled to [[Rampa III]]). In extreme situations, smugglers delivered standard resources or food; for example, on [[Abregado-rae/Legends|Abregado-rae]], smugglers supplied Separatists after a new regime stopped all food transports to the Separatists in the mountains in hopes of stamping out opposition. During his time as a smuggler, Jolee Bindo stole from the rich and smuggled in the stolen goods to the people of the Ukatis system, due to the blockade imposed by its own king. Some smugglers, such as [[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax Terrik]], specialized in finding rare and sometimes illegal goods or artifacts and delivering them to their clients who hoped to avoid using \"official means.\" In addition, sometimes live droids were smuggled through areas such as transport terminals, including that of the space station belonging to the Star Tours interstellar travel agency, with success largely because of [[G2-9T/Legends|G2-9T]], the security droid responsible for baggage checks, being incompetent at his job.<ref name=\"ST2\">''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]''</ref>\n\n==Stance==\n[[File:Smuggling_compartments.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Many [[Starship/Legends|ships]] contained smuggling compartments.]]\nA common stereotype in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] was that smugglers were usually [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]], and indeed, there were no shortages of Corellian smugglers, but smuggling was carried out by various freight carriers and criminal organizations of all species and planetary origins. Even members of the Imperial bureaucracy and military establishment had their own smuggling organizations, while other smugglers (such as [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]] of Black Sun) were important players in legitimate galactic business. Fringe elements like the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] established large networks dedicated to evading Imperial forces within the galaxy. Another set of major players in illegal trade were the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Kajidic/Legends|Kajidics]], vast criminal organizations based around the clan structure of the Hutts. The Hutts controlled a [[Hutt Space/Legends|region]] of the galaxy in the [[Mid Rim/Legends|Mid]] and [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] which maintained independence from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], and later great autonomy within the Empire; this allowed them to recruit [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] and buy ships for use in smuggling with a minimum of scrutiny, while possessing safe locations for their pilots to use. Some planets were controlled by the Hutts but nominally within the Imperial sphere of influence, such as [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], which provided excellent locations to secretly funnel shipments, pilots, and supplies into Imperial space without arousing suspicion.\n\n==Common problems for smugglers==\n[[File:Contraband_by_Alejandro-Mirabal.png|thumb|right|180px|A smuggler being controlled by an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] patrol]]\n{{Quote|Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra.|[[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]|<ref name=\"Episode 4\">{{Film|IV}}</ref>}}\nSmugglers had to worry about attacks from [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] and opportunists who would attempt to steal their cargo, meaning that smugglers needed to avoid some of the most lawless [[Star system/Legends|star systems]] to remain safe. Also, because they were smuggling contraband, they had no hope of help from Imperial/Republic forces and could not seek the protection of the galactic authorities. Most smugglers developed keen skills to avoid trouble, and they modified their ships not only for better cargo capacity, but also for greater speed and defenses. In order to evade Imperial patrols, smugglers often used smaller and less well-known [[Hyperspace route/Legends|routes]] that skirted Imperial strong points within the galaxy. There were many of these smuggling routes, and every smuggler usually had his or her preferred ways of getting from place to place safely. Despite their precautions, many smugglers ended their career on prison worlds such as [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] or [[Akrit'tar/Legends|Akrit'tar]]. Many smugglers were also killed during their runs&mdash;some even committed [[Death/Legends|suicide]] to avoid being arrested and sentenced.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe \"Smuggler\" was one of the original twenty-four character templates used by the ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'', first published in the [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game (first edition)|first edition rulebook]].<ref name=\"RPG\">[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game (first edition)|''Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game'']]</ref>\n\nThe smuggler is one of the classes in the video game ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' and later used for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in the video game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n[[File:Mara_DSSB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mara Jade became a smuggler after the fall of the Empire.]]\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of

    "plain_text": "Heir to the Empire\nA smuggler, also known by the euphemism free trader, was someone who engaged in the clandestine shipment of goods or people to prevent taxation or some other impediment. The goods shipped were often highly illegal or banned in some sectors. Weapon smugglers were referred to as gun runners.\n\n\u2022 Profession\n\nRebel Dawn'\n]]\nSmuggling, while a part of galactic trade for many years in the Galactic Republic, absolutely thrived under the Galactic Empires strict control of goods. The nationalization of former Separatist companies assets, including their vast merchant fleets, greatly increased smuggling's appeal\u2014and demand. By 3 ABY, smuggling had become so common that Imperial officers often looked the other way if they found a smuggling outfit. For example, Admiral Kendal Ozzel, dismissed the Rebel outpost Echo Base on Hoth as a smuggling operation when reports of its location arrived from an Arakyd Viper probe droid. The fact that many smugglers operated in support of the Rebellion and channeled funds to them made such distinctions even more difficult.\n\n\u2022 Smuggled goods\n\nStar Wars' radio drama]]\nBy far the most commonly smuggled substances were varieties of spice. Although most kinds of spice were psychoactive drugs, and most forms were illegal under the Empire, the governments main concern was not to stem the flow of spice, but to collect taxes from its shipment and distribution through legitimate channels. Weapons were another commonly smuggled commodity within the Empire, whose bureaucracy strictly controlled weapons availability in order to prevent criminals and insurgents, in particular the Rebel Alliance, from becoming significant threats. Other cargo for smugglers included chak-root, stolen merchandise, and even clear water (smuggled to Rampa III). In extreme situations, smugglers delivered standard resources or food; for example, on Abregado-rae, smugglers supplied Separatists after a new regime stopped all food transports to the Separatists in the mountains in hopes of stamping out opposition. During his time as a smuggler, Jolee Bindo stole from the rich and smuggled in the stolen goods to the people of the Ukatis system, due to the blockade imposed by its own king. Some smugglers, such as Mirax Terrik, specialized in finding rare and sometimes illegal goods or artifacts and delivering them to their clients who hoped to avoid using \"official means.\" In addition, sometimes live droids were smuggled through areas such as transport terminals, including that of the space station belonging to the Star Tours interstellar travel agency, with success largely because of G2-9T, the security droid responsible for baggage checks, being incompetent at his job.Star Tours: The Adventures Continue'\n\n\u2022 Stance\n\ncontained smuggling compartments.]]\nA common stereotype in the galaxy was that smugglers were usually Corellian, and indeed, there were no shortages of Corellian smugglers, but smuggling was carried out by various freight carriers and criminal organizations of all species and planetary origins. Even members of the Imperial bureaucracy and military establishment had their own smuggling organizations, while other smugglers (such as Prince Xizor of Black Sun) were important players in legitimate galactic business. Fringe elements like the Black Sun established large networks dedicated to evading Imperial forces within the galaxy. Another set of major players in illegal trade were the Hutt Kajidics, vast criminal organizations based around the clan structure of the Hutts. The Hutts controlled a region of the galaxy in the Mid and Outer Rim which maintained independence from the Galactic Republic, and later great autonomy within the Empire; this allowed them to recruit pilots and buy ships for use in smuggling with a minimum of scrutiny, while possessing safe locations for their pilots to use. Some planets were controlled by the Hutts but nominally within the Imperial sphere of influence, such as Tatooine, which provided excellent locations to secretly funnel shipments, pilots, and supplies into Imperial space without arousing suspicion.\n\n\u2022 Common problems for smugglers\n\npatrol]]\nIV\nSmugglers had to worry about attacks from pirates and opportunists who would attempt to steal their cargo, meaning that smugglers needed to avoid some of the most lawless star systems to remain safe. Also, because they were smuggling contraband, they had no hope of help from Imperial/Republic forces and could not seek the protection of the galactic authorities. Most smugglers developed keen skills to avoid trouble, and they modified their ships not only for better cargo capacity, but also for greater speed and defenses. In order to evade Imperial patrols, smugglers often used smaller and less well-known routes that skirted Imperial strong points within the galaxy. There were many of these smuggling routes, and every smuggler usually had his or her preferred ways of getting from place to place safely. Despite their precautions, many smugglers ended their career on prison worlds such as Kessel or Akrittar. Many smugglers were also killed during their runs&mdash;some even committed suicide to avoid being arrested and sentenced.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe \"Smuggler\" was one of the original twenty-four character templates used by the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, first published in the first edition rulebook.Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game\nThe smuggler is one of the classes in the video game Star Wars Galaxies and later used for the Galactic Republic in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nStar Wars (1977) 108]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The Kaal Connection\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Heroes Need Not Apply\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Missed Chance\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Rogue Squadron X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: The Krytos Trap X-Wing: The Krytos Trap (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: The Bacta War X-Wing: The Bacta War (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Big Quince (short story)\n\n\u2022 Vengeance Strike\n\n\u2022 Kella Rand, Reporting...\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Wraith Squadron X-Wing: Wraith Squadron (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Solo Command X-Wing: Solo Command (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 First Contact\n\n\u2022 Heir to the Empire Heir to the Empire (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Dark Force Rising Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 The Last Command The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Relic (article)\n\n\u2022 Counterstrike (Adventure Journal)\n\n\u2022 Rendezvous with Destiny\n\n\u2022 Betrayal by Knight\n\n\u2022 Retreat from Coruscant\n\n\u2022 Firestorm (short story)\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar\n\n\u2022 Murder in Slushtime\n\n\u2022 Tyrant's Test\n\n\u2022 The New Rebellion\n\n\u2022 Specter of the Past Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Vision of the Future Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Young Jedi Knights: Heirs of the Force\n\n\u2022 Young Jedi Knights: Shadow Academy\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\n\n\u2022 Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen\n\n\u2022 Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Exile\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Omen Fate of the Jedi: Omen (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Conviction Fate of the Jedi: Conviction (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 A Wookiee Scorned!\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\u2022 LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\n\n\u2022 Bantha Shakes\n\n\u2022 Jedi Academy: Return of the Padawan\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStay on Target]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Lords of Nal Hutta\n\n\u2022 Fly Casual\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Strongholds of Resistance\n\n\u2022 Keeping the Peace\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Smuggler",

George Lucas first announced the series at 2005s Celebration III. Over the next few years, a variety of writers were hired, over fifty scripts were written and art designers worked on visualizing Lucas ideas. However, in 2010, Lucas announced that the series was on hold due to budget constraints.\n\n\u2022 Plot summary\n\nArchived here]]\nStar Wars: Underworld is said to be set primarily in the Coruscant Underworld (which was briefly glimpsed during Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones), in the time period between Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. It is during this period that the Galactic Empire rises to ultimate power throughout the galaxy. In 2005, George Lucas told Celebration III audiences that the show would not focus on any characters from the films, but that some of them could appear; \"A lot of the issues from the films are connected, but you wont necessarily see a lot of the people that are connected.\" He later described the show as \"bare-bones\" and \"action-heavy,\" and explained that it would depict what the inhabitants of the Star Wars' galaxy do for entertainment.\nProducer Rick McCallum commented on the plot of the series: \"[Lucas] envisions somewhere like 100 hours between Episode III and Episode IV with a lot of characters that we havent met that have been developed in some of the novels and other things. We are really excited about that. Finally, we could have the opportunity to answer everybodys questions once and for all by the time we finish the series.\"; \"It is going to be much darker, grittier. Its much more character-based\"; \"Think about bounty hunter, thats all I can tell you.\" He also called it \"Deadwood in space\" and \"Empire on steroids,\" and compared it to The Godfather. Lucasfilms Stephen J. Sansweet also described the series as revealing the \"greasy, seamy underbelly of Star Wars.\" Writer Ronald D. Moore said that it wouldve generally followed one overarching story, and described it as \"...lots of action, lots of sets, and huge set pieces. Just much bigger than what you would normally do in a television show.\"\nAccording to Dan Wasson, project leader for the Wii version of the Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, the TV series may contain elements from the overall Star Wars: The Force Unleashed multimedia project. In 2014, Stephen Scaia revealed in his Kickstarter campaign that he had been a writer for the series, and was involved in several story elements, including Lando Calrissian losing the Millennium Falcon to Han Solo, Solo and Chewbacca's first meeting, as well as an action scene with Boba Fett.\n\n\u2022 Cast and characters\n\nStephen Scaia\nThe series was expected to feature minor characters from both the films and the Expanded Universe&mdash;with possible cameos by some of the main characters. Lucas: \"The Emperor and Darth Vader are heard about&mdash;people talk about them&mdash;but you never see them because it doesnt take place where they actually are. There are stormtroopers and all that, but there are no Jedis.\" However, as the show was being written, some of these characters appeared in the scripts. Former LucasArts developer Cory Barlog revealed he read Underworld scripts at Skywalker Ranch for episodes featuring Palpatine, where \"They made the Emperor a sympathetic figure who was wronged by this [&hellip;] heartless woman. Shes this hardcore gangster, and she just totally destroyed him as a person. I almost cried while reading this. This is the Emperor, the lightning out of the fingers Emperor. Thats something magical\". Writer Ronald D. Moore said that Vader \"was going to show up for a big two-part episode where there was this big uprising happening, and there was a crack-down on things that were happening on Coruscant. Vader shows up and is kind of like, Were gonna stop all this shit right now.\"\nLucas had originally written a scene for Revenge of the Sith involving the Expanded Universe character Quinlan Vos,The Art of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith but the character received only a mention in the final film.III Lucas himself later instructed the writers of the Star Wars: Republic comic book series to not kill off the character. This has led some fans to speculate that Vos may play a role in the series, although Republic writer Randy Stradley later clarified that he wasnt sure if the character would have appeared and had heard that a different character to Vos might have appeared.Randy Stradley In an interview in the November 2005 edition of the UK magazine Total Film magazine, McCallum was asked \"How can Leia claim to remember her mother when Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth in Sith?,\" to which he replied \"I think that could only be answered in the television series.\" After being impressed by her work on The Han Solo Trilogy, Lucasfilm asked A. C. Crispin for her ideas on possible further books. She proposed a book series that would have focused on Leia between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, but \"Lucasfilm didnt approve the idea of a Leia backstory because they want to keep that era of the SW continuity untouched for the television series theyre considering.\" Karen Traviss was to write a novel involving Boba Fett, but the project was reportedly canceled because of possible conflicts with the TV series. John Jackson Miller had been developing a graphic novel for Dark Horse Comics starring Obi-Wan Kenobi in a Western-like story, but had struggled pitching the project to his Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic editor Jeremy Barlow and the two eventually agreed to shelve the project after hearing rumors in April or May 2007 about the show moving forward, not wishing to potentially conflict with any Kenobi-centric ideas Lucas could have been developing for the show. Millers story was eventually released as the novel Kenobi' in 2013.\nMultiple actors from the films had expressed interest in reprising their roles: Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett), Jay Lagaaia (Gregar Typho), Daniel Logan (young Boba Fett), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), and Ian McDiarmid (The Emperor). For a time, Logan underwent physical training with Ray Park (Darth Maul), in anticipation of reprising his role as Boba Fett, while in the other hand, Bulloch also expressed interest in play an alter ego of Boba Fett, as he thought that Logan would play him in the series due his age. The Phantom Menace actors Andrew Secombe, Lewis MacLeod and Christian Simpson had also expressed interest in reprising their roles as Watto, Sebulba and Gavyn Sykes, respectively, for the series.Making Episode III: 31 Jan 2005 - The Force binds the galaxy together On the other hand, however, Billy Dee Williams refused to reprise his role as Lando Calrissian, nor play the characters uncle, although he hinted in 2005 that he could return to play Lando as an older man, as he presumably didnt know in which place of the timeline the series would be set. In 2006, Toby Philpott, who co-puppeted Jabba the Hutt in Return of the Jedi, doubted very much that he could reprise his role, as he supposed that the series would be made in the USA. Conversely, that same year, various actors who appeared in Jedi had expressed interest in reprising their roles for the series: Tim Dry (JQuille), Mercedes Ngoh (Ryst\u00e1ll Sant, in the films 1997 DVD release), Mike Quinn (Nien Nunb, Ten Numb, Wokling, Ree-Yees, Wol Cabasshite and Sy Snootles), and Simon Williamson (Max Rebo and Jubnuk). In January 2010, Paul Blake stated during an interview that he would like very much to reprise his role as Greedo in the series, although he hadn't been contacted so far to do so.\nMembers of the cast outside the films (or those who played minor roles in the films) had also expressed interest in appearing in the series; Star Wars: The Force Unleashed actor Sam Witwer wanted to appear (possibly as Galen Marek, Vaders secret apprentice), and hinted in an interview that he would indeed be involved. Likewise, Adrienne Wilkinson showed interest in seeing her character of Maris Brood in the series. In 2007, Shannon McRandle, who modeled as Mara Jade Skywalker for the Star Wars card games, expressed her desire to audition to play the role of Jade in the series in order to develop her between Episodes III and IV. On March 9, 2009, actress Rose Byrne, who appeared in Attack of the Clones, told MTV that casting for the series was underway, and that some of her friends had auditioned for roles. However, Star Wars Insider 109 claimed that scripts had yet to be written at that point, and would precede any earnest casting efforts, contradicting Byrnes claims.\n\n\u2022 Development\n\nGeorge Lucas\nPrior to the release of the original Star Wars film in 1977, rumors began circulating that a TV series would be produced based on the film.Starlog #7Starlog #18Starlog #90 Although such a project never came to fruition, George Lucas became involved (to varying degrees) in three live-action Star Wars television productions: The Star Wars Holiday Special, Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure, and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. While the Holiday Special was a critical failure, both Ewok films won Emmy awards and had a positive critical reaction. In each case, the networks saw the productions as backdoor pilots for possible television series, though Lucas wasnt interested.Filmfax #69/70, October 1998/January 1999Starlog #89 From 1992 to 1996, Lucas produced the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles', during which he developed a love of making television.\nIn late 2004, rumors again began to circulate of a live-action Star Wars series in development. Lucas officially announced his plans for a live-action Star Wars television series at Celebration III, saying \"We probably wont start that until sometime next year.\" He also spoke of plans for a new animated television series set during the Clone Wars, which he expected to be produced first.Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide Also at the event, Rick McCallum elaborated; \"He [George] envisions somewhere like 100 hours between Episode III and Episode IV.\" However, at 2007s Celebration Europe, McCallum claimed that the plan was to produce \"up to 400 episodes\". He also revealed that \"Ive had three conceptual artists working on it now for about seven months.\" The original plan was for the first season to be entirely written and produced before shopping the series to broadcast networks; After a network was committed, work would commence on the following seasons.\n\n\u2022 Writing\n\nRonald D. Moore\nLucas and McCallum (and, according to writer Matthew Grahman, the shows associate producer Steve Irwin) interviewed over 200 prospective \"writers of real significance\" from all over the world&mdash;including England, the United States, Paris, Prague, Budapest and Australia. McCallum remarked, \"It's about who's talented, who's got the strength to challenge George and also, much more importantly, what's the dynamics of the five or six people. If they can let go of their ego and work toward a specific goal. Sometimes you think 'I'm sick of writing alone.' Everyone has their ebb and flow. We're trying to get everyone in their peak.\" Writers from Battlestar Galactica, Heroes, and Lost, as well as those from the Star Wars books and comics, were considered as part of the final interview process in late 2007. In the end, six writers were hired&mdash;including Terry Cafolla, Chris Chibnall, Louise Fox, Tony McNamara, Fiona Seres, Matthew Graham, Ronald D. Moore, and Stephen Scaia&mdash;and were expected to start work in November 2007. Current Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies was asked to write for the show, but turned it down due to his desire to do his own projects in a different style to both franchises; however, he did claim to be jealous of whoever ended up being hired.\nAfter the writers were hired, story outlines took shape over the next three months. McCallum expected the first writing conference to occur in late 2007, and sessions had began by August 2008. The writers worked closely with the art department (including concept artist Erik Tiemens), which had been working to design sets, environments, vehicles and aliens since 2007.Total Film magazine, May 2008 issue, p. 138 Ronald D. Moore commented on the writing process: \"The scripts were written as if money was no object. George was like, Dont worry about it. [Producer Rick McCallum] would groan and put his head in his hands periodically. So for us it was like, Okay, f\u2013k it, lets write whatever we want.\" &hellip; \"His mandate on the scripts were: Think big. Dont have any worries. Well make it. Budget is no object. So we wrote these gigantic pieces.\" Lucas originally wanted a seasons worth of 25 scripts, but eventually extended this to 50 (i.e. two seasons worth, with 25 episodes per season). Writer Matthew Graham described the writers as two teams that Lucas played off of each other: Those who were big Star Wars fans, and those who werent as familiar with the franchise.\"Going Underground\", SFX 336 Moore later told collider.com: \"And what happened was, you know, we wrote the scripts and then George said OK, this is enough for now, and then Ill get back to you. I want to look into all the production things. And then time went by and like a year or something after that is when he sold Lucasfilm to Disney.\" In the end, fifty hours worth of episodes plus a \"movie-of-the-week\" were written, all in various stages of development. In a January 2012 interview with IGN, McCallum revealed the working title to be Underworld, which had originally served as the working title for an early concept for Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.The Art and Making of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed McCallum denied this the next day, though he later told Entertainment Weekly that it was indeed the working title.\n\n\u2022 Filming\n\nRick McCallum\nMcCallum expected that he and Lucas would approach the series in a similar manner as they had The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. Like on that earlier series, they hoped to give each episode the look of a feature film, with feature-level production values and visual effects on a television budget. Lucas also talked of using the show as a template for how he would approach \"more personal films\" that he hoped to create. In 2005, Lucas stated his intentions to shoot the series using consumer-level cameras, which McCallum said would be high-definition cameras. In late 2009, Lucas and McCallum invited filmmaker Phillip Bloom to Skywalker Ranch to advise on using different types of cameras for pick-up photography on Red Tails, and for the live-action series.Bloom, Phillip Lucas expected that, in producing the show, he would \"do what would typically cost $20 million, for $1 million.\" According to IESB, McCallum has said that each episode will have a budget of 2-4 million dollars.\nPrincipal photography was planned to take place all around the world, with a likely base in Sydney, Australia. In respect to the stunts, prequel trilogy stunt coordinators Nick Gillard and Kyle Rowling expressed interest in 2006 in working on the series as fighting directors. On the other hand, prequel trilogy special effects technician Matt Sloan hinted the possibility to return in order to do the series visual effects. McCallum originally expected production to begin in either 2008 or 2009. He expected the first season to consist of thirteen-to-sixteen episodes, shot over a one-to-two-year time period. In March 2009, preliminary casting was still underway; a Lucasfilm representative claimed at the time that official casting would begin once the scripts were complete and that the series would not go into production until 2010. In a June 2011 interview, McCallum said that the show would most likely be filmed in the Czech Republic, a location used multiple times by LucasFilm for various productions. Reportedly, Jim Marquand, son of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi' director Richard Marquand, was hired as one of the directors. McCallum expected that each episode of the series would have its own original score, and hoped that John Williams would return as composer.\nAt a 2010 screening of The Empire Strikes Back in Chicago, Illinois, Lucas announced that the series was \"on hold\" due to budget concerns.\nLucas and McCallum later elaborated that the scripts were prohibitively expensive for television, and that the show was put on hold in order to wait on technology to develop to the point that costs could be kept relatively low. Lucas had long planned to build an expansion to his Lucas Valley property called Grady Ranch, which would have been \"a digital media production facility for movies and television.\" However, in early 2012, Marin County rejected the project due to concerns over traffic and noise. According to Pablo Hidalgo, this marked the end of the show as a viable project.Pablo Hidalgo In June 2012, McCallum also credited the logistics of the television market as one of the reasons for shelving Underworld.\nOn October 30, 2012, The Walt Disney Company announced an agreement to acquire Lucasfilm, including the rights to the Star Wars franchise. In a conference call following the press release, Disney expressed interest in the potential of a Star Wars television series, but did not go into details. Soon after, it was announced that McCallum had retired from Lucasfilm. In January 2013, ABC president Paul Lee told Entertainment Weekly that the live-action Star Wars series was being reevaluated for production. This was confirmed by Bob Iger that March. That August, Lee again visited the topic of a Star Wars live-action series; \"Weve started conversations. Id love to go there. Im a particular fan of Lucasfilm. Its an amazing world\". Other ABC executives, however, later reiterated this in 2016 and 2017. In December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told Slashfilm that Lucasfilm had been looking at the material for both Underworld and the canceled video game Star Wars: 1313, and that those projects may still be developed. In August 2017, Disney announced that it was removing its Star Wars and Marvel content from Netflix, in favor of its own new streaming service that would also include new content created exclusively for the service. On November 9, 2017, Variety reported that Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger revealed during the companys quarterly earnings call that Disney was planning a live-action Star Wars TV series entitled The Mandalorian, which debuted at the end of 2019 on its streaming service Disney+. This series, together with additional Star Wars series that followed it such as The Book of Boba Fett, was produced with a new technology called Stagecraft (informally known as \"The Volume\"). Variety observed that Stagecraft fulfilled Lucas desire for a cost-effective technology to produce a Star Wars TV show.\n\n\u2022 Release and legacy\n\nDave Filoni to Variety\nIn a 2006 interview, Steve Sansweet said that he expected the series to be released \"toward the end of the decade.\" He gave the time period until release to be \"about 3 years.\" A teaser image for the series was shown at Toy Fair 2007, advertising the next three years of Star Wars: the 30th anniversary of the saga and the release of The Force Unleashed in 2007 (which was ultimately pushed back to 2008), the new Clone Wars TV series in 2008, and the live-action series in 2009. Rick McCallum expected the series to be released simultaneously worldwide and to be broadcast on cable. Both Disney and News Corp were rumored to have shown interest in acquiring broadcast rights for the show, with the former offering ABC and ABC Family and the latter offering FOX and FX. Additionally, Lucas voiced his interest in distributing the series via the Internet&mdash;specifically StarWars.com.\nAt 2005s Celebration III, Lucas told audiences that if the live-action series (along with the new Clone Wars animated series) was successful, more series could follow. At 2007s Celebration Europe, McCallum explained that \"One of the ideas is that well have multiple series going on in about two or three years time.\" McCallum said he hoped that after the series second or third year, a character could have their own spin-off series, and by the fourth or fifth year, the production staff could have at least five separate series running. Lucas described the series as \"one show that will split into four shows, focusing on different characters.\"\nComments from Lucasfilm employees (such as Sue Rostoni and Jim Ward) had hinted that tie-ins such as spin-off books and video games were planned. The canceled video game Star Wars: 1313 was originally conceived as a direct tie-in to Underworld; After Underworld was postponed in 2010 due to budget constraints, 1313 was altered to be its own distinct project. However, at George Lucass request, the final game was to have still taken inspiration from elements of Underworld. The Clone Wars introduced Level 1313, as well as the character Saw Gerrera, who was also conceived for Underworld.New Rogue One Characters Revealed, LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures &#124; The Star Wars Show According to James Luceno, Palpatines first name, \"Sheev\" (which he revealed in his 2014 novel Tarkin), was reportedly created by Lucas for the show.50 min - 52 min mark:\nThe animated series Star Wars Rebels was influenced by ideas developed by Lucas for Underworld. The Church of the Force&mdash;a background element related to Lor San Tekka from Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens&mdash;was created by Lucas for Underworld. John Knoll originally developed the concept for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story in the mid-2000s during the production of the prequel trilogy, in the hopes that it could be an episode of the live-action series.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Panel After the release of the prequels, Zack Snyder was also developing a Star Wars story with Lucasfilm; After the Disney purchase, Snyder developed the project into the film Rebel Moon (2023). The film Solo: A Star Wars Story showed the first meeting between Han Solo and Chewbacca along with Lando Calrissian losing the Millennium Falcon to Solo, two stories which were originally planned for Underworld. Kratoss character arc from the 2018 God of War video game was inspired by the unproduced Underworld scripts. Former LucasArts developer Cory Barlog revealed that he read scripts at Skywalker Ranch that were written by writers of 24 and The Shield. According to Barlog, \"They made the Emperor a sympathetic figure who was wronged by this [...] heartless woman. Shes this hardcore gangster, and she just totally destroyed him as a person. I almost cried while reading this. This is the Emperor, the lightning out of the fingers Emperor. That's something magical.\"\nTest footage of Underworld that Stargate Studios created as a proof of concept in 2010 was discovered on Stargate Studios Vimeo page in January 2020.holonet It depicts a female Rebel agent stealing plans for an Imperial Star Destroyer and setting off an electrical attack on Imperial stormtroopers.\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nHyperspace fan club]] newsletter from George Lucas\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 New Rogue One Characters Revealed, LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures &#124; The Star Wars Show\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Panel\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Underworld",

    "plain_text": "rwm\nD20 system roleplaying game]] from Wizards of the Coast or the Star Wars Roleplaying series from Fantasy Flight Games\nThe Star Wars Roleplaying Game was the first licensed roleplaying game set in the Star Wars universe. It was published by West End Games from 1987The Secrets of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire until they lost the license in 1998. A German-language version was published by Welt der Spiele a few years later.\nOne player is the gamemaster who runs the gameworld, being something like the director and referee, while four to eight other players have a single character or role to play. Several events (like damage from fights) are determined by dice. Gameplays were short one-shot adventures or longer, more elaborate campaigns. The player characters have various skills and equipment and some can even use the Force, albeit with the danger of turning to the Dark Side if a character does not behave properly, at which the player would lose control of the character.\nThe rules of the game were developed by Greg Costikyan. Three versions of the main rulebook were published: first edition, second edition, and \"Revised and Expanded\" second edition. All three were based on West End Games' D6 System.\nThe West End Games sourcebook collection is made of almost 100 books&mdash;not including second editions and compilations&mdash;plus 15 quarterly magazine issues under the title Star Wars Adventure Journal. They also edited several books related to, but not belonging to, the Roleplaying Game line, including Star Warriors, the board games Escape from the Death Star and Assault on Hoth; the two-player game Lightsaber Dueling, the Introductory Adventure Game, Star Wars Miniatures Battles, the Live-Action Adventures and single-player adventure books.\nThe books contained not only game scenarios and guides, but also detailed descriptions (and expansions) of familiar locations, items, species, creatures and characters from the original trilogy, along with new ones. The Clone Wars was one of the themes that were off-limit to the publisher by Lucasfilm. As such, the lore produced for the RPG was one of the major sources of Expanded Universe material before the publication of Heir to the Empire in 1991 sparked new interest in Star Wars publications, and remained an important source as well. Being one of the first sources giving numbers and data to the universe shown in the films, several of the statements given by the sourcebooks have been retconned or corrected to better reflect the films and Expanded Universe fiction. Among the best known corrections are the continuity issues involving the Super Star Destroyers and the \"discovery\" of the Mon Calamari by the Galactic Empire.\nWhen Timothy Zahn was hired to write what became The Thrawn Trilogy, he was sent a box of West End Games Star Wars books and directed to co-ordinate his writing with the background material already developed in the roleplaying game.Timothy Zahn, in the Foreword to The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook After the novel trilogys success, West End Games created a series of sourcebooks inspired by Zahns work.\nIn 1999, West End Games lost the Star Wars RPG license. The new licensee, Wizards of the Coast, began production of a new roleplaying game using their d20 System. As for West End Games, in 2004 they started publishing D6 Space, a generic space opera game system based on the former Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, but not including specific Star Wars content. In 2012 Fantasy Flight Games released their own Star Wars RPG called Edge of the Empire.\nIn the early 1990s, before the promulgation of the modern Internet, the FidoNet Star Wars Echo ran a message forum for playing the West End Games Star Wars Roleplaying Game on-line on BBS.\nIn 2017, Fantasy Flight Games announced a 30th Anniversary Editions reprint of the first editions rule- and sourcebook, scheduled originally for Q4 2017, but was pushed back several times until its July 5, 2018 release.\n\n\u2022 Source books\n\n\u2022 First Edition\n\nclass=\"wikitable sortable headerbackground\"

It was also where the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]], the template for the clone army, lived for a time. Jango's clone \"son\" [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] lived here with him.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:ITW2_Tipoca_City.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tipoca City]]\n[[Kamino/Legends|Kamino's]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]], Tipoca City, consisted of a network of stilt structures that spanned more than a hundred kilometers along Kamino's western equator and was considered by many to be the heart of [[Kaminoan/Legends|Kaminoan]] society. The millions of Kaminoans who occupied Tipoca worked either with the [[Cloning/Legends|cloning]] program or with the bureaucracy. No Kaminoans took residence within the [[City/Legends|city]], nor was there any public space. Nearly all Kaminoans who worked within the city lived in numerous satellite cities situated around the capital. Constant traffic ran to and from Tipoca, as workers, bureaucrats, and many others traveled to and from their homes. The only living space in the city was the quarters of the [[Prime Minister (Kamino)|prime minister]] and the military staff, and a group of apartments for cloning scientists. The scientists resided in Tipoca in alternating shifts of three months each before returning to their homes and families.\n\n[[File:Kamino_landingpad.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A landing pad on Tipoca City bearing [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett's]] [[Slave I/Legends|''Slave I'']].]]\nAside from the governmental and clone manufacturing functions, Tipoca City also served as the seat of both the [[Kamino Space Control/Legends|Kamino Space Traffic Control]] and the [[Kaminoan Planetary Defense/Legends|Kamino Planetary Defense]] Forces. Most of the Space Control's data came from the huge communication towers that dominated much of the city's skyline. Largely due to the cloning facilities importance to Kamino, the Planetary Defense Forces were coordinated from Tipoca. The city relied on passive measures (in form of energy shielding) and more \"pro-active\" [[Turbolaser/Legends|turbolaser]] emplacements. Because the defensive shields provided little protection against troop invasions, the KPD also retained thousands of Kaminoan soldiers in the barracks.\n\nTipoca City's architecture was influenced by two primary architectural styles originating from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] and [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. The concept for the city being built on stilts was derived from the [[Alderaanian Oversea]] style.

It was also where the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the template for the clone army, lived for a time. Jango's clone \"son\" Boba Fett lived here with him.\n\n\u2022 Description\n\nKaminos capital, Tipoca City, consisted of a network of stilt structures that spanned more than a hundred kilometers along Kaminos western equator and was considered by many to be the heart of Kaminoan society. The millions of Kaminoans who occupied Tipoca worked either with the cloning program or with the bureaucracy. No Kaminoans took residence within the city, nor was there any public space. Nearly all Kaminoans who worked within the city lived in numerous satellite cities situated around the capital. Constant traffic ran to and from Tipoca, as workers, bureaucrats, and many others traveled to and from their homes. The only living space in the city was the quarters of the prime minister and the military staff, and a group of apartments for cloning scientists. The scientists resided in Tipoca in alternating shifts of three months each before returning to their homes and families.\nSlave I'.]]\nAside from the governmental and clone manufacturing functions, Tipoca City also served as the seat of both the Kamino Space Traffic Control and the Kamino Planetary Defense Forces. Most of the Space Controls data came from the huge communication towers that dominated much of the citys skyline. Largely due to the cloning facilities importance to Kamino, the Planetary Defense Forces were coordinated from Tipoca. The city relied on passive measures (in form of energy shielding) and more \"pro-active\" turbolaser emplacements. Because the defensive shields provided little protection against troop invasions, the KPD also retained thousands of Kaminoan soldiers in the barracks.\nTipoca Citys architecture was influenced by two primary architectural styles originating from Alderaan and Kashyyyk. The concept for the city being built on stilts was derived from the Alderaanian Oversea style. Middle-period Krorral, previously used by the Wookiee Gkrur clan on Kashyyyk and colonies of the moons of Alaris was adopted in the form of the sweeping and centralized dome structures. An additional appeal of the Krorral element was that the rain-sloughing nature of the architecture bore numerous similarities to the first Kaminoan land colonies.Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds' Most all of these buildings where accented by high power lightning rods, dotting most platforms, even minor ones. If a rod was damaged, however, and lightning struck the rod, a fundamental design flaw would prompt the lightning rod, and usually the whole platform it stood on, to explode.\nPlaces in Tipoca City included Cargo Platform C-22, Security Sector Six, the Central Armory, and Level Nine.\nThe clone military education complex was where the Galactic Republic's Grand Army was trained.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n.]]\nThe city was established after Kaminos climate changed and the entire planet flooded.

During [[Operation: Knightfall/Legends|Operation: Knightfall]], [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] marched into the Archives, flanked by the [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] of the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] and demanded that Chief Librarian [[Jocasta Nu/Legends|Jocasta Nu]] open the vaults and give him access to the [[Jedi beacon/Legends|Jedi beacon]]. Refusing to do so, Vader impaled Madame Nu, killing her. Shocked, the Jedi studying amongst the stacks ignited their lightsabers and attacked Vader and his troops. As Vader slew droves of Jedi, he ordered his troopers to secure the Archives and all its information. Outraged, the surviving Jedi turned their weapons and [[Force power/Legends|Force abilities]] on the Stacks themselves, destroying countless centuries of information. However, the Sith had the upperhand, managing to slay all the Jedi<ref name=\"EPIIIVG\" /> as well as [[Temple employee]]s<ref name=\"CNII\" /> and save several shelves of data.<ref name=\"EPIIIVG\" />\n\nShortly after the rise of the Empire, [[Gregar Typho/Legends|Gregar Typho]] of the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]] infiltrated the Jedi library in search of a lead on the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Senator/Legends|Galactic Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]. While cautiously navigating the debris-strewn floor, Typho detected bounty hunter [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] slinking through the Stacks. Startled by the sound of movement, Sing [[Skirmish in the Jedi Temple|attacked]] Typho; he was able to evade her, fleeing deeper into the library. Grabbing a datastick from a shelf, he shattered it on the floor, causing a small explosion. Distracted, Typho was able to render Sing unconscious using skills taught to him by Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] over a decade previous. Having the upper hand, Typho fled the Temple, having no more information than when he entered.<ref name=\"CNII\" />\n\nOnce the Temple was secured in the aftermath of Operation: Knightfall, Vader turned the data over to Darth Sidious, who entrusted [[Armand Isard/Legends|Armand Isard]] to recover any valuable data from the shattered font of information and history.<ref name=\"Rise of DV\">''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]''</ref> Sidious himself was known to wander the stacks reviewing knowledge long left inaccessible to him and his predecessors.

However the Empire's security was put to the test when Darth Vader sent his secret [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] [[Galen Marek|Starkiller]] to the abandoned complex to complete the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]]. After getting past the heavy doors installed by the Empire, Starkiller entered a damaged hall of the Archives, slaying all the troopers stationed within. Because of the extensive damage in this wing, the assassin was forced to go through the databank room that contained the large supercomputers capable of storing the information for the holobooks. After reentering the Archives proper, Starkiller was forced to duel the Trials' program, which had taken on the guise of [[Darth Phobos]]. After she was defeated, Starkiller left the damaged hall and the Temple. When security crews returned, they quickly locked the Archives down, sealing it off to everyone but Sidious. The Jedi Archives were then vigilantly guarded by [[Imperial Senate Sentinel]]s and [[Clone shadow trooper/Legends|shadow troopers]], in constant wait for returning Jedi.<ref name=\"TFU\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Tionne_jedi_archives.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jedi [[Tionne Solusar]] working in the Archives]]\nThe Temple would then after lay in cold silence, standing as a testament to Sidious's power and cunning. A bleak monolith, the Temple survived the fall of the Empire, and the taking of the capital by [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] forces. As the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] drew to a close, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], founder of the [[New Jedi Order]], ventured inside the ziggurat and wandered the long, empty halls. Returning with [[Jedi historian]] [[Tionne Solusar]], the two Jedi began the long task of restoring the Archives, updating the catalogs and erasing the lies created by Sidious.<ref name=\"BRS\">''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron]]''</ref> Several years later, as Coruscant [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|fell]] to the [[Yuuzhan Vong]], the library was damaged beyond restoration. However, in preparation for disaster, Solusar had scanned the databanks, saving all the data to be kept safe in the [[Space station/Legends|space station]] called [[Shelter]].<ref name=\"NJO Rebel Stand\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]''</ref>\n\n==Reconstruction==\nWhen the grounds of the Old Temple were recovered during the clean-up following the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], the [[Reconstruction Authority]] under the instruction of [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Cal Omas]] began rebuilding the Temple. Following blueprints from the past structure found by Solusar in the Archives, the [[new Jedi Temple]] was erected, and the Archives and library were fully restored to their former grandeur by [[35 ABY/Legends|35 ABY]],<ref name=\"DNI\" /> with the Temple library completely operational by the time of the [[Dark Nest Crisis]].<ref name=\"LOTF Exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the time leading up to the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] wandered into the depths of the stacks as a starting point when he [[Flow-walking|flow-walked]] back to the time of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]]. Wandering through the past, he watched as his grandfather, Darth Vader, slew countless Jedi.<ref name=\"LOTFBL\" /> During the war, the [[Galactic Alliance Guard]] was ordered to [[Invasion of the New Jedi Temple|capture]] the Temple as the Jedi had betrayed the Alliance at the bloody [[Battle of Kuat (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Kuat]]. Prepared for such an attack, the Jedi had begun evacuating the Temple. Apprentice [[Seha Dorvald]] acted quickly and scanned the Archives before fleeing the capital to meet up with her fellow Jedi.<ref name=\"LOTFF\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''</ref>\n\nAfter reoccupying the Temple soon after the war's end, [[Jedi healer/Legends|Jedi healer]] [[Cilghal]] accessed the stacks in order to obtain a lead on the [[Force psychosis|condition]] plaguing [[Valin Horn]]. Searching for any mention of an illness with an unusual result on an ''electroencephaloscan'' she came across an audio recording compiled by a [[Unidentified Jedi Knight (documentarian)|Jedi]] of the Old Republic doing research on the different [[Species/Legends|species]] with members in the Jedi Order. The recording was of [[Kel Dor/Legends|Kel Dor]] Master [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]], who knew of a technique to negate the scan's results. Reporting this to Master Skywalker, they concluded that it was a technique developed by the [[Baran Do]] Sages of [[Dorin/Legends|Dorin]].<ref name=\"FOTJO\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref>\n\nLater during the [[43 ABY|same year]] as more Jedi fell to the disease, Master Cilghal was forced to defend herself from fellow Jedi [[Jysella Horn]], who attacked the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] Jedi as they were researching the affliction seen in [[Seff Hellin]] and Valin Horn in the First Hall. Alerting [[Temple Security Force]]s that Jysella Horn was suffering from the disease and on the loose the Mon Cal called on other Jedi in the Archives to help, including [[Radd Minker]] and [[Natua Wan]]. Leaping over the rails of the walkways, Jysella ran to the main entrance of the Archives and sealed the door. Minker and Cilghal were forced to slowly slice through with their lightsabers, though by the time they were finished, Jysella had made it to the [[Processional Way/Legends|Processional Way]].<ref name=\"FOTJOM\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]''</ref>\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Dk_archive.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A map of the Archives, detailing the four main halls, the large transit area beneath and a floor-by-floor view of the areas below]]\nErected near the roof of the Temple Ziggurat, the Jedi Archives was a circular, two-story chamber consisting of holobook shelves known as the Stacks and data rooms filled with computers.<ref name=\"TJP\">[[The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force (real-life book)|''The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force'']]</ref> An outer hall encircled the chamber, lined with a collection of [[Data rod/Legends|datasticks]] and various other storage devices. The chamber itself was arranged into eight halls and four long, primary halls that converged in a large rotunda in the center like the spokes of a wheel.<ref name=\"CNII\" /> Four additional wings were set between the primary halls,<ref name=\"CNII\" /> each of which had a central aisle that ran its length, with several tables topped with computer terminals that were linked to the main index catalog. The second and fourth halls branched off into two smaller aisles as they led to the Holocron Vaults on the outer wall.<ref name=\"TJP\" /> Off of these main aisles were hundreds of smaller ones that divided the stacks. Each of the Stacks contained trillions of datatapes and datacards, carefully sorted and arranged into categories and subcategories.<ref name=\"DBPOD\" /> At the end of the third hall, [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolifts]] on this level led to the [[Analysis Rooms/Legends|Analysis Rooms]] and the library several floors below.<ref name=\"SWCL\" /> The great windows overlooking the two stories of the Archives were filled with statues of Jedi brandishing their lightsabers, as if defending the great storehouse.<ref name=\"TCWHH\" />\n\nAmongst the four main aisles were [[Bronzium/Legends|bronzium]] sculptures of some of the most famous [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] known to the Order, displayed at intervals along the stacks on stone pedestals. Among these busts were depictions of the [[Lost Twenty/Legends|Lost Twenty]], the only Masters that had willingly left the Order. On each pedestal rested a plaque describing the great acts of the displayed master, although, those for The Lost did not list a reason for leaving.<ref name=\"DBPOD\" /> Likenesses of Masters [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]], [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], [[Saesee Tiin/Legends|Saesee Tiin]], [[Chon Actrion/Legends|Chon Actrion]] and [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] were only a few of the many depicted.<ref name=\"AOTC\" />\n\n===The Rotunda===\n[[File:Archivescomputerbank.png|thumb|right|250px|The central chamber of the library]]\nAt the center of the Archives was the great rotunda, the access point from which any Jedi could explore the vast chamber. Foot traffic in the rotunda typically entered via the First Hall, generally accepted as the main entrance to the Archives. A massive, circular chamber, the rotunda's arching doorways stretched to the ceiling, granting anyone in the area a view of the entire Archives room. Terminals in the rotunda allowed Jedi to access any of the four halls, narrowing their searches to a specific area.<ref name=\"DBPOD\" /> Carpeted in red, the chamber's centerpiece was a large database station used by the [[Jedi archivist/Legends|Chief Librarian]] to keep record of the books stored in the Stacks.<ref name=\"TCWHH\" />\n\n===The First Hall===\nKnown as the main entrance to the Archives due to the great, hand-carved wooden doors at its front, the First Hall contained great records on philosophy and manuscripts detailing the history of the Republic.<ref name=\"DBPOD\" /> Personal journals of over a billion Jedi were also held here. While on missions, Jedi such as [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]]<ref name=\"Shatterpoint novel\">[[Shatterpoint (novel)|''Shatterpoint'']]</ref> and [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]] would sometimes record their thoughts and would turn them over to the Archives for review by future Jedi. Many of the more in-depth works on [[Force power/Legends|Force abilities]] were restricted to Jedi Masters; Padawans required permission from the Chief Librarian to delve into the more controversial works.<ref name=\"Legacy of the Jedi\">''[[Legacy of the Jedi]]''</ref>\n\n===The Second Hall===\nRunning perpendicular to the first and third halls, the Second Hall contained data dedicated to mathematical and engineering sciences. Works related to the topics on [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] and how to achieve it and construct engines and vehicles capable of such feats were among the blue-glowing Stacks. Floor-plans of the galaxy's government buildings and other points of interest were found here, along with many manufacturers' weapon designs.<ref name=\"DBPOD\" /> The computer systems here had readouts on all Temple activities including a databank dedicated to the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council's]] current seating arrangements.<ref name=\"SWCL\" /> Splitting into two aisles, the hall had access ways into the two Holocron Vaults on that end of the chamber.<ref name=\"TJP\" />\n\n===The Third Hall===\n[[File:Library_Busts_AotC.png|thumb|left|250px|Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers a fault in the Archive's records.]]\nThe Third Hall was directly opposite the first and was filled with information on the geography and culture of every known planet in the Galactic Republic. It included starmaps of interstellar and planetary regions, and detailed analyses on specific civilizations.<ref name=\"DBPOD\" /> The ExplorCorps often contributed to this section, adding new planetary details as worlds were discovered beyond the Republic's reach.<ref name=\"TCWCG\" />\n\nJust before the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], somewhere between [[32 BBY/Legends|32]] and [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], information within the Third Hall's scope of knowledge concerning the planet [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]], the [[Kaminoan/Legends|Kaminoans]], and their [[Cloning/Legends|cloning]] industry was erased. Former Jedi Master [[Dooku/Legends|Count Dooku]] secretly committed this act in order to conceal the creation of the [[Grand Army of the Republic|Clone Army]] from the Jedi Council. This was uncovered by Jedi Knight [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] when he tried to identify the origin of Galactic [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Amidala's]] [[Zam Wesell/Legends|would-be assassin]], who used a Kaminoan saber dart. This discovery eventually led to the uncovering of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]' plans for war, putting into motion the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"AOTC\" />\n\n===The Fourth Hall===\n{{Quote|Master Kenobi says that there are even texts here that are forbidden to be read.\"<br />\"The Archives hold a great many secrets, it is true.|Ahsoka Tano talking to Madame Jocasta Nu|<ref name=\"TCWHH\" />}}\n[[File:ParasittiAsJocasta-HH.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Cato Parasitti, disguised as Madame Jocasta Nu, infiltrates Temple security from a terminal in the Archives]]\n\nThe Fourth Hall, running on the same plane as the second, was also split into two smaller wings; each dedicated to zoological research relating information on every known species of flora and fauna in the galaxy. It was within these stacks in the year [[990 BBY]], that [[Darth Zannah/Legends|Darth Zannah]], disguised as Jedi apprentice [[Nalia Adollu]], researched the crustaceous [[orbalisk]]s, a task she had undertaken in order to save her master, [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane's]], life. With a reference disk provided by then-Chief Archivist [[Barra-Rona-Ban]] she was able to uncover the secret to their removal in a text written by Dr. [[Osaf Hamud]]. The visiting [[Darovit]], Zannah's cousin, discovered her, and because she had found what she was looking for, she kidnapped him and fled. In her rush, she had forgotten the datadisk with all of her information, and the Jedi, led by [[Valenthyne Farfalla]], were able to [[Duel on Tython|track her]] back to her master on [[Tython/Legends|Tython]].<ref name=\"DBPOD\" />\n\nIn [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]] concocted a scheme to raise an army of [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]]. As the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] drew so many Jedi from the Temple, it would be easier to [[Raid on the Jedi Temple/Legends|infiltrate]] one of the Holocron Vaults in the Temple. Selecting the [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane/Legends|Cad Bane]], Sidious supplied Bane with schematics of the Temple and a large supply of [[Galactic Credit Standard/Legends|credits]] and ordered him to retrieve the [[Acquisition Division/Legends|Acquisition Division's]] [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]]. In order to complete the mission, Bane killed Master [[Bolla Ropal/Legends|Bolla Ropal]] in order to secure the [[Kyber memory crystal/Legends|Kyber memory crystal]], the activating device for the holocron. Then, after aquuiring the body of Master [[Ord Enisence/Legends|Ord Enisence]], Bane hired fellow bounty hunter [[Cato Parasitti/Legends|Cato Parasitti]] to provide tactical support as he prepared to enter the Jedi stronghold. The two bounty hunters, accompanied by the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Todo 360/Legends|Todo 360]], set off to the Temple, Parasitti disguised as Enisence via her [[Clawdite/Legends|Clawdite]] shape-shifting talents.<ref name=\"TCWHH\" />\n\n[[File:SinubeNuTano-LL.png|thumb|left|250px|Madame Jocasta Nu introduces Ahsoka Tano to Jedi Master Tera Sinube in the Archives.]]\n\nOnce inside, Parasitti, still disguised as the [[Skrilling/Legends|Skrilling]] Jedi, made it past the Archives' guard and set up at a console by one of the vaults. Communicating via [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] with Bane, she directed him through the ventilation shafts on the roof of the Temple Ziggurat using the schematics provided by Sidious. With all her focus on the data terminal, Parasitti failed to see the approaching Madame Jocasta Nu. Having noticed Parasitti's short temper when talking to Guard [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]] earlier, Nu had hoped to comfort the odd-acting Enisence. Startled, Parasitti struck Nu, knocking her unconscious. Mimicking Nu's form, Parasitti resumed her efforts in directing Bane. As the Duros successfully captured the holocron, the Temple went on high alert. After a short duel, Ahsoka Tano apprehended Parasitti, though Bane escaped with the holocron without a fight.<ref name=\"TCWHH\" />\n\nLater that year, Padawan Tano sought guidance in the Archives after petty thief [[Bannamu/Legends|Bannamu]] absconded with her [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] while she and her master were on assignment in the [[Coruscant Underworld/Legends|Coruscant underworld]]. Searching for a lead, she was directed by Madame Nu to the ancient Master [[Tera Sinube/Legends|Tera Sinube]], who was napping in the chamber. Sinube had compiled a massive database of the crime on Coruscant, adding to the wealth of knowledge already stored in the Archives' Stacks. After identifying the [[Patrolian/Legends|Patrolian]] that had stolen the lightsaber, the two Jedi went off to find it.<ref name=\"TCWLL\">{{TCW|Lightsaber Lost}}</ref>\n\n===The Chief Librarian's quarters===\nThe Chief [[Jedi librarian/Legends|Librarian]] who oversaw the Archives night and day had their own private office off of the main halls of the great collection of knowledge. During Master [[Barra-Rona-Ban]]'s [[990 BBY|time]] as Chief Librarian, he had a small desk covered in neat piles of notes and datacard. Along one of the walls was a viewscreen and terminal with hook-ups to the main index catalog: allowing Master Ban to reference any material at will.<ref name=\"DBPOD\" />\n\nThe Chief Archivist, while answering directly to the Council of First Knowledge, was also responsible for briefing Jedi who were preparing for missions; gathering data beforehand and presenting it in a quick session. From their quarters they could quickly created a portfolio and transmit it to the Jedi High Council for review and to help them reach a more informed decision.<ref name=\"Jedi Apprentice: The Only Witness\">''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Only Witness]]''</ref>\n\n===Study halls===\nStudy areas separated the Archives' halls, and consisted of several desks and computers.<ref name=\"CNII\">''[[Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows]]''</ref> The Archives were equipped with private rooms used for diligent researches that went days without sleep. The Chief Archivist would also present information here for Jedi preparing for missions. Service hallways ran adjacent to all of the halls, allowing members of the Temple Security Force to patrol without being seen. During the raid on the Jedi Temple by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], the Sith Lord entered through a study hall to break into a Security station. After slaughtering the [[Jedi brute|guards]] stationed there, Vader disabled a [[Ray shield/Legends|ray shield]] that inhibited his path on the way to the [[Hangar/Legends|hangars]].<ref name=\"EPIIIVG\" />\n\n==Staff==\n[[File:JocastaNu-Db.png|thumb|right|150px|Chief Librarian [[Jocasta Nu/Legends|Jocasta Nu]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].]]\n\nOverseen by the [[Council of First Knowledge/Legends|Council of First Knowledge]], the Archives was directly run by the Chief Librarian. While not necessarily a Council member themselves, the Chief Librarian organized a staff of [[Lore Keeper]]s to maintain the Stacks and update them with new information. Additionally, the Archives employed several [[JN-66 analysis droid/Legends|JN-66]] and [[SP-4 analysis droid/Legends|SP-4]] analysis droids. These droids wandered the Stacks in the main hall assisting those Jedi in need of direction.<ref name=\"TCWCG\" />\n\nThe last in a long line of Chief Librarians, Madame Jocasta Nu, a former [[Jedi High Council/Legends|High Council]] member ran the Archives until the night of [[Operation: Knightfall/Legends|Operation: Knightfall]]. Sensing the fate that would soon befall her collections, she dutifully summoned her last Padawan, [[Jin-Lo Rayce]] to take secret information from the Archives offworld. Taking the tunnels out of the Temple, Rayce managed to survive, founding the [[Agents of Ossus]] as a way of protecting the information until the Order could be rebuilt.<ref name=\"The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide\">''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Trinity-college-library-dub.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Long Room in Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland]]\nThe Jedi Archives in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] is an almost exact digital reconstruction of the Long Room of [[Wikipedia:Library of Trinity College Dublin|Library]] of [[Wikipedia:Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] in [[Wikipedia:Dublin|Dublin]], [[Wikipedia:Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Its imitation extends to the busts of the Lost Twenty, which, in Trinity Library, are busts of alumni, including writer [[Wikipedia:Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift]].<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://www.archeire.com/onsite/jedi_archives|text=Jedi Archives Clones Long Room, Trinity Attacks|archivedate=20040530002316}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Pablo Helman]] on the ''Attack of the Clones'' DVD commentary, during the scene where [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] speaks to [[Jocasta Nu/Legends|Jocasta Nu]], the room include busts of himself, [[George Lucas]], [[Rob Coleman]], and [[John Knoll]].\n\nThe novel ''[[The Clone Wars: Wild Space]]'' erroneously states that the Jedi Archives are located within a third of Tranquillity Spire.\n\nThe touch-screen keyboards of the library's computers in \"[[Holocron Heist]]\" use the [[Aurebesh/Legends|Aurebesh]] symbols in alphabetical order, but display all symbols upside down. Whether this was done intentionally or if it was a mistake by the animators is not known.\n\n[[File:Concept11.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Concept art of the Jedi Temple Library for ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars''.]]\nThe second book of the [[Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi|Fate of the Jedi]] series, ''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]'', has a discrepancy in the layout of the Archives. The first chapter states that Jedi Jysella Horn ascends a [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolift]] from the Jedi Temple Main Entrance hall to reach the First Hall of the Archives, located on the uppermost levels of the Temple. However, in the second chapter of the same book, Jedi Horn is now on the fourth floor of the previously two-story Archives chamber. After descending over the walkways of the other floors, she lands on the first level and runs out of the Archives into the main hall from which she can see the [[Processional Way/Legends|Processional Way]]. This discrepancy is never explained.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of the Jedi Archives}}\n*''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]'' {{Ab|The Old Republic: Revan

    "plain_text": "Jedi Archive: Rarely Seen Images from the Lucasfilm Archives\nJedi Order]]\n\u2022 New Jedi Order\n\nHolocron Heist\nThe Jedi Archives, also known as the Jedi Temple Library, Slide 11 was a fathomless collection of ancient knowledge and research dating back thousands of years, as well as an innumerable amount of reading material collected from all corners of the galaxy. Directly operated by the Librarians Assembly and overseen by the Council of First Knowledge, the Archives served as a repository for journals and artifacts.The Clone Wars Campaign Guide The Archives were located in the First Knowledge Quarter of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and were, for the most part, open at all hours of the day and accessible to any Jedi in need of information. While Jedi were welcome to scan or copy most any data in the Stacks, removal of any material from the Archives was strictly prohibited.Darth Bane: Rule of Two Remote access to the databases was near impossible, with eradicators built into the Temples outer walls and firewalls in the database mainframes. Containing holobooks, datasticks, and a variety of other modern and ancient storage devices, the library sported information that was restricted to only members of the Jedi High Council.\n\n\u2022 History\n\nJocasta Nu\nAfter the world of Ossus was devastated in 3996 BBY and the Great Jedi Library was destroyed, the Jedi fled their long time home, taking with them what they could of Jedi Master Odan-Urrs great collection.The New Essential Chronology Fleeing across the galaxy, the Jedi met at Exis Station, gathering to them what they could from Ossus.Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Redemption 1 Following the conclave, the Jedi largely relocated to Coruscant, in the Jedi Temple constructed by four Jedi Masters.Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force The ever-growing Temples original incarnation of the library was located several stories above the main entrance of the Temple, serving as Archives and library for several centuries. However, the chambers were small and cramped, and they were eventually moved into more spacious chambers as the Temple underwent another expansion around 2500 BBY.\nupdates the Archives records.]]\nFollowing the Jedi Civil War, the Temple would lie empty, as Darth Sion began the Jedi Purge of 3954 BBY, leaving but a handful of Jedi in the galaxy.Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide 3951 BBY saw the end of the Purge and the beginning of a time of peace in the galaxy. The Jedi reinhabited Coruscant thanks to the efforts of an exile that defeated the ruthless Darth Nihilus.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Expanding their collection of information, the Order flourished for several centuries. However the peace was transitory as the Sith Empire reappeared in 3653 BBY, appearing from the Unknown Regions and swooping in to take Coruscant from the Jedi. Raiding the Temple, the Sith marched in and killed several key Jedi. The Temple and Archives in ruin, it would be several years before the Galactic Senate could raise enough money to restore the edifice. As the Jedi had relocated to their homeworld of Tython, the surviving members of the Jedi High Council instructed archivist Gnost-Dural to begin reconstructing the knowledge lost on Coruscant, and recounting the recent history leading up to the Order's loss of control.\nWhile the small chambers originally used to hold the Archives was reconstructed with the Temple, it wasn't until the expansion around 2500 BBY that the Jedi Archives of the modern era were constructed. Featuring long halls of holobooks and displays of ancient tablets, the new Archives chamber would remain the same until the Great Jedi Purge of 19 BBY. The old Archives room was turned into a museum of Temple history, detailing the ever-changing layout of the complex.\ngets direction from Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu.]]\nThe Golden Age of the Old Republic well underway with the passage of the Ruusan Reformation and the supposed extinction of the Sith Order, the Jedi Temple was completed with the re-construction of the Council spires and Tranquility Spire. The Council of First Knowledge focused on expanding their knowledge and erasing all remnants of the Sith from the galaxy. Founding the Exploration Corps from the remnants of the Academy of Jedi Archaeology,Power of the Jedi Sourcebook the Council sent Knights and Masters out into the galaxy to recover dangerous artifacts, as well as to scout unknown worlds to add to the Archives vast wealth of information.Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil'\nAfter over a millennia of peace in the galaxy, the Archives was tampered with following the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. Jedi Master Dooku, having grown disenchanted with the Orders reliance on the corrupt Republic aligned with the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious and deleted several records from the Archives that would prevent Jedi interference in his new masters plans. He also stole secret hyperspace routes for his own purposes for the upcoming war.Labyrinth of Evil\nDuring one of the monthly organization days of 27 BBY, Chief Librarian Jocasta Nus sorting was interrupted by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi who was inquiring after a report he had requested regarding Granta Omega. Nu, irritated due to the interruption, agreed to do a fresh search if Kenobi would come back later in the day. After restoring the Library to its pristine form, Nu summoned Kenobi and connected the dots that he had missed; Omega planned to bring the bacta market to a standstill.Jedi Quest: The Master of Disguise'\nAfter Kenobi discovered the deletion of Kamino from the databanks in 22 BBY, Grand Master Yoda investigated the disappearance, finding that at least 37 additional systems had been erased,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections including Dagobah The Essential Atlas, p. 54 and Dromund star systems.\nThroughout the Clone Wars, the Archives was under tightened security, with Temple Security Forces on constant patrol to ensure the safety of the data stored there. During the war, Dark Jedi Trenox attacked the Temple attempting to steal a holocron from the shelves. While Knight Anakin Skywalker was able to kill Trenox, the Jedi believed that at least one holocron was taken from the Stacks.Star Wars: The New Droid Army\nstorm the archives.]]\nIn 19 BBY, the conclusion of the Clone Wars saw the invasion and destruction of the Temple. During Operation: Knightfall, Sith Lord Darth Vader marched into the Archives, flanked by the clone troopers of the 501st Legion and demanded that Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu open the vaults and give him access to the Jedi beacon. Refusing to do so, Vader impaled Madame Nu, killing her. Shocked, the Jedi studying amongst the stacks ignited their lightsabers and attacked Vader and his troops. As Vader slew droves of Jedi, he ordered his troopers to secure the Archives and all its information. Outraged, the surviving Jedi turned their weapons and Force abilities on the Stacks themselves, destroying countless centuries of information. However, the Sith had the upperhand, managing to slay all the Jedi as well as Temple employees and save several shelves of data.\nShortly after the rise of the Empire, Gregar Typho of the Royal Naboo Security Forces infiltrated the Jedi library in search of a lead on the death of Galactic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. While cautiously navigating the debris-strewn floor, Typho detected bounty hunter Aurra Sing slinking through the Stacks. Startled by the sound of movement, Sing attacked Typho; he was able to evade her, fleeing deeper into the library. Grabbing a datastick from a shelf, he shattered it on the floor, causing a small explosion. Distracted, Typho was able to render Sing unconscious using skills taught to him by Master Qui-Gon Jinn over a decade previous. Having the upper hand, Typho fled the Temple, having no more information than when he entered.\nOnce the Temple was secured in the aftermath of Operation: Knightfall, Vader turned the data over to Darth Sidious, who entrusted Armand Isard to recover any valuable data from the shattered font of information and history.Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader Sidious himself was known to wander the stacks reviewing knowledge long left inaccessible to him and his predecessors. It was during this time the Great Holocron disappeared, falling out of all memory until it resurfaced over fifty years later. Sidious would later be accused of changing great amounts of the data in the Archives to support anti-Jedi propaganda. Opened for tours, the Archives was one of the few chambers that the wealthiest of the wealthy could buy their way into.\nWhile the Archives had always had very heavy security to prevent hacking from outsiders, the agents of the Galactic Empire failed to maintain the anti-tampering measures. Determined Jedi, such as Ekria hacked the databases from elsewhere on Coruscant and deleted all record of herself, and her fellows, Zonder and Drake Logaan.Evasive Action: Recruitment Sealed behind great black doors, the Archives was now impenetrable from all but the Empire. However the Empires security was put to the test when Darth Vader sent his secret apprentice Starkiller to the abandoned complex to complete the Jedi Trials. After getting past the heavy doors installed by the Empire, Starkiller entered a damaged hall of the Archives, slaying all the troopers stationed within. Because of the extensive damage in this wing, the assassin was forced to go through the databank room that contained the large supercomputers capable of storing the information for the holobooks. After reentering the Archives proper, Starkiller was forced to duel the Trials program, which had taken on the guise of Darth Phobos. After she was defeated, Starkiller left the damaged hall and the Temple. When security crews returned, they quickly locked the Archives down, sealing it off to everyone but Sidious. The Jedi Archives were then vigilantly guarded by Imperial Senate Sentinels and shadow troopers, in constant wait for returning Jedi.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\nworking in the Archives]]\nThe Temple would then after lay in cold silence, standing as a testament to Sidiouss power and cunning. A bleak monolith, the Temple survived the fall of the Empire, and the taking of the capital by New Republic forces. As the Galactic Civil War drew to a close, Luke Skywalker, founder of the New Jedi Order, ventured inside the ziggurat and wandered the long, empty halls. Returning with Jedi historian Tionne Solusar, the two Jedi began the long task of restoring the Archives, updating the catalogs and erasing the lies created by Sidious.Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron Several years later, as Coruscant fell to the Yuuzhan Vong, the library was damaged beyond restoration. However, in preparation for disaster, Solusar had scanned the databanks, saving all the data to be kept safe in the space station called Shelter.The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand'\n\n\u2022 Reconstruction\n\nWhen the grounds of the Old Temple were recovered during the clean-up following the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Reconstruction Authority under the instruction of Galactic Alliance Chief of State Cal Omas began rebuilding the Temple. Following blueprints from the past structure found by Solusar in the Archives, the new Jedi Temple was erected, and the Archives and library were fully restored to their former grandeur by 35 ABY, with the Temple library completely operational by the time of the Dark Nest Crisis.Legacy of the Force: Exile\nDuring the time leading up to the Second Galactic Civil War, Jacen Solo wandered into the depths of the stacks as a starting point when he flow-walked back to the time of the Great Jedi Purge. Wandering through the past, he watched as his grandfather, Darth Vader, slew countless Jedi. During the war, the Galactic Alliance Guard was ordered to capture the Temple as the Jedi had betrayed the Alliance at the bloody Battle of Kuat. Prepared for such an attack, the Jedi had begun evacuating the Temple. Apprentice Seha Dorvald acted quickly and scanned the Archives before fleeing the capital to meet up with her fellow Jedi.Legacy of the Force: Fury\nAfter reoccupying the Temple soon after the wars end, Jedi healer Cilghal accessed the stacks in order to obtain a lead on the condition plaguing Valin Horn. Searching for any mention of an illness with an unusual result on an electroencephaloscan she came across an audio recording compiled by a Jedi of the Old Republic doing research on the different species with members in the Jedi Order. The recording was of Kel Dor Master Plo Koon, who knew of a technique to negate the scans results. Reporting this to Master Skywalker, they concluded that it was a technique developed by the Baran Do Sages of Dorin.Fate of the Jedi: Outcast\nLater during the same year as more Jedi fell to the disease, Master Cilghal was forced to defend herself from fellow Jedi Jysella Horn, who attacked the Mon Calamari Jedi as they were researching the affliction seen in Seff Hellin and Valin Horn in the First Hall. Alerting Temple Security Forces that Jysella Horn was suffering from the disease and on the loose the Mon Cal called on other Jedi in the Archives to help, including Radd Minker and Natua Wan. Leaping over the rails of the walkways, Jysella ran to the main entrance of the Archives and sealed the door. Minker and Cilghal were forced to slowly slice through with their lightsabers, though by the time they were finished, Jysella had made it to the Processional Way.Fate of the Jedi: Omen\n\n\u2022 Layout\n\nErected near the roof of the Temple Ziggurat, the Jedi Archives was a circular, two-story chamber consisting of holobook shelves known as the Stacks and data rooms filled with computers.The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force An outer hall encircled the chamber, lined with a collection of datasticks and various other storage devices. The chamber itself was arranged into eight halls and four long, primary halls that converged in a large rotunda in the center like the spokes of a wheel. Four additional wings were set between the primary halls, each of which had a central aisle that ran its length, with several tables topped with computer terminals that were linked to the main index catalog. The second and fourth halls branched off into two smaller aisles as they led to the Holocron Vaults on the outer wall. Off of these main aisles were hundreds of smaller ones that divided the stacks. Each of the Stacks contained trillions of datatapes and datacards, carefully sorted and arranged into categories and subcategories. At the end of the third hall, turbolifts on this level led to the Analysis Rooms and the library several floors below. The great windows overlooking the two stories of the Archives were filled with statues of Jedi brandishing their lightsabers, as if defending the great storehouse.\nAmongst the four main aisles were bronzium sculptures of some of the most famous Jedi Masters known to the Order, displayed at intervals along the stacks on stone pedestals. Among these busts were depictions of the Lost Twenty, the only Masters that had willingly left the Order. On each pedestal rested a plaque describing the great acts of the displayed master, although, those for The Lost did not list a reason for leaving. Likenesses of Masters Yoda, Qui-Gon Jinn, Saesee Tiin, Chon Actrion and Dooku were only a few of the many depicted.\n\n\u2022 The Rotunda\n\nAt the center of the Archives was the great rotunda, the access point from which any Jedi could explore the vast chamber. Foot traffic in the rotunda typically entered via the First Hall, generally accepted as the main entrance to the Archives. A massive, circular chamber, the rotundas arching doorways stretched to the ceiling, granting anyone in the area a view of the entire Archives room. Terminals in the rotunda allowed Jedi to access any of the four halls, narrowing their searches to a specific area. Carpeted in red, the chambers centerpiece was a large database station used by the Chief Librarian to keep record of the books stored in the Stacks.\n\n\u2022 The First Hall\n\nKnown as the main entrance to the Archives due to the great, hand-carved wooden doors at its front, the First Hall contained great records on philosophy and manuscripts detailing the history of the Republic. Personal journals of over a billion Jedi were also held here. While on missions, Jedi such as Mace WinduShatterpoint and Quinlan Vos would sometimes record their thoughts and would turn them over to the Archives for review by future Jedi. Many of the more in-depth works on Force abilities were restricted to Jedi Masters; Padawans required permission from the Chief Librarian to delve into the more controversial works.Legacy of the Jedi\n\n\u2022 The Second Hall\n\nRunning perpendicular to the first and third halls, the Second Hall contained data dedicated to mathematical and engineering sciences. Works related to the topics on hyperspace and how to achieve it and construct engines and vehicles capable of such feats were among the blue-glowing Stacks. Floor-plans of the galaxys government buildings and other points of interest were found here, along with many manufacturers weapon designs. The computer systems here had readouts on all Temple activities including a databank dedicated to the Jedi High Council's current seating arrangements. Splitting into two aisles, the hall had access ways into the two Holocron Vaults on that end of the chamber.\n\n\u2022 The Third Hall\n\nThe Third Hall was directly opposite the first and was filled with information on the geography and culture of every known planet in the Galactic Republic. It included starmaps of interstellar and planetary regions, and detailed analyses on specific civilizations. The ExplorCorps often contributed to this section, adding new planetary details as worlds were discovered beyond the Republic's reach.\nJust before the Clone Wars, somewhere between 32 and 22 BBY, information within the Third Halls scope of knowledge concerning the planet Kamino, the Kaminoans, and their cloning industry was erased. Former Jedi Master Count Dooku secretly committed this act in order to conceal the creation of the Clone Army from the Jedi Council. This was uncovered by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi when he tried to identify the origin of Galactic Senator Amidalas would-be assassin, who used a Kaminoan saber dart. This discovery eventually led to the uncovering of the Confederacy of Independent Systems' plans for war, putting into motion the Clone Wars.\n\n\u2022 The Fourth Hall\n\nAhsoka Tano talking to Madame Jocasta Nu\nThe Fourth Hall, running on the same plane as the second, was also split into two smaller wings; each dedicated to zoological research relating information on every known species of flora and fauna in the galaxy. It was within these stacks in the year 990 BBY, that Darth Zannah, disguised as Jedi apprentice Nalia Adollu, researched the crustaceous orbalisks, a task she had undertaken in order to save her master, Darth Banes, life. With a reference disk provided by then-Chief Archivist Barra-Rona-Ban she was able to uncover the secret to their removal in a text written by Dr. Osaf Hamud. The visiting Darovit, Zannahs cousin, discovered her, and because she had found what she was looking for, she kidnapped him and fled. In her rush, she had forgotten the datadisk with all of her information, and the Jedi, led by Valenthyne Farfalla, were able to track her back to her master on Tython.\nIn 22 BBY, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious concocted a scheme to raise an army of Dark Jedi. As the Clone Wars drew so many Jedi from the Temple, it would be easier to infiltrate one of the Holocron Vaults in the Temple. Selecting the Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane, Sidious supplied Bane with schematics of the Temple and a large supply of credits and ordered him to retrieve the Acquisition Division's holocron. In order to complete the mission, Bane killed Master Bolla Ropal in order to secure the Kyber memory crystal, the activating device for the holocron. Then, after aquuiring the body of Master Ord Enisence, Bane hired fellow bounty hunter Cato Parasitti to provide tactical support as he prepared to enter the Jedi stronghold. The two bounty hunters, accompanied by the droid Todo 360, set off to the Temple, Parasitti disguised as Enisence via her Clawdite shape-shifting talents.\nOnce inside, Parasitti, still disguised as the Skrilling Jedi, made it past the Archives guard and set up at a console by one of the vaults. Communicating via comlink with Bane, she directed him through the ventilation shafts on the roof of the Temple Ziggurat using the schematics provided by Sidious. With all her focus on the data terminal, Parasitti failed to see the approaching Madame Jocasta Nu. Having noticed Parasittis short temper when talking to Guard Ahsoka Tano earlier, Nu had hoped to comfort the odd-acting Enisence. Startled, Parasitti struck Nu, knocking her unconscious. Mimicking Nu's form, Parasitti resumed her efforts in directing Bane. As the Duros successfully captured the holocron, the Temple went on high alert. After a short duel, Ahsoka Tano apprehended Parasitti, though Bane escaped with the holocron without a fight.\nLater that year, Padawan Tano sought guidance in the Archives after petty thief Bannamu absconded with her lightsaber while she and her master were on assignment in the Coruscant underworld. Searching for a lead, she was directed by Madame Nu to the ancient Master Tera Sinube, who was napping in the chamber. Sinube had compiled a massive database of the crime on Coruscant, adding to the wealth of knowledge already stored in the Archives' Stacks. After identifying the Patrolian that had stolen the lightsaber, the two Jedi went off to find it.Lightsaber Lost\n\n\u2022 The Chief Librarian's quarters\n\nThe Chief Librarian who oversaw the Archives night and day had their own private office off of the main halls of the great collection of knowledge. During Master Barra-Rona-Ban's time as Chief Librarian, he had a small desk covered in neat piles of notes and datacard. Along one of the walls was a viewscreen and terminal with hook-ups to the main index catalog: allowing Master Ban to reference any material at will.\nThe Chief Archivist, while answering directly to the Council of First Knowledge, was also responsible for briefing Jedi who were preparing for missions; gathering data beforehand and presenting it in a quick session. From their quarters they could quickly created a portfolio and transmit it to the Jedi High Council for review and to help them reach a more informed decision.Jedi Apprentice: The Only Witness\n\n\u2022 Study halls\n\nStudy areas separated the Archives halls, and consisted of several desks and computers.Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows' The Archives were equipped with private rooms used for diligent researches that went days without sleep. The Chief Archivist would also present information here for Jedi preparing for missions. Service hallways ran adjacent to all of the halls, allowing members of the Temple Security Force to patrol without being seen. During the raid on the Jedi Temple by Darth Vader, the Sith Lord entered through a study hall to break into a Security station. After slaughtering the guards stationed there, Vader disabled a ray shield that inhibited his path on the way to the hangars.\n\n\u2022 Staff\n\nduring the Clone Wars.]]\nOverseen by the Council of First Knowledge, the Archives was directly run by the Chief Librarian. While not necessarily a Council member themselves, the Chief Librarian organized a staff of Lore Keepers to maintain the Stacks and update them with new information. Additionally, the Archives employed several JN-66 and SP-4 analysis droids. These droids wandered the Stacks in the main hall assisting those Jedi in need of direction.\nThe last in a long line of Chief Librarians, Madame Jocasta Nu, a former High Council member ran the Archives until the night of Operation: Knightfall. Sensing the fate that would soon befall her collections, she dutifully summoned her last Padawan, Jin-Lo Rayce to take secret information from the Archives offworld. Taking the tunnels out of the Temple, Rayce managed to survive, founding the Agents of Ossus as a way of protecting the information until the Order could be rebuilt.The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe Jedi Archives in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones is an almost exact digital reconstruction of the Long Room of Library of Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. Its imitation extends to the busts of the Lost Twenty, which, in Trinity Library, are busts of alumni, including writer Jonathan Swift.\nAccording to Pablo Helman on the Attack of the Clones DVD commentary, during the scene where Obi-Wan Kenobi speaks to Jocasta Nu, the room include busts of himself, George Lucas, Rob Coleman, and John Knoll.\nThe novel The Clone Wars: Wild Space erroneously states that the Jedi Archives are located within a third of Tranquillity Spire.\nThe touch-screen keyboards of the library's computers in \"Holocron Heist\" use the Aurebesh symbols in alphabetical order, but display all symbols upside down. Whether this was done intentionally or if it was a mistake by the animators is not known.\nThe second book of the Fate of the Jedi series, Fate of the Jedi: Omen, has a discrepancy in the layout of the Archives. The first chapter states that Jedi Jysella Horn ascends a turbolift from the Jedi Temple Main Entrance hall to reach the First Hall of the Archives, located on the uppermost levels of the Temple. However, in the second chapter of the same book, Jedi Horn is now on the fourth floor of the previously two-story Archives chamber. After descending over the walkways of the other floors, she lands on the first level and runs out of the Archives into the main hall from which she can see the Processional Way. This discrepancy is never explained.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nStar Wars: The Force Unleashed novelization]] Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (unabridged audiobook)\n\u2022 Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Exile Jedi library\n\n\u2022 Legacy of the Force: Fury\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Outcast Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Omen Fate of the Jedi: Omen (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Abyss Fate of the Jedi: Abyss (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Backlash Fate of the Jedi: Backlash (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Ascension Fate of the Jedi: Ascension (audiobook) library\n\n\u2022 Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Non-canon appearances\n\n\u2022 Tag & Bink: Revenge of the Clone Menace\n\n\u2022 Jedi Academy: Return of the Padawan\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nThe Journal of Master Gnost-Dural]]\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Legendary Yoda\n\n\u2022 Jocasta Nu\n\n\u2022 Nexus of Power\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",

The region around the Valley was typical of the planets landscape: rocky, scree-covered foothills, mesas and canyons, and nearby were rocky piles of rubble.Dark Forces: Rebel Agent The cave complex that formed the necropolis was far from the rich metal deposits of Ruusan.Dark Forces: Jedi KnightDark Forces: Jedi Knight' audio drama\nThe Convergence of the Force energy caused several phenomena to the geographic region around the Valley, observable by living creatures, especially Force-sensitives. Morgan Katarn felt the air thicker than normal, then a tickling in the back of his mind, becoming a steady hum, tingling on the skin and nervousness, including a desire to run away. Moaning voices, \"heard\" from within, move ones consciousness, causing headache and overwhelming emotions. The young Dark Jedi Yun in the vicinity of the Valley found easier to concentrate his thought and manifest it into energy. Jerecs men who were stationed could be annoyed, harassed and possessed by the loud apparitions of restless spirits, dubbed \"screamers\" by Jerec's men.\nThe entrance of the Valley was an open area surrounded by rock formations that towered above as if sentinel statues; an ancient roadbed led there. The area was actually the roof of a cavern, with a collapsed ragged opening, half a kilometer across. It was the only source of light below. Stairs, curving to the right, led to an arch, and the caverns floor. The monument itself consisted of hundreds of slabs, made from the chambers ceiling, spires with hieroglyphics, statues, tombs, even miniature temples. Radiating from the Valley were corridors leading to satellite caverns where several artifacts had been deposited and stored. At least one aqueduct brought rain water into the Valley.\nAround the Valley the Imperial Remnant under Jerec built a garrison of prefab buildings, a docking tower with platforms, Stormtroopers, AT-STs, shuttles, TIEs and attack droids that guarded the perimeter. The tower served also as docking station for freighters that were loaded with archaeological loot and returned to their fleet. Before going to orbit, ships had to fly through a maze of canyons before emerging to the desert.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 A monument to the Army of Light\n\nDarth Bane: Path of Destruction\nin the valley.]]\nAt the close of the New Sith Wars, the Brotherhood of Darkness's situation had become so fragile that their leader, Lord Kaan, resorted to the use of a thought bomb to end the war.\nLuring the Jedi deep into one of Ruusans caves, Kaan and his Brotherhood detonated the thought bomb, hoping to wipe out Jedi Lord Hoths Army of Light.

These updates have continued as recently as [[November 20]], [[2023]].<ref name=\"EAWSteamUpdates\">{{WebCite|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/32470/STAR_WARS_Empire_at_War__Gold_Pack|text=STAR WARS\u2122 Empire at War - Gold Pack|archivedate=20231120231513}}</ref>\n==Plot==\n===Rebel Alliance Campaign===\n====Opening crawl====\n{{Opening_crawl\n|name=Empire at War\n|text=Rebellion!

Instead of building workers, gathering resources, and recruiting individual units, players are granted resources based on how many planets the player controls. Controlling worlds increases a player's cash flow and provides unique bonuses depending on the planet (e.g., Armor increases, discounted prices, special unit production).\n\n[[File:EaWold.jpg|right|thumb|Targeting an enemy's starship hardpoints to destroy that hardpoint is essential to destroying the vessel.]]\nBattles are carried out both on a planet's surface and in orbit. Whoever controls the planet's surface, controls the planet itself. There are different factors to keep in mind depending on your status as an attacker or defender. Attackers must secure Reinforcement Points to increase the number of units they deploy, while Defenders may deploy up to 10 \"units\" on a planet immediately. Attackers have their advantages, though. They may call in [[bombing run]]s if they have Bombers in orbit. Likewise, ground-based installations (like the [[V-150 Planet Defender/Legends|Ion cannon]] and [[HVs-2 hypervelocity gun|Hypervelocity gun]]) can fire upon units in orbit during space tactical battles. Unlike in ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'', shields will form an actual physical barrier that must be penetrated and protect bases from artillery and bombing runs. Assorted building pads litter the playing field in both space and land battles. These pads allow the player to build useful structures (e.g., turrets which can easily destroy enemy units, [[bacta]] healing stations).\n\n[[File:SBattle.jpg|left|thumb|An [[Alliance Space Station]] under attack]]\n[[File:ThetaClassBarges-EaW.jpg|right|thumb|[[Theta-class barge/Legends|AT-AT Barges]] as seen in the game]]\n''Empire at War'' takes place between [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Episode III]] and [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|Episode IV]], concluding with the construction and possible destruction of the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]]. ''Empire at War'' features three factions, although only two are playable. These factions are the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], and the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] (playable with [[Wikipedia:XML|XML]] modding; see below). Units in this game are a mix of [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]&ndash;era and [[New Order/Legends|New Order]]&ndash;era. The Empire's advantages include powerful ships and swarms of [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter/Legends|TIE Fighters]], while the Rebels, on the other hand, must rely on swifter ships and Raid Fleets (small ground troop fleets that can bypass space defenses). Like many RTS games, ''Empire at War'' features a \"rock-paper-scissors\" unit usage style&mdash;for every unit there is a counter-unit. [[Brett Tosti]], the [[LucasArts]] producer, has stated that this encourages players to create diverse armies and fleets with units that counter other units, as opposed to building a bunch of \"super units.\"\n\nPlayers are also able to call on reinforcements during battle, including heroes like [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Players can also construct planet-borne ion cannons, factories, and space stations. Over forty locales are featured, including [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]], and others from the movies and [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]].\n\nThe destruction of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] cannot be prevented regardless of the player's actions.\n\n===Endings===\nThere are two different endings to ''Empire at War''{{'s}} campaign mode depending on the side the player chooses to fight for. The end of the Rebel campaign closely follows the ending of Episode IV. A cutscene shows Luke Skywalker's X-wing destroying the Death Star and the award ceremony that follows. However, this ending should not necessarily be treated as canonical, as the final battle with the Death Star can take place over any planet in the game. Moreover, it is still possible for the Rebellion to \"win,\" even if the Empire destroys other planets besides Alderaan, including Yavin 4.\n\nThe end of the Imperial campaign is non-canonical, as it is intended to be more of an \"alternate history\" in the vein of the [[Infinities]] universe. The ending cutscene depicts Darth Vader leading a ground assault on what is presumed to be the main Rebel base. The Rebel defenders are quickly crushed as Vader orders his troops to move in. If the player uses the Death Star in the final battle, the game plays a different cutscene where Moff Tarkin fires the superlaser against the last Rebel world. Afterwards, a shuttle is seen flying to the Death Star, flanked by six TIE Fighters. In a scene reminiscent of the Emperor's arrival in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|Episode VI]], an assembly of Imperial troops is shown waiting in one of the battlestation's hangars for the shuttle to land. As the shuttle deposits its contingent of Royal Guards, the Emperor disembarks, greeted by a kneeling Lord Vader. Palpatine congratulates Vader, claiming that the last Jedi and the Rebellion are defeated, and that it is all as he had foreseen.\n\nTwo other non-canon endings can be seen in Galactic Conquest mode. If the Rebels defeat the Empire without destroying the Death Star, or the player loses the game as the Empire, the ending cutscene depicts a pitched space battle over an [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]], presumably Coruscant. A Rebel fleet closes in on an Imperial Star Destroyer with Darth Vader aboard. As the Imperial defense crumbles, Vader chokes the Star Destroyer's captain for his apparent incompetence and escapes in his [[TIE Advanced x1/Legends|TIE Advanced x1]] moments before the ship is destroyed. From there, the same award ceremony cutscene follows that was in the campaign ending. Also, if the Empire destroys the last Rebel planet/one with Mon Mothma on it, the battle will be replaced by the Death Star destroying a planet, followed by the Death Star cutscene.\n\n==Demo==\nBefore the full game, a demo version was released. It consists of one Galactic Conquest mode not featured in the full version. In this mode only three planets and a few units are available. The story is set sometime after the establishment of [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base]] on [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] as the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] learns about an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] base in the [[Vergesso Asteroids/Legends|Vergesso asteroid belt]]. Fearing that it may detect their presence, the Rebels send [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] to deal with it. After the base is destroyed, Han is sent on a mission to liberate [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. There he finds out that the Imperial forces are commanded by [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]. The demo ends after the player captured the planet. This may contradict other sources, as Tatooine appears under Imperial control until after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], though it is possible that the planet was contested or recaptured later.\n\n==Continuity==\nThe game has several inconsistencies with established canon. Some of those in the following list may be an issue of game balance or mechanics.\n*[[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] was discovered during the siege of an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] space station over [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]].\n*A-wings are in use in the early Galactic Civil War. The [[R-22 Spearhead starfighter|R-22 Spearhead]] [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] partially reconciles this frequent inconsistency.\n*[[Raymus Antilles/Legends|Antilles]], [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] all partake in a mission to [[Wayland/Legends|Wayland]], the [[Palpatine/Legends|Emperor's]] secret storehouse. No one in the Rebellion had heard of the planet, let alone operated on it, until the [[Thrawn campaign]].\n*Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|troops]] deploy from the [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT's]] underbelly rather than the sides.\n*Several ship armaments and hard points do not match up with the descriptions of the ships. For example, the batteries on the side of an [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] are made up of turbolasers rather than ion cannons. [[DP20 gunship/Legends|Corellian gunships]] are stated in the game to have four banks of concussion-missile launchers and two laser cannons, when earlier published games and media state it has eight double turbolaser turrets, six quad laser turrets and four concussion-missile launchers. Capital starships also have far fewer weapons than canon sources indicate. This is possibly to cut costs and increase game performance, preventing hundreds of guns per ship from overloading most computers. It is also possible that this is to have balance.\n*Several ships have more or fewer weapon hard points than stated in other sources, such as the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate/Legends|EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates]] having two turbolaser and two laser-cannon batteries and the [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-class Star Destroyer's]] two enhanced turbolasers and single ion-cannon battery.\n*[[Proton torpedo/Legends|Proton torpedoes]] are falsely declared to be able to penetrate any shields, instead of simply being limited use heavy ordnance. This change was likely made for game balance, making bombers useful for taking out key hardpoints such as shield generators, engines, and hangars.\n*Most units in-game are poorly scaled, especially fighters and bombers during space battles, though this is mostly for game mechanics.\n*The locations of many of the planets in-game are not exact. An example is the population of the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] by well-known and canonically established planets, such as Taris and Thyferra. Differences such as these are due to game mechanics and are thus considered non-canon.\n\n==Legacy==\n===Modding===\n[[File:EaWEditorScreenshot.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The ''Empire at War'' map editor]]\nAs revealed in early press releases and interviews, ''EaW'' is marginally open source&mdash;with much of the game being controlled through [[Wikipedia:Text file|text files]] (*.txt), [[Wikipedia:Extensible Markup Language|XML]] files (*.xml), [[Wikipedia:DAT|DAT]] files (*.dat), and [[Wikipedia:Lua (programming language)|Lua]] (*.lua). Anyone with the knowledge and software needed to alter these files can do so.\n\nThe text files are easily edited in most text-editing programs and control the unique ship names that appear on many of the capital ships as well as a fair amount of the stories used throughout the Galactic Conquest mode. The XML files control much of the data responsible for the appearance and behavior of units and buildings. These files are often, by default, launched in a web browser which allows for viewing only. WYSIWYG web editors (e.g., [[Wikipedia:Microsoft Expression Web|Microsoft Expression Web]] or [[Wikipedia:Adobe Dreamweaver|Adobe Dreamweaver]]), text editors such as Notepad, or proprietary XML editors can edit XML (though the latter two are most common due to their relative ease of use).\n\n[[File:TIEIALOViewer.png|thumb|left|200px|A wireframe [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE Interceptor]] from the fan-made ALO viewer]]\n\nDAT files require software capable of reading the information embedded within. In ''Empire at War'', DAT files store almost all of the text found within the game. Lastly, the Lua files are used primarily for high-level scripting and AI. The decompiled files come with the Map Editor, and can replace the scripts in the EAW directory without having to compile them.\n\nIt is now possible to create new ground and space maps with the map editor released by Petroglyph. Included in the map-editor download is a plug-in for [[Wikipedia:3ds Max|3ds Max]] 6 that can export models into .alo format used by the [[Alamo]] engine. However, 3ds Max 8 users who patch their software to the Service Pack 3 version are able to use the separately released 3ds Max 8 exporter in conjunction with the shaders provided with the map editor. Modified shaders created by ''EaW'' modder Mike.nl fixes an issue where the models in the viewports using Rskn shaders are invisible. 3ds Max 8 SP 3 is also necessary in order to use the exporter included with the ''Forces of Corruption'' map editor.\n\nThe community has been pressing forward in terms of modding, going so far as to implement diplomacy, create new particles, and even have detachments of transports assigned to a specific fleet in Galactic Conquest mode. Some fan-made programs assist with the editing of what can be edited, such as an .alo file viewer and importer.\n\n==Credits==\n{{Credits\n|cast=\n*[[Brian Bascle]] as [[Kyle Katarn]] / [[Rebel pilot/Legends|Rebel Pilot]] / [[Rebel trooper/Legends|Rebel Trooper]] / Additional Voices (voice)\n*[[Carolyn Seymour]] as [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] (voice)\n*[[Chris Cox]] as Rebel Trooper / [[X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-Wing]] Pilot / Additional Voices (voice)\n*[[Corey Burton]] as Tie Fighter Pilot / [[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter/Legends|V-Wing]] Pilot / Additional Voices (voice)\n*[[Denny Delk]] as Narrator (voice)\n*[[Edmund Dehn]] as Commander [[Gial Ackbar|Ackbar]] (voice)\n*[[Gary Martin]] as [[Immobilizer 418 Interdictor-class Heavy Cruiser|Interdictor Cruiser]] / [[TIE ap-1|TIE Mauler]] Commander / Additional Voices (voice)\n*[[Grant Albrecht|J.

    "plain_text": "rwm\nbooster pack]] for Star Wars: Destiny by Fantasy Flight Games\n0 BBY]]The campaign of Star Wars: Empire at War finishes with the Battle of Yavin, which The New Essential Chronology dates to 0 BBY.\nStar Wars: Empire at War (sometimes abbreviated EaW) is a Real-time strategy (RTS) video game developed by Petroglyph and published by LucasArts, that takes place in the Star Wars universe. Originally announced for a fall 2005 release, the game was released on February 16, 2006.\nPromising to end the perceived mediocrity of past Star Wars RTS games (like Star Wars: Force Commander and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds), Empire at War started from the ground up. The game was developed by Petroglyph, comprising many former members of Westwood Studios (known for the Command & Conquer series). Petroglyph developed a completely new engine specifically for EaW known as Alamo. It uses several higher-end shader effects such as soft shadows, specular lighting, and particle effects for dust clouds and explosions.\nThe game spawned a sizeable mod community, and was followed up by an expansion pack, Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption, taking place between the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor. Starting in 2017, the title and its expansion have received occasional official support for its Steam release, including updated multiplayer support, community mod support, an update to a 64-bit architecture, and numerous bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. These updates have continued as recently as November 20, 2023.\n\n\u2022 Plot\n\n\u2022 Rebel Alliance Campaign\n\n\u2022 Opening crawl\n\n\u2022 Missions\n\n\u2022 Assault on Kashyyyk (Tutorial mission)\n\n\u2022 Shipyard Diversion\n\n\u2022 Interpreting the Network\n\n\u2022 Theft of the X-Wing\n\n\u2022 Kessel Rescue\n\n\u2022 Imperial Liberation\n\n\u2022 Highest Bidder\n\n\u2022 Rescue the Millennium Falcon\n\n\u2022 Needle in a Haystack\n\n\u2022 Borrowed Time\n\n\u2022 Handle with Care!\n\n\u2022 The Defense of Mon Calamari\n\n\u2022 The Final Battle\n\n\u2022 Galactic Empire Campaign\n\n\u2022 Opening crawl\n\n\u2022 Missions\n\n\u2022 Battle of Ryloth (Tutorial mission)\n\n\u2022 Taking Thyferra\n\n\u2022 Crush.

Instead of building workers, gathering resources, and recruiting individual units, players are granted resources based on how many planets the player controls. Controlling worlds increases a player's cash flow and provides unique bonuses depending on the planet (e.g., Armor increases, discounted prices, special unit production).\nBattles are carried out both on a planets surface and in orbit. Whoever controls the planets surface, controls the planet itself. There are different factors to keep in mind depending on your status as an attacker or defender. Attackers must secure Reinforcement Points to increase the number of units they deploy, while Defenders may deploy up to 10 \"units\" on a planet immediately. Attackers have their advantages, though. They may call in bombing runs if they have Bombers in orbit. Likewise, ground-based installations (like the Ion cannon and Hypervelocity gun) can fire upon units in orbit during space tactical battles. Unlike in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, shields will form an actual physical barrier that must be penetrated and protect bases from artillery and bombing runs. Assorted building pads litter the playing field in both space and land battles. These pads allow the player to build useful structures (e.g., turrets which can easily destroy enemy units, bacta healing stations).\nunder attack]]\nas seen in the game]]\nEmpire at War takes place between Episode III and Episode IV, concluding with the construction and possible destruction of the Death Star. Empire at War features three factions, although only two are playable. These factions are the Rebel Alliance, the Galactic Empire, and the Black Sun (playable with XML modding; see below). Units in this game are a mix of Clone Wars&ndash;era and New Order&ndash;era. The Empires advantages include powerful ships and swarms of TIE Fighters, while the Rebels, on the other hand, must rely on swifter ships and Raid Fleets (small ground troop fleets that can bypass space defenses). Like many RTS games, Empire at War' features a \"rock-paper-scissors\" unit usage style&mdash;for every unit there is a counter-unit. Brett Tosti, the LucasArts producer, has stated that this encourages players to create diverse armies and fleets with units that counter other units, as opposed to building a bunch of \"super units.\"\nPlayers are also able to call on reinforcements during battle, including heroes like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Players can also construct planet-borne ion cannons, factories, and space stations. Over forty locales are featured, including Yavin 4, Tatooine, Dagobah, and others from the movies and Expanded Universe.\nThe destruction of Alderaan cannot be prevented regardless of the player's actions.\n\n\u2022 Endings\n\nThere are two different endings to Empire at War campaign mode depending on the side the player chooses to fight for. The end of the Rebel campaign closely follows the ending of Episode IV. A cutscene shows Luke Skywalkers X-wing destroying the Death Star and the award ceremony that follows. However, this ending should not necessarily be treated as canonical, as the final battle with the Death Star can take place over any planet in the game. Moreover, it is still possible for the Rebellion to \"win,\" even if the Empire destroys other planets besides Alderaan, including Yavin 4.\nThe end of the Imperial campaign is non-canonical, as it is intended to be more of an \"alternate history\" in the vein of the Infinities universe. The ending cutscene depicts Darth Vader leading a ground assault on what is presumed to be the main Rebel base. The Rebel defenders are quickly crushed as Vader orders his troops to move in. If the player uses the Death Star in the final battle, the game plays a different cutscene where Moff Tarkin fires the superlaser against the last Rebel world. Afterwards, a shuttle is seen flying to the Death Star, flanked by six TIE Fighters. In a scene reminiscent of the Emperors arrival in Episode VI, an assembly of Imperial troops is shown waiting in one of the battlestations hangars for the shuttle to land. As the shuttle deposits its contingent of Royal Guards, the Emperor disembarks, greeted by a kneeling Lord Vader. Palpatine congratulates Vader, claiming that the last Jedi and the Rebellion are defeated, and that it is all as he had foreseen.\nTwo other non-canon endings can be seen in Galactic Conquest mode. If the Rebels defeat the Empire without destroying the Death Star, or the player loses the game as the Empire, the ending cutscene depicts a pitched space battle over an ecumenopolis, presumably Coruscant. A Rebel fleet closes in on an Imperial Star Destroyer with Darth Vader aboard. As the Imperial defense crumbles, Vader chokes the Star Destroyer's captain for his apparent incompetence and escapes in his TIE Advanced x1 moments before the ship is destroyed. From there, the same award ceremony cutscene follows that was in the campaign ending. Also, if the Empire destroys the last Rebel planet/one with Mon Mothma on it, the battle will be replaced by the Death Star destroying a planet, followed by the Death Star cutscene.\n\n\u2022 Demo\n\nBefore the full game, a demo version was released. It consists of one Galactic Conquest mode not featured in the full version. In this mode only three planets and a few units are available. The story is set sometime after the establishment of Echo Base on Hoth as the Rebel Alliance learns about an Imperial base in the Vergesso asteroid belt. Fearing that it may detect their presence, the Rebels send Han Solo to deal with it. After the base is destroyed, Han is sent on a mission to liberate Tatooine. There he finds out that the Imperial forces are commanded by Boba Fett. The demo ends after the player captured the planet. This may contradict other sources, as Tatooine appears under Imperial control until after the Battle of Endor, though it is possible that the planet was contested or recaptured later.\n\n\u2022 Continuity\n\nThe game has several inconsistencies with established canon. Some of those in the following list may be an issue of game balance or mechanics.\n\u2022 Gial Ackbar was discovered during the siege of an Imperial space station over Corulag.\n\n\u2022 A-wings are in use in the early Galactic Civil War. The R-22 Spearhead retcon partially reconciles this frequent inconsistency.\n\n\u2022 Antilles, R2-D2, and C-3PO all partake in a mission to Wayland, the Emperor's secret storehouse. No one in the Rebellion had heard of the planet, let alone operated on it, until the Thrawn campaign.\n\n\u2022 Imperial troops deploy from the AT-AT's underbelly rather than the sides.\n\n\u2022 Several ship armaments and hard points do not match up with the descriptions of the ships. For example, the batteries on the side of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer are made up of turbolasers rather than ion cannons. Corellian gunships are stated in the game to have four banks of concussion-missile launchers and two laser cannons, when earlier published games and media state it has eight double turbolaser turrets, six quad laser turrets and four concussion-missile launchers. Capital starships also have far fewer weapons than canon sources indicate. This is possibly to cut costs and increase game performance, preventing hundreds of guns per ship from overloading most computers. It is also possible that this is to have balance.\n\n\u2022 Several ships have more or fewer weapon hard points than stated in other sources, such as the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates having two turbolaser and two laser-cannon batteries and the Victory-class Star Destroyer's two enhanced turbolasers and single ion-cannon battery.\n\n\u2022 Proton torpedoes are falsely declared to be able to penetrate any shields, instead of simply being limited use heavy ordnance. This change was likely made for game balance, making bombers useful for taking out key hardpoints such as shield generators, engines, and hangars.\n\n\u2022 Most units in-game are poorly scaled, especially fighters and bombers during space battles, though this is mostly for game mechanics.\n\n\u2022 The locations of many of the planets in-game are not exact. An example is the population of the Unknown Regions by well-known and canonically established planets, such as Taris and Thyferra. Differences such as these are due to game mechanics and are thus considered non-canon.\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\n\u2022 Modding\n\nAs revealed in early press releases and interviews, EaW is marginally open source&mdash;with much of the game being controlled through text files (*.txt), XML files (*.xml), DAT files (*.dat), and Lua (*.lua). Anyone with the knowledge and software needed to alter these files can do so.\nThe text files are easily edited in most text-editing programs and control the unique ship names that appear on many of the capital ships as well as a fair amount of the stories used throughout the Galactic Conquest mode. The XML files control much of the data responsible for the appearance and behavior of units and buildings. These files are often, by default, launched in a web browser which allows for viewing only. WYSIWYG web editors (e.g., Microsoft Expression Web or Adobe Dreamweaver), text editors such as Notepad, or proprietary XML editors can edit XML (though the latter two are most common due to their relative ease of use).\nfrom the fan-made ALO viewer]]\nDAT files require software capable of reading the information embedded within. In Empire at War, DAT files store almost all of the text found within the game. Lastly, the Lua files are used primarily for high-level scripting and AI. The decompiled files come with the Map Editor, and can replace the scripts in the EAW directory without having to compile them.\nIt is now possible to create new ground and space maps with the map editor released by Petroglyph. Included in the map-editor download is a plug-in for 3ds Max 6 that can export models into .alo format used by the Alamo engine. However, 3ds Max 8 users who patch their software to the Service Pack 3 version are able to use the separately released 3ds Max 8 exporter in conjunction with the shaders provided with the map editor. Modified shaders created by EaW modder Mike.nl fixes an issue where the models in the viewports using Rskn shaders are invisible. 3ds Max 8 SP 3 is also necessary in order to use the exporter included with the Forces of Corruption map editor.\nThe community has been pressing forward in terms of modding, going so far as to implement diplomacy, create new particles, and even have detachments of transports assigned to a specific fleet in Galactic Conquest mode. Some fan-made programs assist with the editing of what can be edited, such as an .alo file viewer and importer.\n\n\u2022 Credits\n\nC-3PO]] / Additional Voices (voice)\n\u2022 Wayne Grace as Alliance Shuttle / Gallofree Transport (voice)\n\n\u2022 Christopher Corey Smith as Rebel Briefing Commander / TIE Fighter Pilot / X-Wing Pilot / Imperial Soldier (voice)\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nWroshyr tree]]\n\n\u2022 Hidden items\n\nThe following are units and planets that were removed for the final version and are hidden or mentioned in the internal game files. Some have been unlocked via XML and MEG editing.

He has composed nearly all of the music heard in the Star Wars films. He has also composed scores for multiple other well-known movies and television shows, including Indiana Jones, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Superman. Williams announced his intention to retire from film score composing after the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in 2023 to focus more on composing independent orchestral and symphonic pieces, though he later rescinded this.\nIn September 2022, John Williams and former Disney chief Bob Iger were each made an honorary Knight of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II, with Williams being approved for his services to film music as a composer and conductor in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u2022 Biography\n\n]]\nIn 1977, he composed the music for Star Wars, which turned out to be a huge success. Star Wars became the best-selling score-only soundtrack of all time and won him an Oscar.\nWilliamss son, Joseph Williams, chose a musical career like his father. The two worked together on Return of the Jedi and Attack of the Clones'.\nRick McCallum stated at Star Wars Reunion II that he had hoped to have John Williams on the musical score for the Star Wars live-action TV series and added that each episode would have had its own original score.\nWilliams announced his intention to retire from film score composing after the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in 2023 to focus more on composing independent orchestral and symphonic pieces, though he later rescinded this.\n\n\u2022 Works\n\n\u2022 Discography\n\nBinary Sunset]]\n\u2022 Landspeeder Search/Attack of the Sand People\n\n\u2022 Tales of a Jedi Knight/Learn About the Force\n\n\u2022 Burning Homestead\n\n\u2022 Mos Eisley Spaceport\n\n\u2022 [[2017||Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi||off-screen performer for \"The Long Goodbye\"\n\n|-\n|2019||Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker||Oma Tres\n|}\n\n\u2022 Awards\n\n\u2022 Academy Awards\n\nclass=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:2px #aaa solid; font-size:90%;\"\n- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"'\n-\n1977\nStar Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\nBest Original Score\nwon\n-\n1980\nStar Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\nBest Original Score\nnom\n-\n1983\nStar Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\nBest Original Score\nnom\n-\n2015\nStar Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens\nBest Original Score\nnom\n-\n2017\nStar Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi\nBest Original Score\nnom\n-\n2019\nStar Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker\nBest Original Score\nnom\n\n\u2022 BAFTA Awards\n\nclass=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:2px #aaa solid; font-size:90%;\"\n- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n-\n1978\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\nOriginal Film Music\nwon\n-\n1980\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\nOriginal Film Music\nwon\n-\n2015\nStar Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens\nOriginal Film Music\nnom\n-\n2019\nStar Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker\nOriginal Film Music\nnom\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\n\u2022 IV\n\n\u2022 The Star Wars Album\n\n\u2022 The Jedi Master's Quizbook\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Dark Forces Official Player's Guide\n\n\u2022 We Don't Do Weddings: The Band's Tale audio drama\n\n\u2022 The Secrets of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Limited Collectors Edition\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film\n\n\u2022 Ambush\n\n\u2022 Rising Malevolence\n\n\u2022 Shadow of Malevolence\n\n\u2022 Lair of Grievous\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Year by Year: A Visual Chronicle\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga \u2013 The Official Collectors Edition\n\n\u2022 Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian: Making of the Season 2 Finale\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Lucasfilm Studio Showcase Recap &#124; Star Wars Celebration 2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Celebration Anaheim News and Reveals!\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The Mandalorian Season 3 Launch Event\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Indiana Jones is Back in Action, John Williams Performs, and More!\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 This or Hat, Indiana Jones 101, and More!\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Dispatch: The Phantom Menace Returns!\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The Acolyte &#124; Amandla & Her Violin &#124; Streaming June 4 on Disney+\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 The Acolyte &#124; Michael Abels - Finale &#124; Disney+\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event Recap &#124; Star Wars\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Music By John Williams &#124; Official Trailer &#124; Disney+\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 John Williams\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 JOHN WILLIAMS Fan Network\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 John Williams discography at Discogs",

Betrayal''',<ref name=\"end\" /> and '''The Curse of [[Qalydon/Legends|Qalydon]]''',<ref name=\"end\" /> was the name given to the thousand [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of conflict between the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and the [[New Sith]], which lasted from approximately [[2000 BBY/Legends|2000]] to [[1000 BBY/Legends|1000 BBY]]. As an era, the New Sith Wars were characterized by a spectacular rise of the Sith, the decline of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], and a growing militancy in the Jedi Order. The balance between the Sith and the Republic fluctuated during the period, and at several periods, especially after the pivotal [[Battle of Mizra]], the Republic was in danger of being overwhelmed completely.\n\nCoinciding with the [[Draggulch Period]] of galactic history, the New Sith Wars were usually divided by historians into a series of shorter conflicts for convenience, such as the [[Sictis Wars]]. The last century of the conflict was commonly known as the [[Republic Dark Age]], and the name [[Light and Darkness War]] was sometimes specifically applied to the final series of battles between the Sith [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]] and the Jedi [[Army of Light/Legends|Army of Light]].\n\nThe wars themselves ended on [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]], where the Sith were presumed to have been wiped out to the last person and the Jedi and Republic felt themselves to be victorious. The Jedi and the Republic prepared themselves for a future of peace and prosperity, with the Sith nothing more than a painful memory of the past. This, however, was a dangerous delusion, as a single Sith, [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]], had in fact survived. Bane formed a new Sith Order and he and his successors spent the next thousand years in hiding, waiting to topple the Republic once and for all.\n\n==History==\n===Schism===\n{{Main|Fourth Great Schism}}\n{{Quote|There is no passion&hellip;there is solely obsession.<br />There is no knowledge.

The Sith, though exponentially increased in number, were divided against one another, as the various warlords and self-proclaimed Dark Lords fought each other for supremacy.

Standing as these systems' last line of defense, these individual Jedi became celebrated and quickly came to hold political might. As their constituent worlds came to appreciate their service, these Jedi became barons or kings of entire systems and sectors, taking up the title [[Jedi Lord]].<ref name=\"EGTW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref>\n\nEstablishing castles and manors as their formal residences, these Lords created a formal hereditary system, passing down their titles to their offspring for several generations. The peaceful regions of space stood as islands of light in the darkness created by the Sith, and even [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] was presided over by Jedi [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellors]]. During this time, the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] competed directly with the [[Jedi Grand Council]] which consisted of Lords from across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].<ref name=\"EGTW\" />\n\n====The Sith Civil War====\n{{Main|Sith civil war|Charge Matrica|Second Charge Matrica}}\nThe Sith saw the crippled Republic as a sign that [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] was with them.

In an attempt to end the internecine feuds that had torn their Empire apart, Kaan ended the tradition of a sole [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], and recognized each and every claim to the title by the rival warlords. Kaan forged his alliance with the creed of \"Rule by the Strong\" and \"All are equal in the Brotherhood of Darkness.\" He made his headquarters on the planet [[Roon/Legends|Roon]].<ref name=\"TEA\" />\n\nBeginning in around [[1010 BBY]], this new group launched a series of attacks designed to destroy the Jedi and the Republic. Kaan, along with the two strongest of the former warlords, [[Qordis]] and [[Kopecz]], began their campaign with a daring and symbolic assault on the ancient Sith homeworld of [[Korriban/Legends|Korriban]], which at that time was still under nominal Republic control. The successful capture of that world sealed their alliance, and enabled the reopening of the ancient [[Sith academy]] under Qordis' leadership.<ref name=\"pod\" />\n\nAs Qordis trained new recruits, Kaan and Kopecz continued their war, seizing worlds like [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], and even briefly [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]], [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] and [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]].

Though Hoth and his advisors found this distasteful, they reluctantly agreed to accept the child recruits, reasoning that it was better for them to be found by the Jedi than by Kaan's Sith.<ref name=\"Jedi vs. Sith\" />\n\nDissension was rife in both camps - for the Jedi, Hoth feuded with his fellow Lord Valenthyne Farfalla, a rift which only deepened with the death of [[Pernicar]], a Jedi Master who had mediated between the two Lords. Even when Farfalla arrived with over three hundred fresh knights as reinforcements, having both defeated the traitorous King [[Lahzar]] and broken the Sith blockade over Ruusan, Hoth still refused to speak to him.<ref name=\"Jedi vs. Sith\" />\n\nThe Jedi were further undermined when a new recruit, [[Darovit]] turned traitor, murdering General Charny and defecting to the Sith.<ref name=\"Jedi vs. Sith\" />\n\nAmong the Sith, Kaan's leadership began to be questioned by both Githany and Kopecz, and Kaan's bungled attempt to remove his rival [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]] only served to make him seem foolish, especially after Bane defeated Qordis, Kaan's strongest supporter. Bane mocked Kaan's reliance on traditional weapons of war, and goaded the Sith leader into using the dark side of the Force to destroy Hoth and the Jedi.

Lord Hoth, knowing of his opponent's final gambit, took 99 of his most trusted knights with him and confronted Kaan in an attempt to dissuade the Sith Lord from unleashing the weapon.

He aided Lord [[Hoth (Jedi Lord)|Hoth]] and the [[Army of Light/Legends|Army of Light]] in the [[Ruusan campaign]], in the final years of the Light and Darkness War. In the last year of the battle, Farfalla left [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]] to gather [[Farfalla's Knights|three hundred]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] to aid in the struggle for the world.<ref name=\"Jedi vs. Sith\" /><ref name=\"pod\" />\n\nFarfalla was often at odds with Hoth, and when the latter's good friend [[Pernicar]] was killed by the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], he blamed Farfalla and the two men had a falling out.

When Hoth and many other Jedi were killed by [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Lord]] [[Skere Kaan]]'s [[thought bomb]], Farfalla was left as the highest-ranking Jedi to survive Ruusan.<ref name=\"pod\" />\n\nFarfalla continued to serve the Jedi for a decade, until he was killed by [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]] in a [[Duel on Tython|lightsaber battle on Tython]].<ref name=\"Darth Bane: Rule of Two\" />\n\n===Darth Bane===\n[[File:DarthBane-TEA.jpg|125px|left]]\n{{Main|Darth Bane/Legends}}\nDarth Bane, born under the name of '''Dessel''', was the [[Sith'ari/Legends|Sith'ari]] and the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] responsible for creating the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]].<ref name=\"pod\" />\n\nRising from humble origins to join Kaan's Sith, he soon lost confidence in the Brotherhood of Darkness, believing Kaan to be a coward and a fool. Deserting the order, he provided Kaan with the secret of the thought bomb, thereby helping to destroy the Brotherhood, allowing him to create his own [[Sith Order]]. As the only survivor of the Ruusan campaign, Bane then instituted a Rule of Two, which stated that there could be only two Sith to avoid the infighting that had plagued the Sith for millennia. He styled himself as Darth Bane, and took as his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], whom he christened [[Darth Zannah/Legends|Darth Zannah]].<ref name=\"pod\" /> Zannah would eventually kill her master, taking his place as Sith Lord, but continuing his legacy.<ref name=\"Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil\" />\n\nNearly a [[19 BBY/Legends|millennium later]], Bane's Sith Order would [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|defeat]] the Jedi and [[Galactic Empire/Legends|overthrow]] the Republic.<ref name=\"nec\" />\n\n==Combatants==\n===Galactic Republic and Jedi Order===\n[[File:Hoth_and_Farfalla.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Jedi [[Army of Light/Legends|Army of Light]] during the [[Ruusan campaign]]]]\nWhen the Draggulch Period began, the Republic had been experiencing peace and prosperity for generations. With Darth Ruin's defection, however, it began to enter a period of decline and by the last century of the New Sith Wars had effectively collapsed, with the era being labeled a \"Dark Age\" by later historians.<ref name=\"nec\" />\n\nThe Jedi were tied to the Republic and, though they managed to avoid total collapse, were dragged down with the government they served. The collapse in confidence and strength in the Republic was so total after the Battle of Mizra that the Jedi were forced to assume complete control of the remnants of the government apparatus, serving as Chancellors for an unprecedented four centuries.<ref name=\"Darth Bane: Rule of Two\" /><ref name=\"nec\" /> Long after the war, while post-Ruusan historians and [[Galactic Empire/Legends|imperial]] propagandists emphasized the anarchy of those centuries, the also marked the period as the last great age of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights.]] Despite the widespread turmoil, many systems prospered under their rule.<ref name=\"nec\" />\n\n{{Main|Army of Light/Legends}}\nDuring the Light and Darkness War the Jedi Lord Hoth assumed complete control of the entire Republic military and succeeded in denting Kaan's advance. Kaan and Hoth faced off on Ruusan where both were destroyed by Kaan's use of the thought bomb. Valenthyne Farfalla took control of the surviving Jedi and declared victory, with the Sith assumed defeated. Farfalla helped Tarsus Valorum rise to the rank of Supreme Chancellor, the first non Jedi in that post for centuries, and together the pair enacted the Ruusan Reformations, marking the end of the Draggulch Period.<ref name=\"nec\" /><ref name=\"Darth Bane: Rule of Two\" /><ref name=\"Jedi vs. Sith\" />\n\n===Sith Order===\n[[File:BrotherhoodOfDarkness-BoS.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Members of the Sith [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]]]]\nThough Darth Ruin only initially attracted fifty fellow Jedi to his heresy,<ref name=\"tpmn\" /> the new Sith Order quickly grew in the ensuing centuries, and were soon able to challenge the Republic on their own terms.<ref name=\"nec\" /> Though Ruin was killed, his followers continued the war and a subsequent Dark Lord, the Dark Underlord, was able to consolidate these gains, terrorizing the galaxy with his followers, known as the Black Knights.<ref name=\"TEA\" />\n\nAfter Mizra, the Republic existed in little more than name only, and the Jedi were the true rivals to the Sith, organizing the resistance to the reign of Darth Rivan and Belia Darzu. During the Dark Age, the Sith holdings collapsed into rival, squabbling fiefs, constantly warring against each other, and a unified Sith threat did not exist until Kaan reunited the remnants into the Brotherhood of Darkness.<ref name=\"nec\" />\n\n{{Main|Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends}}\nKaan and his Brotherhood would achieve early success against the weakened Republic, and at one point were close to overwhelming the Core. The rise of the Jedi Lord Hoth to leadership of Republic and Jedi forces would change things, however, and the Jedi quickly took the initiative.<ref name=\"pod\" /> Kaan and Hoth faced each other on Ruusan in seven titanic battles until Kaan made the fateful decision to utilize the thought bomb. The Sith were completely wiped out, though the Jedi survived thanks to Lord Hoth's self sacrifice.

However, the subsequent infighting allowed the Hutts to move their goods and forces in place until the Sith either worked with them or were mercilessly destroyed. One such Hutt, [[Zodoh]], began to intrude upon Sith controlled space of the [[Bactranate]], starting with [[Aquilaris]], as he attempted to expand his business ventures. Without their Sith masters, the Hutt forces easily managed to overpower the Sith troops and began to deploy their atmospheric ''[[Stormdriver]]''.<ref name=\"SWKE1\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe development of the New Sith Wars' backstory is perhaps one of the more convoluted productions of the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]].\n\nThe first glimmer of what would become the war appeared in the video game ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]'', which featured the [[Valley of the Jedi]] as the location for a vague ancient battle between [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]]. ''[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent]]'' and ''[[Dark Forces: Jedi Knight]]'', novellas that retold the events of ''Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II'', extrapolated from the game, mainly introducing the Jedi [[Army of Light/Legends|Army of Light]] and its commander, [[Jedi Lord|Lord]] [[Hoth (Jedi Lord)|Hoth]], and the Dark Jedi [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]], under [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Skere Kaan]], as well as the [[thought bomb]], several ancillary characters, and a setting for the battle as having been fought \"centuries ago.\" In neither source was the Brotherhood stated as being Sith; instead, it was variously referred to as Dark Jedi, or just Jedi.<ref name=\"DF:RA\">''[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent]]''</ref><ref name=\"DF:JK\" />\nAt around the time ''Jedi Knight'' was published, [[George Lucas]] was developing a backstory of the Jedi and [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] for the [[prequel trilogy]] of films. His version, much of which appeared as exposition in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|''The Phantom Menace'' novelization]], states that the Sith were a formed from a Jedi Knight who broke away from the order and was corrupted by the dark side, two thousand years before the movies. Later the Sith massacred each other for power, leaving a Sith called Darth Bane as the sole survivor who developed the rule of two.<ref name=\"tpmn\" /> In the film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] this backstory is alluded to by [[Ki-Adi-Mundi/Legends|Ki-Adi-Mundi's]] comment that the Sith have been extinct \"for a millennium\" and [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] and [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda's]] comments about the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]] during the final scenes of the film.<ref name=\"tpm\" />\nIn the Expanded Universe material the first connection between the two events (the ''Jedi Knight'' backstory and Lucas' ''Episode I'' backstory) came a year after ''Episode I''{{'s}} release, in [[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]. ''The Essential Chronology'' established that the founder of the Sith was merely the founder of a new sect of Sith, the [[New Sith]] (in order to mesh with the established Expanded Universe). It slightly altered the timeline of Lucas's outline&mdash;following the Sith civil war, Kaan (now established as one of the few surviving Sith Lords) created the Brotherhood of Darkness (now established as a collection of Sith), with the Army of Light being hastily formed to deal with the new threat. Darth Bane was then established as the lone survivor of the Brotherhood's defeat at Ruusan.<ref name=\"The Essential Chronology\">[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]</ref>\n\nA year after ''The Essential Chronology'' came out, the comic ''[[Star Wars: Jedi vs. Sith]]'' was published.

The second arc in the comic series ''[[Star Wars: Knight Errant: Deluge]]'' introduced the concept of a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] crimelord as a archetype stock villain while exploring less ethical aspects of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] role in the conflict, particularly the roles of [[Grace Command]] and [[Operation Deluge]].<ref name=\"SWKE Deluge\">''[[Star Wars: Knight Errant: Deluge]]''</ref>\n\nOf lesser importance are the revelations that the New Sith Wars were responsible for the previously-established destruction of the [[Ubese/Legends|Ubese]] homeworld, and the construction of the Sith temple on [[Malrev IV]]. In addition, as with most major ''[[Star Wars]]'' events, a number of lesser events and personalities of the New Sith Wars have been covered by a variety of sourcebooks and articles. Notably, [[Abel G.

    "plain_text": "fga\nSith Wars]],\" \"The Betrayal (disambiguation)\" and \"Curse (disambiguation)\"\nHoth]]\nThe New Sith Wars, also known to the Sith as The War of the Fittest, The Betrayal, and The Curse of Qalydon, was the name given to the thousand years of conflict between the Jedi and the New Sith, which lasted from approximately 2000 to 1000 BBY. As an era, the New Sith Wars were characterized by a spectacular rise of the Sith, the decline of the Galactic Republic, and a growing militancy in the Jedi Order. The balance between the Sith and the Republic fluctuated during the period, and at several periods, especially after the pivotal Battle of Mizra, the Republic was in danger of being overwhelmed completely.\nCoinciding with the Draggulch Period of galactic history, the New Sith Wars were usually divided by historians into a series of shorter conflicts for convenience, such as the Sictis Wars. The last century of the conflict was commonly known as the Republic Dark Age, and the name Light and Darkness War was sometimes specifically applied to the final series of battles between the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness and the Jedi Army of Light.\nThe wars themselves ended on Ruusan, where the Sith were presumed to have been wiped out to the last person and the Jedi and Republic felt themselves to be victorious. The Jedi and the Republic prepared themselves for a future of peace and prosperity, with the Sith nothing more than a painful memory of the past. This, however, was a dangerous delusion, as a single Sith, Darth Bane, had in fact survived. Bane formed a new Sith Order and he and his successors spent the next thousand years in hiding, waiting to topple the Republic once and for all.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Schism\n\nFourth Great Schism\nEchoes of the Jedi\nFor almost a thousand years after the seventeenth and last Alsakan Conflict, the galaxy had enjoyed an era of relative peace and social and economic stability. The Sith Empire had vanished at some point following the third Galactic War sixteen hundred years prior, and what little remnants of that order existed, even Darth Desolous and the invasion of his army, would fail to defeat the now unchallenged, if complacent Jedi.\nDuring this period, a Jedi Master named Phanius resigned his commission, citing ideological objections to current Jedi dogma. Though his peers disagreed with his views, the parting was amicable, and Phanius would be commemorated as the first of the Lost Twenty, a special group of revered Jedi who had nevertheless felt the need to leave the Jedi Order over philosophical differences.Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\nBehind such amiability, however, the Umbaran Jedi harbored darker thoughts, ones unknown to his Jedi peers. His true reasons for abandoning his Jedi commitment was linked to his intention to pursue prohibited teachings. Phanius disappeared from public view, and when he re-emerged, it was as Darth Ruin, the first Dark Lord of the Sith in a thousand years, and preaching a creed of malevolent solipsism. Ruins transformation was total, and such was the disconnect between his original persona and his new mantle, that Ruins former Jedi peers never realized that their new foe was once their cherished friend, Phanius.\nDarth Ruins nascent order quickly grew&mdash;fifty Jedi Knights deserted to join shortly after,Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace novelization in an event that would be later labeled the Fourth Great Schism of 2000 BBY. He filled out the rest of his new orders ranks by first infiltrating and then uniting the surviving Sith clans under his own leadership.\nMerciless and supremely-self-centered, Ruins capricious and egocentric whims led to the deaths of many of his own followers and, eventually, Ruins single-mindedness proved to be his undoing&mdash;he was eventually killed by his minions after a defeat.Vader: The Ultimate Guide Despite Ruin's death, the rebirth of the Sith was complete.\n\n\u2022 Sith ascendancy\n\nBattle of Mizra\nIn the ensuing decades, the Sith quickly carved out a sprawling dominion, creating a New Sith Empire, and their relentless attacks wore away from the reeling Republic. They quickly recaptured traditional Sith worlds such as Yavin 4 and Ziost in initial attacks, solidifying a new empire in the north-east quadrant of the galaxy. Additionally, they secretly sabotaged the Republic's own defense.\nThe Jedi were frequently at the forefront of the Republic's war effort, though not always to their own benefit&mdash;a disastrous intervention to contain an outbreak of Ubese aggression in 1800 BBY at the Battle of Uba IV led to the destruction of a cache of superweapons. The resulting chemical release decimated the Ubese and led to accusations of xenocide that would endure for centuries. Just as in the Old Sith Wars, the Republic assembled a mighty fleet, mainly provided by Kuat Drive Yards.Kuat, Onara\nleads the Sith against Mandalorians during the First Battle of Malrev IV.]]\nAfter Darth Ruins demise, the first quarter of the New Sith Wars was dominated by the mysterious Dark Underlord, an emotionless revenant who was supported by the Sith faction the Black Knights. The Black Knights and the Underlord ravaged space stations along the Zona Miki route until the Republic counterattacked. The Underlords final confrontation with the Jedi and the Republic came at Malrev IV in approximately 1750 BBY, where Jedi Master Murrtaggh recruited Mandalorian mercenaries to stage a diversionary attack against the forces led by the Underlords Zeltron commander, while he took down the Sith Lord himself. Though successful, the assassination resulted in Murrtagghs fall to the dark side.\nJust over five centuries after Ruins betrayal, in 1500 BBY the Republic had finally managed to build up its armed forces to win victories at Gap Nine,Star Wars Adventure Journal 7 Corphelion and Kings Galquek, halting Sith advances in the Expansion Region and Outer Rim Territories. Despite this, the Sith attracted new allies such as the Devaronians and Hiitians, and in 1466 BBY scored one of their most decisive victories in history, when they crushed the Republic and Jedi forces in the Battle of Mizra. This bloody conflict was later immortalized by the poet Felloux. Over five hundred thousand soldiers died in a single battle and hundreds of Jedi converted to the Dark Side.\nThe terrible defeat caused a crisis in the Republic and a solidification of Sith power, leading to among other things, the tyrannical rise of Darth Rivan of Almas.Living Force Campaign Guide\n\n\u2022 Civilization decays\n\nDespite Rivans eventual defeat at the Battle of Almas, the Republic plunged into turmoil. Mineral mines ran dry, corporations failed, and the Republics borders began to shrink for the first time since the Cold War as colonies were abandoned to the Sith advance and the economic collapse. Law and order suffered as the Jedi found themselves overstretched.\nThe collapse of the HoloNet and interstellar commerce and the general downward spiral of the Galactic Republic continued unabated. Jedi were forced to assume greater leadership, commanding the Republic military, and even becoming Supreme Chancellors, despite the public opinion against them. In 1400 BBY the last non-Jedi ended their service as Supreme Chancellor. For the next four centuries, only Jedi would serve in the post.Darth Bane: Rule of Two An outbreak of Candorian plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of some Republic worlds.\n\n\u2022 The Sictis Wars\n\nSictis Wars\nThe period from 1250 to 1230 BBY was known as the Sictis Wars.The New Essential Guide to Droids In that era, Belia Darzu ruled as Dark Lord of the Sith, unleashing Technobeasts against the Jedi forces from her power base on Tython. The Sictis Wars came to an end with Darzu's death at the hands of the Mecrosa Order, who, though nominally allied with the Sith Empire, poisoned Darzu due to unwanted Sith incursions on Tapani territory.\n\n\u2022 Dark Age\n\nRepublic Dark Age\nAfter nearly a thousand years of war, both sides were in near-collapse&mdash;although the eleventh century BBY would later be described as the \"Republic Dark Age,\" there is little evidence for any coherent Sith threat for much of the period. The Sith, though exponentially increased in number, were divided against one another, as the various warlords and self-proclaimed Dark Lords fought each other for supremacy. The Republic officially branded the war a \"series of protracted military engagements\" against an illegal organization, but in reality the Sith were rampaging across the galaxy virtually unhindered, oppressing entire star systems. Though some new colonies were founded, including Melida/Daan,Jedi Apprentice: The Defenders of the Dead and Tatooine was resettled,Secrets of Tatooine for most of the galaxy it was a dark time.\nThe Republic, for its part, was a pale shadow of what it once was. Much of its former territory was in the hands of independent, self-proclaimed Sith warlords, including Odion and Daiman.Knight Errant 0 These warlords squabbled over the dying embers of the Sith Empire, and while they remained divided, the Republic was given some respite. During this period, the Jedi spent much of their time on the frontier, with only some of their efforts devoted to their traditional duty of maintaining order on Republic worlds. Some Jedi, such as Vannar Treece and his apprentice Kerra Holt would attempt daring raids within Sith-held territory, but for the most part the Republic made no attempt to regain its lost worlds.\nAgainst the Sith threat, other members of the Jedi Order began quests to rout entire systems of Sith influence and purge those whose sought to enslave or exploit the citizens of the Republic. Standing as these systems last line of defense, these individual Jedi became celebrated and quickly came to hold political might. As their constituent worlds came to appreciate their service, these Jedi became barons or kings of entire systems and sectors, taking up the title Jedi Lord.The Essential Guide to Warfare'\nEstablishing castles and manors as their formal residences, these Lords created a formal hereditary system, passing down their titles to their offspring for several generations. The peaceful regions of space stood as islands of light in the darkness created by the Sith, and even Coruscant and the Galactic Senate was presided over by Jedi Supreme Chancellors. During this time, the Jedi High Council competed directly with the Jedi Grand Council which consisted of Lords from across the galaxy.\n\n\u2022 The Sith Civil War\n\nSecond Charge Matrica\nThe Sith saw the crippled Republic as a sign that the Force was with them. However, their plans for a strike against Coruscant were halted after they fell into infighting over who would rule the galaxy after the Republics defeat. An example of such internecine strife was the Charge Matrica' of 1066 BBY in the Grumani sector.\nOwing to such fighting, the threat of the New Sith in the last century of the war was not as great as it might have been, and the Sith civil war would not end until 1010 BBY with the emergence of Lord Skere Kaan and the Brotherhood of Darkness. The Essential Atlas, pp. 134-5\n\n\u2022 The Final Decade\n\n\u2022 The Light and Darkness War\n\nLight and Darkness War\nLuke Skywalker\nWary of the growing power and popularity of the Jedi Lords, the Jedi High Council attempted to groom their own champion against the Sith&mdash;Skere Kaan, born a commoner on Coruscant before being discovered by the Jedi Order and trained in the ways of the Force at the Jedi Temple. Sophisticated and knowledgeable of economic policy and fleet command, Kaan became a Jedi Knight and a beacon for hope among members of the Jedi High Council who hoped to finally destroy the reformed Sith Empire which had been plaguing the Galactic Republic for nearly two centuries.\nHaving perfected the art of battle meditation, Jedi Kaan was considered a valuable asset by the High Council, despite his radical belief that the Republic and the Jedi were responsible for the anarchy which plagued the galaxy. In an effort to moderate Kaan's extremist views, the High Council awarded him the title of Jedi Master. Seeing the High Council as overbearing, Kaan led a group of loyal Knights away from Coruscant and defected to the Sith.\nOut of the ashes of the Sith Empire, Kaan reorganized the Sith into the Brotherhood of Darkness, over 20,000 strong. In an attempt to end the internecine feuds that had torn their Empire apart, Kaan ended the tradition of a sole Dark Lord of the Sith, and recognized each and every claim to the title by the rival warlords. Kaan forged his alliance with the creed of \"Rule by the Strong\" and \"All are equal in the Brotherhood of Darkness.\" He made his headquarters on the planet Roon.\nBeginning in around 1010 BBY, this new group launched a series of attacks designed to destroy the Jedi and the Republic. Kaan, along with the two strongest of the former warlords, Qordis and Kopecz, began their campaign with a daring and symbolic assault on the ancient Sith homeworld of Korriban, which at that time was still under nominal Republic control. The successful capture of that world sealed their alliance, and enabled the reopening of the ancient Sith academy under Qordis' leadership.\nAs Qordis trained new recruits, Kaan and Kopecz continued their war, seizing worlds like Kashyyyk, and even briefly Corulag, Chandrila and Brentaal IV. By 1001 BBY, they seemed almost poised to conquer Coruscant, pressing the Republic on many fronts with the assistance of allies such as the turncoat Jedi King Lahzar, who battled the Republic in the Tholatin system and a colony of Chiss on Thule, abducted from the Unknown Regions by agents of Kaan.\nHowever, Lord Hoth, a Jedi Master and Republic General, had been scoring victories of his own against the Sith. Driving the Brotherhood from their home in the heavily-defended region of space known as the Cloak of the Sith, Hoth chased them from world to world, from Hoth to Dromund Kaas to Malrev IV. In many of his earlier campaigns, he commanded Republic fleets and armies, but around 1002 BBY, he forged the bulk of the Jedi Order's fighting strength into an independent military force known as the Army of Light.\n\n\u2022 The end of the Sith\n\nRuusan campaign\nDark Forces: Jedi Knight\nValenthyne Farfalla at the Seventh Battle of Ruusan]]\nThe war ended with the armies of Hoth and Kaan facing each other on the world of Ruusan. Lord Hoths army of was made of seven Legions of Light, each led by a Jedi Lord, including Valenthyne Farfalla, Gale, Saleeh Teepo, Berethon and Newar Forrth. Under the Jedi Lords served Jedi Generals such as Kiel Charny. Kaans Brotherhood was led by himself, Qordis, Kopecz and less familiar Dark Lords such as Seviss Vaa, LaTor and Githany.\nThe Army of the Light and the Brotherhood of Darkness clashed seven times on the world, each battle causing terrible casualties as Sith and Jedi died in the thousands. Throughout the course of the battles, additional reinforcements attempted to land on Ruusan, though many Jedi forces were destroyed by an orbiting Sith blockade and many Sith reinforcements were destroyed by the Republic Navy en route to Ruusan.\nThough four of the seven battles were won by the Army of Light, their casualties were still enormous and the campaign would later be considered to be the most deadly clash between Jedi and Sith in galactic history. So many Jedi died that Hoth was forced to enlist younger and younger Force-sensitive recruits, and Jedi scouts such as Torr Snapit began to bring pre-adolescents to the battlefield. Though Hoth and his advisors found this distasteful, they reluctantly agreed to accept the child recruits, reasoning that it was better for them to be found by the Jedi than by Kaan's Sith.\nDissension was rife in both camps - for the Jedi, Hoth feuded with his fellow Lord Valenthyne Farfalla, a rift which only deepened with the death of Pernicar, a Jedi Master who had mediated between the two Lords. Even when Farfalla arrived with over three hundred fresh knights as reinforcements, having both defeated the traitorous King Lahzar and broken the Sith blockade over Ruusan, Hoth still refused to speak to him.\nThe Jedi were further undermined when a new recruit, Darovit turned traitor, murdering General Charny and defecting to the Sith.\nAmong the Sith, Kaans leadership began to be questioned by both Githany and Kopecz, and Kaans bungled attempt to remove his rival Darth Bane only served to make him seem foolish, especially after Bane defeated Qordis, Kaans strongest supporter. Bane mocked Kaans reliance on traditional weapons of war, and goaded the Sith leader into using the dark side of the Force to destroy Hoth and the Jedi. With Banes help, Kaan and the other Dark Lords devastated the unprepared Jedi with a Force Storm that ravaged Ruusans surface.\nFortune began to favor the Jedi, though, as the the timely intervention of Farfallas envoy and the assistance of Darth Bane (Banes assistance was unknown to the Jedi), and Hoth's own vision of the dead Pernicar, the two Jedi leaders reconciled, pooling their forces just in time to counteract a renewed Sith surge, leading to the Jedi gaining the upper-hand and the Sith losing numbers and subsequently being forced to retreat.\nFinally, with both armies nearly destroyed, the Sith in near defeat, and the once lush planet totally devastated, the seventh and final Battle of Ruusan took place, ending with Kaans decision to use an ancient Sith technique known as the thought bomb, the instructions secretly provided by Darth Bane in a plot to destroy the other Sith Lords and leave Bane to rebuild the Sith under the \"Rule of Two. Bane had intentionally deceived Kaan into believing that the Brotherhood would survive the thought bomb. Lord Hoth, knowing of his opponents final gambit, took 99 of his most trusted knights with him and confronted Kaan in an attempt to dissuade the Sith Lord from unleashing the weapon. His friend, Tal attempted to dissuade him, having seen disaster through the Force. Lord Farfalla did likewise, but Hoth told both that Kaan had to be stopped.\nHoth and Lord Skere Kaan in the Valley of the Jedi]]\nThe attempt was fruitless, as Kaan's mind had broken during the conflict and the Sith Lord, insanity clouding his vision, was determined to destroy himself and his followers, hoping to annihilate the Army of the Light at the same time.\nAs Kaan unleashed his weapon, both his own army and Hoth's were destroyed in an instant. Those Jedi that survived quickly rallied under Lord Farfalla, and the remaining Sith were easily defeated. Darth Bane, in the meantime, went into hiding with his apprentice, Zannah.\nAfter a thousand years, the New Sith Wars had finally come to an end.\n\n\u2022 Aftermath\n\n\u2022 Reformations\n\nWith the apparent destruction of the Sith, Farfalla, as highest ranking surviving Jedi, used his authority to remove the Jedi from the position of galactic leadership they had acquired during the past centuries, and hand control back to civilian leadership. Tarsus Valorum became the first non-Jedi to serve as Chancellor for six hundred years and, with Farfalla's assistance, Valorum passed far-reaching legislation that restructured both the Republic and the Jedi Order.\n\n\u2022 Setbacks\n\nWhile the New Sith Wars were ultimately over, the scars from the millennial long conflict would plague civilization for centuries. The chaos of the wars had left many once grand civilizations bankrupt and in shambles. The mere collapse of Inter-Galactic civilization set technological development back hundreds of years. Age old advancements in architecture, machinery, and weaponry dating back to the Mandalorian Wars would remain in use for many centuries more.\nThere was to be no full-scale war after the New Sith Wars for almost a thousand years, until the Clone Wars erupted in 22 BBY.I\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\nOrder of the Sith Lords\nDarth Bane\nUnknown to the Jedi and the Republic, one Sith Lord survived: Darth Bane, who had deceived the Brotherhood into destruction. He retreated from the carnage of Ruusan, finding a Force-sensitive child named Rain from among the child recruits of the Army of Light. After the final battle the pair escaped the effects of the thought bomb and made their way, separately, to Onderon.\nBane would accept Rain as his apprentice, dubbing her Darth Zannah, and from her would continue an unbroken line of Sith Lords, culminating in Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, who achieved what the Sith of the past never could: the destruction of the Galactic Republic, and the near annihilation of the Jedi Order.III\n\n\u2022 Timeline of events\n\n\u2022 Fourth Great Schism (c. 2000 BBY)\n\n\u2022 Phanius becomes Darth Ruin.\n\n\u2022 Birth of the new Sith Empire.\n\n\u2022 Early Draggulch Period\n\n\u2022 c.2000 BBY\n\n\u2022 A humanoid race adopts the Bimm culture and is integrated into Bimm society.The Essential Guide to Alien Species\n\n\u2022 c. 1991 BBY\n\n\u2022 Jomark is colonized.Dark Force Rising Sourcebook\n\n\u2022 c. 1960 BBY\n\n\u2022 The Amulet of Kalara is constructed.Legacy of the Force: ExileLegacy of the Force: SacrificeThe Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\n\n\u2022 1989 BBY\n\n\u2022 The planet of Bespin is first colonized.Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide\n\n\u2022 Foamwander City is constructed on Dac.Dark Apprentice\n\n\u2022 1800 BBY\n\n\u2022 Battle of Uba IV\n\n\u2022 c. 1750 BBY\n\n\u2022 Campaign(s) against the Dark Underlord\n\n\u2022 First Battle of Malrev IV\n\n\u2022 c. 1569 BBY\n\n\u2022 The end of the height of Saffa painting.Heir to the Empire\n\n\u2022 Mid Draggulch Period\n\n\u2022 Battle of Kings Galquek\n\n\u2022 Battle of Corphelion\n\n\u2022 Battle of Gap Nine\n\n\u2022 1466 BBY\n\n\u2022 Battle of Mizra\n\n\u2022 1400 BBY\n\n\u2022 By this date, the last non-Jedi Supreme Chancellor had finished their term.\n\n\u2022 before 1250 BBY\n\n\u2022 Battle of Almas\n\n\u2022 1250 BBY\n\n\u2022 The Effulem era, a period of rhythmic poetry and prose, takes place.\n\n\u2022 Sictis Wars begin as Belia Darzu becomes Dark Lord of the Sith.\n\n\u2022 The planet Cularin was forgotten sometime after this date.\n\n\u2022 1230 BBY\n\n\u2022 Sictis Wars end.\n\n\u2022 c. 1196 BBY\n\n\u2022 The civilization on Hathrox III is destroyed in a biochemical civil war.Planet of Twilight\n\n\u2022 1163 BBY\n\n\u2022 Over a millennium from this date, Jedi Master Minos Fel'Kona would determine that the fortress of Darth Rivan on Almas had been built prior to this time.\n\n\u2022 Late Draggulch Period\n\nRepublic Dark Age\n\n\u2022 Republic Dark Age\n\n\u2022 1100 BBY\n\n\u2022 Tatooine is rediscovered by the Galactic Republic.\n\n\u2022 1094 BBY\n\n\u2022 The planet Melida/Daan is colonized no later than this date.\n\n\u2022 First Charge Matrica\n\n\u2022 1066 BBY\n\n\u2022 Vilia Calimondra instigates the Charge Matrica to decide which of her children will be an heir to her holdings.Knight Errant\n\n\u2022 1058 BBY\n\n\u2022 The Mandalorian movement known as the Return begins, as Aga Awaud calls Mandalorians back from across the galaxy to defend their plague-ravaged homeworld.\n\n\u2022 1057 BBY\n\n\u2022 Future Sith Lord Daiman is born to the Sith warlord Xelian.\n\n\u2022 1051 BBY\n\n\u2022 Aga Awaud becomes Mandalore the Uniter.\n\n\u2022 1050 BBY\n\n\u2022 Tarsus Valorum, Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic during the Ruusan Reformations, is born on Coruscant.\n\n\u2022 Kerra Holt is born.Star Wars Insider 116\n\n\u2022 1044 BBY\n\n\u2022 The Sullustan female Tan Tengo was born.Page 53 of the novel Knight Errant mentions that Tan Tengo is a year from reaching the age of thirteen.

Her sector of birth was overrun by the Sith, and she fled as a refugee to the inner areas of the galaxy still controlled by the Galactic Republic.MTV interview In the Republic, she joined the Jedi Order and was trained by the adventurer Vannar Treece.\nKerra determined to make herself into a \"living weapon\" and, having done so, returned to the areas of the galaxy still controlled by the Sith, determined to fight the Sith wherever she found them. The rival Sith Lord brothers Odion and Daiman were two enemies she encountered.\n\n\u2022 Calimondra family\n\nCalimondra family\nVilia Calimondra, a Sith Lord and the matriarch of the family, acquired many husbands, expanding her empire. She mothered seven children, each of whom claimed the right to be Vilias sole heir. In 1066 BBY, Vilia initiated the Charge Matrica, a contest whose winner would be determined by which of Vilias children could expand her empire the greatest. Vilias empire expanded even farther; however, her children eventually went to war with one another. Chagras eventually defeated his rival siblings, but died suddenly in 1040 BBY. Vilia was left with several grandchildren, including Odion and Daiman, each claiming right to her legacy. Vilia initiated a Second Charge Matrica, but, again, Vilias potential heirs descended into war with each other.\n\n\u2022 Hoth\n\nHoth (Jedi Lord)\nLord Hoth led the Army of Light against Skere Kaan's Brotherhood of Darkness during the final decade of the New Sith Wars, until their final confrontation in the Ruusan campaign.\nAided by his friend Pernicar and fellow Jedi Lord Valenthyne Farfalla, Hoth prosecuted the campaign against Kaan, facing challenges of low supplies, dwindling morale, and harsh conditions. Hoth's temper was as legendary as his battle prowess, and after the death of Pernicar a feud between Hoth and Valenthyne Farfalla almost delivered victory to Kaan. Despite their animosity, the pair reconciled, allowing Hoth to face his foe in a final confrontation. Knowing that the desperate Sith would utilize a dangerous Force power known as the thought bomb in an attempt to stave off defeat, Hoth went to face him anyway, forcing the Brotherhood of Darkness to destroy themselves in the process.\nHoth's act of self-sacrifice saved the Republic and ended the Sith as a galactic threat for almost a thousand years.\n\n\u2022 Skere Kaan\n\nSkere Kaan\nA former Jedi Master, Lord Skere Kaan was Dark Lord of the Sith in the last years of the New Sith Wars and ascended to leadership of the Sith Empire almost a decade before the Ruusan campaign, ending a long and protracted civil war among various self proclaimed Sith warlords.\nPreaching a message of Sith unity and equality, Kaan was able to end the Sith civil war that had raged for years, allowing the Sith to refocus on their true enemies, the Jedi.\nAfter uniting the surviving remnants under his banner, Kaan led them into a final war against the Jedi on the world of Ruusan, where he and his opponent, Lord Hoth of the Jedi, fought each other to a standstill. In desperation and hoping to wipe out his opponent, Kaan destroyed destroying himself and his followers with the thought bomb in the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, leaving the Jedi shattered, but ultimately victorious and the Sith presumed extinct.\n\n\u2022 Valenthyne Farfalla\n\nValenthyne Farfalla\nValenthyne Farfalla was a noted Jedi Master and Jedi Lord who fought at Ruusan. A male Half-Bothan, Farfalla had a reputation for being foppish and vain. He aided Lord Hoth and the Army of Light in the Ruusan campaign, in the final years of the Light and Darkness War. In the last year of the battle, Farfalla left Ruusan to gather three hundred Jedi Knights to aid in the struggle for the world.\nFarfalla was often at odds with Hoth, and when the latters good friend Pernicar was killed by the Sith, he blamed Farfalla and the two men had a falling out. However, they eventually repaired their relationship and rallied the Jedi for a final assault on the Sith stronghold. When Hoth and many other Jedi were killed by Lord Skere Kaans thought bomb, Farfalla was left as the highest-ranking Jedi to survive Ruusan.\nFarfalla continued to serve the Jedi for a decade, until he was killed by Darth Bane in a lightsaber battle on Tython.\n\n\u2022 Darth Bane\n\nDarth Bane/Legends\nDarth Bane, born under the name of Dessel, was the Sithari and the Dark Lord of the Sith responsible for creating the Rule of Two.\nRising from humble origins to join Kaan's Sith, he soon lost confidence in the Brotherhood of Darkness, believing Kaan to be a coward and a fool. Deserting the order, he provided Kaan with the secret of the thought bomb, thereby helping to destroy the Brotherhood, allowing him to create his own Sith Order. As the only survivor of the Ruusan campaign, Bane then instituted a Rule of Two, which stated that there could be only two Sith to avoid the infighting that had plagued the Sith for millennia. He styled himself as Darth Bane, and took as his apprentice a Human female, whom he christened Darth Zannah. Zannah would eventually kill her master, taking his place as Sith Lord, but continuing his legacy.\nNearly a millennium later, Bane's Sith Order would defeat the Jedi and overthrow the Republic.\n\n\u2022 Combatants\n\n\u2022 Galactic Republic and Jedi Order\n\nduring the Ruusan campaign]]\nWhen the Draggulch Period began, the Republic had been experiencing peace and prosperity for generations. With Darth Ruin's defection, however, it began to enter a period of decline and by the last century of the New Sith Wars had effectively collapsed, with the era being labeled a \"Dark Age\" by later historians.\nThe Jedi were tied to the Republic and, though they managed to avoid total collapse, were dragged down with the government they served. The collapse in confidence and strength in the Republic was so total after the Battle of Mizra that the Jedi were forced to assume complete control of the remnants of the government apparatus, serving as Chancellors for an unprecedented four centuries. Long after the war, while post-Ruusan historians and imperial propagandists emphasized the anarchy of those centuries, the also marked the period as the last great age of the Jedi Knights. Despite the widespread turmoil, many systems prospered under their rule.\nArmy of Light/Legends\nDuring the Light and Darkness War the Jedi Lord Hoth assumed complete control of the entire Republic military and succeeded in denting Kaans advance. Kaan and Hoth faced off on Ruusan where both were destroyed by Kaans use of the thought bomb. Valenthyne Farfalla took control of the surviving Jedi and declared victory, with the Sith assumed defeated. Farfalla helped Tarsus Valorum rise to the rank of Supreme Chancellor, the first non Jedi in that post for centuries, and together the pair enacted the Ruusan Reformations, marking the end of the Draggulch Period.\n\n\u2022 Sith Order\n\n]]\nThough Darth Ruin only initially attracted fifty fellow Jedi to his heresy, the new Sith Order quickly grew in the ensuing centuries, and were soon able to challenge the Republic on their own terms. Though Ruin was killed, his followers continued the war and a subsequent Dark Lord, the Dark Underlord, was able to consolidate these gains, terrorizing the galaxy with his followers, known as the Black Knights.\nAfter Mizra, the Republic existed in little more than name only, and the Jedi were the true rivals to the Sith, organizing the resistance to the reign of Darth Rivan and Belia Darzu. During the Dark Age, the Sith holdings collapsed into rival, squabbling fiefs, constantly warring against each other, and a unified Sith threat did not exist until Kaan reunited the remnants into the Brotherhood of Darkness.\nBrotherhood of Darkness/Legends\nKaan and his Brotherhood would achieve early success against the weakened Republic, and at one point were close to overwhelming the Core. The rise of the Jedi Lord Hoth to leadership of Republic and Jedi forces would change things, however, and the Jedi quickly took the initiative. Kaan and Hoth faced each other on Ruusan in seven titanic battles until Kaan made the fateful decision to utilize the thought bomb. The Sith were completely wiped out, though the Jedi survived thanks to Lord Hoth's self sacrifice. Only Darth Bane survived the apocalypse and he slipped into hiding, establishing a new, hidden order of Sith that would remain hidden from the Jedi for a thousand years.\n\n\u2022 Other groups\n\nThough the Jedi and Sith dominated the Draggulch Period, other groups were involved in the conflict, and often switched their support from one side or another, depending on the flow of the conflict.\nMandalorian shock troopers participated in the New Sith Wars, lending their talents the highest bidder without regard for justice, morals, or honor. Mandalorian mercenaries hired by Master Murrtaggh assisted the Jedi in defeating the Dark Underlord's Black Knights. However, serving no cause but their own, they would also fight for the Sith in their struggle against the Jedi.\nThe GenDai bounty hunter Durge was in the employ of the Sith approximately a thousand years before the Battle of Naboo. He fought many Jedi, learning their techniques, and developping tactics and equipment to counter them. After the defeat of the Sith, Durge went into hiding, taking on many aliases to avoid Jedi reprisal.Durge\nThe Ubese became set against Jedi after the disastrous Republic intervention on Uba IV that destroyed the Ubese homeworld.\nDuring the Republic Dark Age the shattered factions of the Sith Empire intruded upon Hutt Space, occupying the region. However, the subsequent infighting allowed the Hutts to move their goods and forces in place until the Sith either worked with them or were mercilessly destroyed. One such Hutt, Zodoh, began to intrude upon Sith controlled space of the Bactranate, starting with Aquilaris, as he attempted to expand his business ventures. Without their Sith masters, the Hutt forces easily managed to overpower the Sith troops and began to deploy their atmospheric Stormdriver.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe development of the New Sith Wars' backstory is perhaps one of the more convoluted productions of the Expanded Universe.\nThe first glimmer of what would become the war appeared in the video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, which featured the Valley of the Jedi as the location for a vague ancient battle between Jedi and Dark Jedi. Dark Forces: Rebel Agent and Dark Forces: Jedi Knight, novellas that retold the events of Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, extrapolated from the game, mainly introducing the Jedi Army of Light and its commander, Lord Hoth, and the Dark Jedi Brotherhood of Darkness, under Lord Skere Kaan, as well as the thought bomb, several ancillary characters, and a setting for the battle as having been fought \"centuries ago.\" In neither source was the Brotherhood stated as being Sith; instead, it was variously referred to as Dark Jedi, or just Jedi.Dark Forces: Rebel Agent\nAt around the time Jedi Knight was published, George Lucas was developing a backstory of the Jedi and Sith for the prequel trilogy of films. His version, much of which appeared as exposition in The Phantom Menace novelization, states that the Sith were a formed from a Jedi Knight who broke away from the order and was corrupted by the dark side, two thousand years before the movies. Later the Sith massacred each other for power, leaving a Sith called Darth Bane as the sole survivor who developed the rule of two. In the film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace this backstory is alluded to by Ki-Adi-Mundis comment that the Sith have been extinct \"for a millennium\" and Mace Windu and Yodas comments about the Rule of Two during the final scenes of the film.\nIn the Expanded Universe material the first connection between the two events (the Jedi Knight backstory and Lucas Episode I backstory) came a year after Episode I release, in The Essential Chronology. The Essential Chronology established that the founder of the Sith was merely the founder of a new sect of Sith, the New Sith (in order to mesh with the established Expanded Universe). It slightly altered the timeline of Lucass outline&mdash;following the Sith civil war, Kaan (now established as one of the few surviving Sith Lords) created the Brotherhood of Darkness (now established as a collection of Sith), with the Army of Light being hastily formed to deal with the new threat. Darth Bane was then established as the lone survivor of the Brotherhoods defeat at Ruusan.The Essential Chronology\nA year after The Essential Chronology came out, the comic Star Wars: Jedi vs. Sith was published. It showed the final battles of Ruusan, taking information from all three sources. Notably, it established Bane as being one of Kaans followers and rivals, further tying the two original views together. The vague references to the war in this work were great expanded in the subsequent New Essential Chronology and The Essential Atlas, by authors Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry. Later, Fry collaborated with Paul R. Urquhart on The Essential Guide to Warfare' which revealed more details about the conflict, including the origin and identity of many of the \"Jedi Lords.\"\nAfter in Attack of the Clones it was stated that the Republic been only one thousand years old, the HoloNet News website created the Ruusan Reformation, stating that the Republic reset its measurements and reformed its government in totality following the end of the war on Ruusan. The Ruusan campaign and its immediate aftermath, as well as the character of Darth Bane, were built upon by author Drew Karpyshyn in his novel Darth Bane: Path of Destruction and its two sequels, Darth Bane: Rule of Two and Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil. The period prior to this, the Republic Dark Age, was featured in the ongoing comic series Knight Errant by John Jackson Miller. Miller himself compared the situation in the Republic Dark Age to Britain during the decline of the Roman Empire. The Knight Errant comic series was set during the last decades of the Republic Dark Age, focusing on the point-of-view of a young Jedi Knight named Kerra Holt. The comic series along with a related stand-alone novel by the same author also explored the intricate political and family dynamics of the various Sith warlords in the Grumani sector. The second arc in the comic series Star Wars: Knight Errant: Deluge introduced the concept of a Hutt crimelord as a archetype stock villain while exploring less ethical aspects of the Galactic Republics role in the conflict, particularly the roles of Grace Command and Operation Deluge.Star Wars: Knight Errant: Deluge'\nOf lesser importance are the revelations that the New Sith Wars were responsible for the previously-established destruction of the Ubese homeworld, and the construction of the Sith temple on Malrev IV. In addition, as with most major Star Wars events, a number of lesser events and personalities of the New Sith Wars have been covered by a variety of sourcebooks and articles. Notably, Abel G. Pe\u00f1a has written many of the latter.\nAs opposed to the thousand-year war against the Jedi depicted in Expanded Universe materials, Lucas makes it clear, there was never a Jedi-Sith war, and that the Sith destroyed themselves, not the Jedi.The Star Wars Archives: Episodes I\u2013III, 1999\u20132005 \"Oh, well, there was a war between the Jedi and the Sith. Well, that never happened. Thats just made up by fans or somebody. What really happened is, the Sith ruled the universe for a while, 2,000 years ago. Each Sith has an apprentice, but the problem was, each Sith Lord got to be powerful. And the Sith Lords would try to kill each other because they all wanted to be the most powerful. So in the end they killed each other off, and there wasnt anything left.\" Darth Bane emerged as the sole survivor, and developed the rule of two. \"There cant be any more because they kill each other.\" Lucas explains \"Theyre not smart enough to realize that if they do that, theyre going to wipe themselves out. Which is exactly what they did.\"\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nDark Forces: Jedi Knight audio drama]]\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Three]]\n\u2022 Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Beware the Sith\n\n\u2022 The Essential Guide to Warfare\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded\n\n\u2022 The Essential Reader's Companion\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Suns of Fortune\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Strongholds of Resistance\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\nImageSize=width:640 height:225\nPlotArea=left:10 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nDateFormat=yyyy\nPeriod=from:-2000 till:-750\nTimeAxis=orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nPlotData=\nfontsize:S\nbar:bar1 from:-2000 till:-1250 color: skyblue\nbar:bar1 from:-1250 till:-1230 color: red\nbar:bar1 from:-1230 till:-1100 color: skyblue\nbar:bar1 from:-1100 till:-1010 color: yellowgreen\nbar:bar1 from:-1010 till:-1000 color: orange\nbar:bar1 from:-1000 till:end color: white\nat:start text:\"c. 2000 BBY\" shift: (3,30)\nat:start text:\"Fourth Great Schism\" shift: (3,15)\nat:-1750 text:\"c. 1750 BBY\" align:left shift: (3,45)\nat:-1750 text:\"Campaign(s) against\" shift: (3,30)\nat:-1750 text:\"the Dark Underlord\" shift: (3,15)\nat:-1532 text:\"1532 BBY\" align:right shift: (-1,-25)\nat:-1532 text:\"Battle of Gap Nine\" align:right shift: (-1,-40)\nat:-1466 text:\"1466 BBY\" shift: (3,-25)\nat:-1466 text:\"Battle of Mizra\" shift: (3,-40)\nat:-1250 text:\"\nalign=\"center\"\n-\nStark Hyperspace War]]",

However, Tarkona also planned on using bioterrorism to attack Humans once she learned of and secured the Emperors plague storehouse. A colony on Gammalin was destroyed by one such plague, but Jedi Master Luke Skywalker intervened, while Tarkona herself perished after being infected by a Twilek-specific disease. In the wake of the collapse of the Diversity Alliance, the Cooperative Council of Independent Planetary Governments was formed to promote cooperation between the species of the New Republic.\n\n\u2022 Origins\n\nYoung Jedi Knights: Jedi Bounty\nThe Diversity Alliance was formed as a result of the injustices inflicted on non-Human species by the Humanocentric Galactic Empires New Order.Young Jedi Knights: Delusions of GrandeurThe Essential Chronology' A forerunner to the Diversity Alliance was the Alien Combine, which was formed in 3 ABY, but unwilling to take drastic actions such as terrorism. The Combine was wiped out by the Empire.\nAmong the founders of the Diversity Alliance was Nolaa Tarkona, a Twilek from Ryloth. The Empire had enslaved numerous Twileks; her half-sister Oola had been sold as a slave to the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure and was killed when he fed her to his pet rancor.Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance Not wanting to suffer the same fate as her sister, an enslaved Nolaa rose up against her masters and started a rebellion, with the result that she overthrew the Ryloth government and became the first female Twilek leader in galactic history. Any Twilek that didnt follow Nolaas ideals were killed, exiled, or sent to work in the ryll mines.Young Jedi Knights:Jedi Bounty'\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Rise of the Diversity Alliance\n\nYoung Jedi Knights: Delusions of Grandeur\n, the charismatic leader of the Diversity Alliance.]]\nSoon afterwards, Nolaa started the Diversity Alliance (using Ryloths ryll profits to finance herself) and spread her message of alien unity to many species across the galaxy. She held many rallies on several alien worlds where she whipped up support for the Alliance.The New Essential Chronology' Many aliens joined her including Wookiees, Quarren, Ugnaughts, Trandoshans, Duros, and Chironians. From the outside, the Diversity Alliance seemed like a peaceful aliens-first movement, but it was actually a violent anti-Human terrorist organization.\nTheir activities ranged from coming to the aid of aliens, rescuing alien slaves, sabotage, piracy, overthrowing Human or pro-Human governments on predominantly alien worlds, and propagating their message to aliens. Their supporters included several leading alien politicians in the New Republic Senate, several local-level alien governments, the splinter United Council of Bith Musicians, which promised to play pro-Diversity Alliance and anti-Human songs while touring, and a sub-hive of the insectoid Bartokks. Despite their anti-Human message, Nolaa made use of the services of a few Human bounty hunters like Ailyn Vel - disguised as her infamous father Boba Fett - and Dengar, though she regarded them with suspicion.\n\n\u2022 The Emperor's Plague\n\nNolaa Tarkona\nIn 24 ABY, an alien scavenger named Fonterrat discovered the Emperor's plague storehouse in the Deep Core.

As he had gained support from now-Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, C'baoth played an instrumental role in convincing the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Republic Senate]] to authorize and [[Currency/Legends|fund]] what became known as \"[[Outbound Flight Project]].\" During its development, the whole project was maintained in secrecy, never being shown to the public.<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising\" /> Since the planned expedition would go through the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] of the galaxy, it was decided that its crew members would bring their families so they could colonize hospitable worlds on the way. Although the Republic had its official policy regarding the mission of ''Outbound Flight'', C'baoth had his own plans for the project, envisioning it as being the catalyst for the discovery of other Force-sensitive species who could join the Jedi.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nHowever, as time passed, the enthusiasm of the [[Politics/Legends|political]] class about C'baoth's brainchild began to weaken. It soon became apparent that the ''Outbound Flight'' project was in jeopardy of being sidelined by the Republic's bureaucracy when the [[Financial Appropriations Committee]] of the Senate imposed a series of budget cuts. Furthermore, the Jedi Order also started to step back from the project. While [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] had agreed to assign several Jedi to the project, at the end of the day he was thinking of allowing only one or two.

At the office, Palpatine and Doriana attempted to dismiss the truth behind C'baoth's visit, which failed, however, shortly after C'baoth completely dismissed Doriana, the Jedi Master and Palpatine engaged in a conversation regarding ''Outbound Flight''. As the project's budget had been cut, and the support had decreased, C'baoth requested that it had to come back. Upon Palpatine rejecting it constantly, stating that \"he could not make it happen without the senate's approval,\" Doriana stated that there was something that C'baoth could do to get his funding back, solving a dispute between the [[Corporate Alliance/Legends|Corporate Alliance]] and the [[Brolf]] people, which had been caused by the Corporate Alliance wishing to extract minerals from Brolf. C'baoth accepted to resolve the conflict if ''Outbound Flight'' got its funding back, and [[Mission to Barlok|departed]] for Barlok.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nAt Barlok, Jinzler and C'baoth met with Jedi Knight [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and Jedi Padawan [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], who admired C'baoth, and in turn, impressed C'baoth with his progress. Kenobi and his Padawan had been sent by Jedi Master [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]], the [[Master of the Order/Legends|leader]] of the Jedi Council to spy on C'baoth as the Council was suspicious of the leader of ''Outbound Flight''{{'s}} activities. Wishing to become separated from the rest, C'baoth left Jinzler with the observers while he met with Brolf [[Guild Master/Legends|Guildmaster]] [[Gilfrome]] of the [[Mining Guild/Legends|Mining Guild]] and the Corporate Alliance's leader, [[Koorivar/Legends|Koorivar]] [[Passel Argente/Legends|Passel Argente]] in an attempt to mediate the conflict. While Kenobi's party investigated a plot to kill Argente and all involved with the conflict developed by a Human known as \"Defender,\" who was in fact, Kinman Doriana serving Palpatine's Sith identity of Darth Sidious, C'baoth mediated the conflict.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nEventually, Jinzler uncovered the plot, and was captured by Brolf conspirators. However, Kenobi and Skywalker freed her, uncovering a [[Missile/Legends|missile]] that was set to destroy all at the meeting between the Corporate Alliance and the Mining Guild. The party traveled to where the meeting was being held, although they attempted to stop the missile, the missile continued its path, eventually reaching the meeting room. To Kenobi's surprise, however, C'baoth used his mastery of [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]] to stop the incoming missile, while he addressed the conflict's participants and told them that the Corporate Alliance would be allowed to [[Mining/Legends|extract]] the minerals from Barlok, destroying the missile shortly after with the Force.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\n===''Outbound Flight'' flies===\n{{Quote|It's quite impressive.''\"<br />\"''It's more than just impressive.

The Jedi Master, though, did not suspect that Palpatine would also be the one to secretly sabotage the project. Darth Sidious, the Chancellor's Sith persona, had C'baoth [[Cloning/Legends|cloned]] in the disguise of a [[Blood/Legends|blood]] test shortly before the launch of the Outbound Flight project, covering it as a test for hive [[virus]]es. Sidious also sent his minion, Doriana, ahead of the ''Outbound Flight'' along with [[Special Task Force One]], consisting of two fully armed [[Lucrehulk-class battleship/Legends|''Lucrehulk''-class battleships]] to destroy C'baoth's project, thus effectively killing several dozen Jedi as well as C'baoth himself. As planned, C'baoth was one of the six Jedi Masters aboard the project when it departed from [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]] in [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]]. Once the ''Outbound Flight'' was launched, C'baoth increasingly took control over all of the ship's aspects, even going so far as to take Force-sensitive children away from their parents in the middle of the night to be trained as Jedi. By establishing himself as the ''de facto'' leader over all aspects of the ship, even overruling the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] captain of the vessels, Captain [[Pakmillu]], he earned the resentment of the colonists and crew who had initially joined the ''Outbound Flight'' to seek a better life. Although several Jedi aboard the vessel, including Kenobi, Jedi Master [[Justyn Ma'Ning]], and others warned C'baoth about his rise in power and him doing what they considered wrong, C'baoth continued with his agenda to create more Jedi.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\nAfter Skywalker and Kenobi left ''Outbound Flight'' at the planet of [[Roxuli/Legends|Roxuli]] following Palpatine's request to do so, the ''Outbound Flight'' and all its passengers entered the Unknown Regions.

The Chiss told C'baoth to remove his vessel from [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss space]], to which C'baoth did not comply. Although the passengers of the starship wished to remove C'baoth's tyranny from the vessel, C'baoth used the Force to silence all of them, including their leader, [[Chas Uliar]]. He then ordered Jinzler to get all of them in the storage core following Thrawn's departure.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\n===Death===\n{{Quote|No!

Seeing his efforts as a failure, Thrawn ordered his forces&mdash;[[Vulture-class starfighter/Legends|droid starfighters]] or vulture droids&mdash;to launch an attack on the [[Vagaari slaver fleet|incoming alien forces]], who had been brought at the ''Outbound Flight''{{'s}} position by Human [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Jorj Car'das]]. The two hundred alien vessels, [[Vagaari/Legends|Vagaari]] [[Warship/Legends|warships]] and civilian transports' crews were killed after all Jedi aboard ''Outbound Flight'' performed a [[Force-meld|Force meld]] led by C'baoth. Leaving all Jedi [[Disturbance in the Force/Legends|paralyzed]] by the wave of death caused by the Vagaari, the Jedi aboard were unable to defend themselves from the incoming droid starfighters. However, as the ''Outbound Flight'' was crippled, C'baoth gave into his anger and began turning to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|Dark side of the Force]].

However, C'baoth considered his teachings as a way to make his apprentice ambitious, and to reach beyond their limits, stating it worked as Skywalker was a powerful Padawan already.

A Jedi Consular, Cbaoth chose to focus on diplomacy instead of mastering combat, mediating several conflicts throughout his life. Eventually, Cbaoth became a Jedi Knight and later a Jedi Master, bestowing the later title upon himself after defeating a group of Dark Jedi.\nIn 27 BBY, while training the Human Jedi Lorana Jinzler, Cbaoth managed to secure funding for his brainchild, the Outbound Flight Project&mdash;consisting of a massive starship traveling into the Unknown Regions and beyond while colonizing worlds for the Republic&mdash;by mediating a conflict on the planet Barlok for his friend Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Subsequently, a dozen Jedi and 50,000 people boarded what became Outbound Flight' and traveled across the Republic before entering the Unknown Regions.\nUnbeknownst to them and their master, Cbaoth, Palpatine was secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith known as Darth Sidious, who plotted to destroy Outbound Flight by sending a Trade Federation of Planets task force to destroy the colony starship. However, forces of the Chiss Ascendancy nation intercepted the Federation forces, agreeing to help destroy Outbound Flight to prevent the ship from entering the Ascendancys territory. Refusing to return to the Republic, Cbaoth choked the Chiss commander, Mitthrawnuruodo, while fighting the Vagaari slaver fleet. Using the Trade Federation droid forces, Mitthrawnuruodo bombarded Outbound Flight, destroying it while killing Cbaoth.\n\n\u2022 Biography\n\n\u2022 Early life\n\nDark Force Rising'\nJorus Cbaoth, a Human male was born on the Outer Rim Territories planet of Bortras, specifically on its capital, Reithcas in the last century of the Galactic Republic. From the time of his birth,Joruus CBaoth in 70 BBY, it was evident that the young infant had proficiency in the Force, a mysterious energy field that bound the galaxy together.A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded Eventually, his untrained potential drew the attention of the Order of force wielders of the Jedi Order. Following Jedi tradition,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (novel) Cbaoth was claimed from his birth parents and brought to the Jedi Temple on the ecumenopolis of Coruscant, the capital of the Republic and headquarters of the Jedi. In the Temple, Cbaoth joined the other Jedi Initiates, and the members of the Order became his only family.\nIn 53 BBY, Cbaoth, now seventeen, joined his Jedi studies with an education from a university known as the Mirnic University. Upon his graduation, he traveled to the Kamparas Jedi Training Center on the Core Worlds planet of Kamparas, home to several Jedi sholars.Bear Clan Cbaoth joined to continue his instruction in the demanding ways of the Force. After training at the Jedi Training Center for two years, C'baoth was taken on as a private student.\n\n\u2022 Knighthood\n\nGalactic Senate records on Jorus C'baoth\nIn 44 BBY, Cbaoth joined the ranks of the Jedi Knights, which did what they considered was right. The now-Jedi Knight decided to follow the path of the Jedi Consulars, which chose to master the art of diplomacy instead of combat.Both Dark Force Rising and the Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook mentioned that Cbaoth served as Jedi Adviser to Palpatine. In The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, it was established that Jedi Advisors followed the teachings of the Jedi Consulars. Becoming a supporter of the Galactic Republic, Cbaoth served it in several ways, most notably as mediator and negotiator for many of the galaxys Speciesism-charged conflicts. He notably served as part of the Demilitarization Observation Group stationed on the Mid Rim mineral-rich planet of Ando, where the native Aqualish subspecies endlessly fought with each other over mineral rights. A primary observer within the group, the Jedi from Bortras encountered another member of the task force, the ambitious Senator Palpatine of the Chommell sector. The two diplomats got along, and when they returned to Coruscant, established a long-standing friendship that helped the development of Cbaoths diplomatic career.Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook\nA few years after the events on Ando, the Council of Reassignment appointed Jorus Cbaoth as Palpatines adviser on Jedi-related matters. During his time as a member of the senators staff, the Jedi discussed the Extragalactic Society, a community of scientists devoted to the search for life outside the galaxy. The two friends shared a mutual interest in ExGals ambitious project. However, some years before the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, Cbaoth received visions of the dark side of the Force becoming stronger. The Jedi left the senators staff and was reassigned once again, searching for the source of his premonitions. His search eventually led him to the Elrood sector, in the Outer Rim. There, Cbaoth discovered a group of marauding Dark Jedi who brought chaos to the sector. With the help of a small strike team of fellow Knights, Cbaoth eliminated the dark Force-users. Unbeknownst to him, his old friend Palpatine himself was a powerful darksider, a Dark Lord of the Sith known as Darth Sidious, who was making the dark side stronger with his plots.Darth Plagueis\n\n\u2022 Mastery\n\nJedi Masters Jorus Cbaoth and Obi-Wan Kenobi\nImmediately after his victory against the Dark Jedi, Cbaoth bestowed the title of Jedi Master upon himself, which was unorthodox as usually, the Jedi High Council granted the title to Jedi who had trained several Jedi to Knighthood. However, the Council was pleased with the results of Cbaoth's efforts on the uprising, and accepted his self-imposed promotion, referring to it as well-earned and valid.\n, one of Cbaoths Padawan.]]\nIn 33 BBY, Master Cbaoth got involved in the Esseles droid starfighters affair, due to his relationship with Palpatine, who had become an influential senator. The Jedi Council had received an anonymous datacard, alerting of a factory named Trinkatta Starships that had started building fifty experimental droid starfighters. Worried that these new ships were commissioned by an ally of the Republic plotting a civil war, the Councilmen sent Jedi Master Adi Gallia to ascertain the identity of the one who paid for the starfighters. Master Jorus Cbaoth was summoned by the Council, which asked him not to notify Palpatine or any other Senators of Galias secret mission until they had solid evidence identifying the buyer.1 As Cbaoths diplomatic career continued, he became a member of the Senate Interspecies Advisory Committee, being appointed ambassador of the Xappyh sector, and helped fellow Jedi Master Tras Mins mediate the Duinuogwuin\u2013Gotal conflict. In 32 BBY, Cbaoth was made Jedi Watchman of the Alderaan sector, and was involved in the mediation of a crisis known as the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention. The Ascendancy consisted of tensions between the Organa and Antilles houses as each family wished to succeed in the position of Viceroy. With the assistance of Captain Pello Scrambas of Organa, Cbaoth joined both families in marriage, resolving the tensions.Scrambas, Pello During the Naboo crisis, in the same year, Palpatine was nominated as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. However, although Palpatine and Cbaoth had a long friendship, Cbaoth supported another candidate, Bail Antilles. The Jedi Watchman was seen in the company of the Alderaanian senator during a gathering on the Perlemian Orbital Facility, a space station orbiting Coruscant. However, Cbaoth's friend was nominated and succeded the previous chancellor, Finis Valorum.\nDuring his time as a Jedi Master, Cbaoth took on several Padawans. At some point after training them, the Jedi diplomat took a female Human named Lorana Jinzler as his Padawan. Cbaoth's relationship with his good-natured and humble apprentice was unusually tense. His attitude that Jedi were superior to non-Force users disturbed Jinzler, but she was too timid to confront him or say anything to address the issue.\n\n\u2022 Rise and fall of Outbound Flight\n\nGalactic Senate records on Jorus C'baoth\nAround 29 BBY, Cbaoth was inspired by the Extragalactic Societys example, and he conceived the idea of a massive expedition beyond the Galactic Rim, in an attempt to search for life outside the known galaxy. As he had gained support from now-Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Cbaoth played an instrumental role in convincing the Republic Senate to authorize and fund what became known as \"Outbound Flight Project.\" During its development, the whole project was maintained in secrecy, never being shown to the public. Since the planned expedition would go through the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, it was decided that its crew members would bring their families so they could colonize hospitable worlds on the way. Although the Republic had its official policy regarding the mission of Outbound Flight, Cbaoth had his own plans for the project, envisioning it as being the catalyst for the discovery of other Force-sensitive species who could join the Jedi.\nHowever, as time passed, the enthusiasm of the political class about Cbaoths brainchild began to weaken. It soon became apparent that the Outbound Flight project was in jeopardy of being sidelined by the Republics bureaucracy when the Financial Appropriations Committee of the Senate imposed a series of budget cuts. Furthermore, the Jedi Order also started to step back from the project. While Grand Master Yoda had agreed to assign several Jedi to the project, at the end of the day he was thinking of allowing only one or two. However, although the project was in jeopardy, Cbaoth was still fixed on the project coming to life.\n\n\u2022 Gathering funds\n\nSupreme Chancellor Palpatine and Jedi Master Jorus Cbaoth\nAfter Outbound Flight budget had been cut once again, Cbaoth and his Padawan, Lorana Jinzler, traveled to the Supreme Chancellors office, where Cbaoth confronted Kinman Doriana, one of Palpatines aides, and Palpatine himself. At the office, Palpatine and Doriana attempted to dismiss the truth behind Cbaoths visit, which failed, however, shortly after Cbaoth completely dismissed Doriana, the Jedi Master and Palpatine engaged in a conversation regarding Outbound Flight. As the projects budget had been cut, and the support had decreased, Cbaoth requested that it had to come back. Upon Palpatine rejecting it constantly, stating that \"he could not make it happen without the senates approval,\" Doriana stated that there was something that Cbaoth could do to get his funding back, solving a dispute between the Corporate Alliance and the Brolf people, which had been caused by the Corporate Alliance wishing to extract minerals from Brolf. Cbaoth accepted to resolve the conflict if Outbound Flight got its funding back, and departed for Barlok.\nAt Barlok, Jinzler and Cbaoth met with Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker, who admired Cbaoth, and in turn, impressed Cbaoth with his progress. Kenobi and his Padawan had been sent by Jedi Master Mace Windu, the leader of the Jedi Council to spy on Cbaoth as the Council was suspicious of the leader of Outbound Flight activities. Wishing to become separated from the rest, Cbaoth left Jinzler with the observers while he met with Brolf Guildmaster Gilfrome of the Mining Guild and the Corporate Alliances leader, Koorivar Passel Argente in an attempt to mediate the conflict. While Kenobis party investigated a plot to kill Argente and all involved with the conflict developed by a Human known as \"Defender,\" who was in fact, Kinman Doriana serving Palpatines Sith identity of Darth Sidious, Cbaoth mediated the conflict.\nEventually, Jinzler uncovered the plot, and was captured by Brolf conspirators. However, Kenobi and Skywalker freed her, uncovering a missile that was set to destroy all at the meeting between the Corporate Alliance and the Mining Guild. The party traveled to where the meeting was being held, although they attempted to stop the missile, the missile continued its path, eventually reaching the meeting room. To Kenobis surprise, however, Cbaoth used his mastery of telekinesis to stop the incoming missile, while he addressed the conflict's participants and told them that the Corporate Alliance would be allowed to extract the minerals from Barlok, destroying the missile shortly after with the Force.\n\n\u2022 Outbound Flight flies\n\nJorus Cbaoth and Lorana Jinzler upon seeing Outbound Flight'\nAfter the Jedi Master thwarted the assassination attempt on Barlok, Palpatine and the Senate gave Cbaoths Project the support that CBaoth believed it would need, as well as the necessary warships and crew. The Jedi Master, though, did not suspect that Palpatine would also be the one to secretly sabotage the project. Darth Sidious, the Chancellors Sith persona, had Cbaoth cloned in the disguise of a blood test shortly before the launch of the Outbound Flight project, covering it as a test for hive viruses. Sidious also sent his minion, Doriana, ahead of the Outbound Flight along with Special Task Force One, consisting of two fully armed Lucrehulk-class battleships to destroy Cbaoths project, thus effectively killing several dozen Jedi as well as Cbaoth himself. As planned, Cbaoth was one of the six Jedi Masters aboard the project when it departed from Yaga Minor in 27 BBY. Once the Outbound Flight was launched, Cbaoth increasingly took control over all of the ships aspects, even going so far as to take Force-sensitive children away from their parents in the middle of the night to be trained as Jedi. By establishing himself as the de facto leader over all aspects of the ship, even overruling the Mon Calamari captain of the vessels, Captain Pakmillu, he earned the resentment of the colonists and crew who had initially joined the Outbound Flight to seek a better life. Although several Jedi aboard the vessel, including Kenobi, Jedi Master Justyn MaNing, and others warned Cbaoth about his rise in power and him doing what they considered wrong, Cbaoth continued with his agenda to create more Jedi.\nAfter Skywalker and Kenobi left Outbound Flight at the planet of Roxuli following Palpatines request to do so, the Outbound Flight and all its passengers entered the Unknown Regions. Upon the massive starships arrival, it was confronted by Chiss Picket Force Twos commander, Force Commander Mitthrawnuruodo with the Core name of \"Thrawn\", who contacted Cbaoth and met with him aboard Outbound Flight. The Chiss told Cbaoth to remove his vessel from Chiss space, to which Cbaoth did not comply. Although the passengers of the starship wished to remove Cbaoths tyranny from the vessel, Cbaoth used the Force to silence all of them, including their leader, Chas Uliar. He then ordered Jinzler to get all of them in the storage core following Thrawns departure.\n\n\u2022 Death\n\nJedi Knight Lorana Jinzler on her Masters fall to the Dark side\nThe Chiss commander waited an hour, and then, attempted to negotiate with Cbaoth again, being cut off by the Jedi. Seeing his efforts as a failure, Thrawn ordered his forces&mdash;droid starfighters or vulture droids&mdash;to launch an attack on the incoming alien forces, who had been brought at the Outbound Flight position by Human smuggler Jorj Cardas. The two hundred alien vessels, Vagaari warships and civilian transports crews were killed after all Jedi aboard Outbound Flight performed a Force meld led by Cbaoth. Leaving all Jedi paralyzed by the wave of death caused by the Vagaari, the Jedi aboard were unable to defend themselves from the incoming droid starfighters. However, as the Outbound Flight was crippled, Cbaoth gave into his anger and began turning to the Dark side of the Force. His Padawan sensed him falling and attempted to reach him in time to save him, however, the Chiss attack on the vessel made her unable to. The Jedi then opened a comm channel with Thrawn, and choked Thrawn in an attempt to kill him.\nHowever, Doriana, who was aboard the Springhawk, Thrawns flagship, pushed a button that ordered all vulture droids to fire their radiation bombs at Outbound Flight, which killed everyone aboard, including Cbaoth, but the fifty-seven prisoners and Jinzler, who had been sent there by C'baoth.\n\n\u2022 Legacy\n\nHeir to the Empire\nPalpatine had extracted analysis-grade blood and tissue samples, the secretly Dark Lord of the Sith cloned Cbaoth using Spaarti cloning cylinders, which made Jorus Force-sensitive clone, Joruus Cbaoth, go insane.The New Essential Chronology Joruus was found at the planet of Wayland by now-Grand Admiral Thrawn, who used the clone in his decisive campaign against the reborn Jedi Order and the successor of Palpatines Galactic Empire, the New Republic. Using the clones&mdash;and subsequently, Jorus&mdash;Force powers, Joruus became a major player in Thrawn's campaign.\nGiven that the Great Jedi Purge created by Jorus friend, Palpatine, had destroyed most records relating to the Jedi and that Wayland itself was a carefully hidden secret, almost no one knew that Joruus Cbaoth was a clone, except for Thrawn, who had killed the original when destroying Outbound Flight. Due to deteriorating sanity from the unstable Spaarti cloning cylinders as well as long isolation, even Joruus Cbaoth forgot his true origins and believed himself to be the original Master Cbaoth.The Last Command However, the insane Dark Jedi was killed at the hands of Human Mara Jade Skywalker at the clones planet of origin, Wayland, which after Thrawns death, ended the Chiss' campaign.\n\n\u2022 Personality and traits\n\nJedi Master Jorus C'baoth to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine\nA wild-eyed Human with a chiseled face,Cloak of Deception Jorus Cbaoth was a tall man of average build, and was considered fairly muscular. His clone, Joruus, stood at 1.9 meters.Joruus Cbaoth At the time of the Alderaan Ascendency Contention, he had a neatly trimmed short beard. Walking with long loping strides, he simply expected other beings to make room for him, stepping to either side, for he never conceded to other, inferior beings the right of way. Cbaoths manner of speaking was direct, unadorned, no-nonsense. He spoke in a husky baritone voice. Cbaoth was known to believe in the superiority of the Jedi, his unapologetic conviction was that the Jedi were far above the galaxys average non-Force users, and therefore they had the right to rule over them, be they outlaws, thieves, bureaucrats, or senators. His proud attitude of superiority caused several Jedi to be disturbed by his views, including his own Padawan Lorana Jinzler&mdash;to whom he was especially brutal, considering he was her Jedi Master.\nCbaoth was also extremely arrogant in his dealings, not only with non-Force users, but also with his fellow Jedi. That arrogance, as it combined with his often severe attitudes, divided many Jedi on their perception and/or approbation of the Jedi Master. Some believed that he was the consummate model of what it meant to be a Jedi, while others vehemently disagreed with his methods and remained very wary of him and his extremist views. Cbaoth was among the very few Jedi Masters who indulged an unqualified admiration of Anakin Skywalker, and the Padawan's prodigious youth, in turn, Skywalker admired the master, believing him to be a powerful Jedi who he could learn a lot from.\n\n\u2022 Relationships\n\n\u2022 Obi-Wan Kenobi\n\nJedi Master Jorus Cbaoth held a major dislike toward Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, as the latter viewed Cbaoths way of teaching as a path toward the dark side, and constantly suggested that Cbaoth used the dark side. However, Cbaoth considered his teachings as a way to make his apprentice ambitious, and to reach beyond their limits, stating it worked as Skywalker was a powerful Padawan already. During their time together, Kenobi was disturbed by the arrogant Jedi Masters way of speaking and techniques, as well as the use of advanced Jedi techniques, such as the Force meld, which Kenobi considered dangerous.\n\n\u2022 Anakin Skywalker\n\nJedi Master Jorus C'baoth and Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker\nCbaoth admired Skywalker, as the young Padawan had become far more powerful than what a normal Padawan would have achieved, which he constantly reminded his Padawan, Jinzler, of. The admiration went both ways, as Skywalker viewed Cbaoth as a powerful, direct, and knowledgeable Jedi Master, and Skywalker also wished to spend more time with Cbaoth, as he believed he could learn a lot by watching Cbaoth do his daily activities.\n\n\u2022 Lorana Jinzler\n\nJedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Lorana Jinzler\nThe Jedi Master was arrogant and harsh toward Jinzler, as she had not reached the power Skywalker had obtained in a shorter time. However, once she achieved the title of Jedi Knight, Cbaoth was very proud of Jinzler, viewing her as a fully-fleshed-out Jedi. Cbaoth was admired by Jinzler, as he was considered powerful by his Padawan, and a man who had taught her a lot of valuable lessons, both in the Force and in daily life. Both cared for each other, most notably, shortly before Cbaoths death, Jinzler attempted to reach D-One to help C'baoth when he had fallen to the dark side.\n\n\u2022 Palpatine\n\nCbaoth and Palpatine had a long-standing friendship, as Cbaoth respected Palpatine and vice versa. With Palpatines support, Cbaoth was able to eventually launch Outbound Flight, which he was not grateful for, as Palpatine had taken \"too much time\" from the Jedi Master, allowing the bureaucrats and senate to delay the project. However, although both shared a friendship, Palpatine, under his secret Sith identity of Darth Sidious, destroyed Outbound Flight through Thrawn and Doriana, which was \"helpful\" as Palpatine had killed approximately 20 Jedi at once.\n\n\u2022 Powers and abilities\n\nChancellor Palpatine to his young assistant and advisor\nJedi Master Jorus Cbaoth was a very gifted and talented Jedi. As he showed prowess in the Force, he was quickly brought to the Jedi Temple. Cbaoth was proficient in telekinesis, as he showcased during the dispute on Barlok, where he stopped an incoming missile to explode and collide with its targets. The talented Jedi was also able to perform Force-Choke through a simple video transmission, choking someone at lightyears ahead of him, which he used against Thrawn before his death. Another example of his proficiency in the Force was his ability in Force Meld, being able to anchor several Jedi in a row, and not being exhausted afterward, but being unaffected after performing several melds. Among Cbaoths other Force abilities were the common Jedi mind trick, Force stealth, telepathy, battlemind, Force sight, farsight, Force healing, and Force empathy.\nHis skill with the Force eventually culminated in imposing himself on the title of Jedi Master thanks to his prowess in the Force. However, although no one approved his decision, the Jedi High Council and Jedi saw it as a well-deserved promotion. He also was a highly intelligent man, being able to speak fluently in Galactic Basic Standard, expanding on his ability to read and write ancient Onderonian. He could also speak Huttese.\n\n\u2022 Equipment\n\nJorus C'baoth wore a dark brown cloak and light-colored Jedi robes. It\u2019s unknown if he used a lightsaber or not.\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\n\u2022 Creation\n\nTimothy Zahn\nJorus Cbaoth was first mentioned in the 1991 novel Heir to the Empire, the first entry of The Thrawn Trilogy, which was written by Timothy Zahn. While the Jedi Master didnt appear himself in the book, a mad clone of Cbaoth served as one of the novels main antagonists. The original Jorus Cbaoth made his first brief appearance in Episode I Adventures 1: Search for the Lost Jedi, a 1999 novel written by Ryder Windham. After those cameos, Timothy Zahn fleshed out his character in 2006 by writing Outbound Flight, a novel centered on the events surrounding Cbaoth's demise and life.\n\n\u2022 Timeline and continuity issues\n\nGalactic Senate records on Jorus Cbaoth as shown in Dark Force Rising\nThe second installment in the trilogy, Dark Force Rising, included a very thorough biography of Cbaoth, complete with a \"Pre-Empire\" dating system using a month\\day\\year notation. However, Zahns original dating was based on when he believed the Clone Wars took place. At the time, George Lucas had not settled on the final timeline, and Star Wars authors were told that the Clone Wars took place thirty-five years before Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. However, with the release of the prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, it was revealed that the Clone Wars ended only nineteen years before Episode IV. Therefore, all the dates featured in the Thrawn Trilogy were off by at least sixteen years.Heir to the Empire: The 20th Anniversary Edition In 2002, Cbaoths birth date was retconned to 70 BBY in the Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook.\nAccording to The Essential Guide to Characters, Cbaoths last name is pronounced \"Sub-Bay-Eth.\"The Essential Guide to Characters. However, Zahn has stated that it is pronounced \"SA-bay-oth,\" with the first vowel pronounced like the a in has. Timothy Zahn commented that had he realized how hard it would be for everyone else to figure out the pronunciation, he would have changed the spelling. Jorus Cbaoth was originally named as the Jedi who quelled the insurrection of several Bpfasshi Dark Jedi during the Clone Wars. After the exact date of the Clone Wars was revealed, that became impossible, as Cbaoth had died five years earlier. Yoda was then named as the Jedi Master responsible for opposing the insurrectionVision of the Future some time after the end of the war.Scum and Villainy\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\n\u2022 Darth Plagueis Darth Plagueis (audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Cloak of Deception\n\n\u2022 1\n\n\u2022 Outbound Flight Outbound Flight (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 SkyeWalkers: A Clone Wars Story\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Rebellion\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 X-Wing: The Bacta War X-Wing: The Bacta War (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Heir to the Empire Heir to the Empire (unabridged audiobook) in book\n\n\u2022 Dark Force Rising Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Dark Force Rising 1\n\n\u2022 The Last Command The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 Survivor's Quest Survivor's Quest (unabridged audiobook)\n\n\u2022 The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial\n\n\u2022 Crosscurrent\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\nStar Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 29]]\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Joruus C'baoth\n\n\u2022 Scrambas, Pello\n\n\u2022 The Essential Guide to Warfare\n\n\u2022 The Essential Reader's Companion\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",

The full weight\nof the Empire is about to come to bear\nagainst the rebels.\n\nIn their secret headquarters, Alliance\nleaders, resolute after their recent\nvictory, gather the warships of the rebel\nfleet. Although they have won a\nsignificant battle, the war between the\nAlliance and the Empire has only just\nbegun....}}\nThe game started right after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] and the destruction of the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]]. The [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] was ready to strike back against the Rebel base of [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], while the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] was readying to move to another system.\n\nApart from the given time of the beginning, the game was not story driven and the scenario expanded freely. Events of the later movies are mentioned and can happen randomly (like the capture of Han Solo by bounty hunters or the Jedi training of Luke Skywalker).\n\nSome characters were Force sensitive and could be trained by Jedi characters (like Skywalker or Vader) to augment their abilities. This would lead to a powerful team that could turn many missions successful, improve the morale of planets and fleets they were in, etc.\n\n===Canonicity===\nThe game is non-linear and open-ended (the player is able to do anything in any order, according to their own preference and skill); therefore, the player could change or avert some events of the canonical timeline, like not migrating to Hoth after Yavin, creating more than one Death Star, killing off important characters like [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] or [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] and even leading the Empire to victory.\n\nThere were, however, some inconsistencies to the canon, like having to \"discover\" planets and \"recruit\" characters who, according to the timeline, were already known. Gameplay values are also radically changed; many spacecraft have shield values different from their canonical values. The Interdictor cruiser, for example, has twice the shield power of the ''Imperial''-class and the Super Star Destroyer is \"merely\" four times as strong as the ''Imperial''-class.\n\nThe game contains a large number of misspelled location and character names (such as [[Farrfin sector]] spelled as \"Farfin\"). Some bloopers also are present, such as the identity of [[Bob Hudsol/Legends|Bob Hudsol]] (switched with [[Vanden Willard/Legends|Vanden Willard]]) and inaccurate encyclopedia entries, such as the one on the [[Dark Trooper/Legends|Dark troopers]] (suggesting they are [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]). Also, more noticeably, some planets are shown in the wrong sectors. As such, cartographic placements are treated as canon in this article unless they contradict already established locations, in which case the original placement supersedes the ''Rebellion'' placement.\n\nAn additional aspect is the random way that Force-sensitivity is determined. Characters that have no known Force abilities outside of this game, such as Chewbacca or Piett, can randomly be generated as Force-sensitive at the start of a new game and trained up to Jedi Master level.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Rebel_transport.jpg|left|thumb|Scene from the intro]]\nAlthough a [[Wikipedia:Real-time strategy|real-time strategy]] game in the wider sense of the term, it belonged to the [[Wikipedia:4X|4X]] genre (a sub-genre of games often containing galactic conquest like [[Wikipedia:Master of Orion|''Master of Orion'']]), though the action of ''Rebellion'' was more abstract.\n\nThe game interface consisted of a map of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] and an advisor [[Droid/Legends|droid]] (which in the case of the Rebellion, was [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and in the case of the Empire, [[IMP-22]]). The map comprised [[Sector/Legends|sectors]] of 10 systems (the number of sectors was customizable for either 10, 15 or 20), all known from the Star Wars universe. Some of them belonged to 'unknown' regions, and needed to be explored. The sectors on the game map did not correspond to the canon information otherwise available, so it was assumed that the location of various systems was arbitrary for gameplay.\nThe player assumed the role of an officer of either the Rebellion or the Empire. He was called to manage command and maintenance, like colonization, diplomacy, creation of buildings and units, supervising of mines and resources, building and assigning of fleets, conversion of systems to one's own side, recruiting of characters, (60 in the game, both from the movies and the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]]) and dispatching characters or units to [[Star system/Legends|systems]] (up to 200 available) or fleets.\n\nEvery element of the game had its own encyclopedia-like 'card' with a short description and abilities sheet. This amounted to a total of several hundred encyclopedia cards.\n\n===Objectives===\nThe standard objective of each game was to take the headquarters of the enemy ([[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] or the mobile Rebel base) and capture the two leaders of the opposite side: The Alliance had to capture Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, and the Empire's objectives were to capture Luke Skywalker and Mon Mothma.\n\nAnother mode was also available where you only had to find and destroy the enemy's headquarters.\n\n===Faction strengths and weaknesses===\nBoth the Rebels and the Empire have their own strengths and weaknesses, which affect how a player should use them.\n*'''Rebels:''' The primary strength for the Rebels is that, like in the movies, the Empire has to look for their headquarters, and the Rebels can move it to another location. The Rebels start with a larger number of diplomatic, recruiting, and combat characters than the Empire does, so they can start off with missions to move planets to their side or recruiting characters more quickly and at a higher rate than the Empire. The Rebels' main weakness is that, like in the movies, they are outgunned. It isn't until later in the game that they can get ships that can match what the Empire can build, but they compensate somewhat by having much better fighters than Empire for most of the game. Also, the Rebels are unable to do Assassination Missions, since the Rebels are the \"good side.\"\n*'''Empire:''': The Imperial Fleet outguns the Rebellion for most of the game. Part of this is because the Empire starts with the ability to construct [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]], which the Rebels starships can't compete against for most of the game. The Empire also starts with a larger number of skilled generals and admirals (who receive an additional 50% bonus to their Leadership Skill if the [[Palpatine/Legends|Emperor]] resides on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]), giving it an edge in battles, and it can research better ships and troop types more quickly. The Empire's weakness is that, unlike the Rebels, it can't move its headquarters. It's always located on Coruscant and will be the constant target for the Rebels. The Empire also doesn't start with as many recruiting or diplomatic characters as the Rebels do. Also, although the Empire's starships are better for most of the game, their starting fighters are extremely weak.\n\n===Unit management===\nThere were several kinds of buildable units. Each kind could be constructed by one of three construction facilities.\n*Installations were buildings on a planet's surface or in orbit. They could be construction facilities or defense installations.\n*Mines produced raw material from planets, while refineries refined them into processed materials that could be used for construction, and both increased maintenance and thus allowed for larger military forces.\n*Construction Yards built other installations.\n*Troop Training Facilities created troops and special forces.\n*Shipyards constructed starships and fighter squadrons.\n*Planetary cannons attacked assaulting starships and troop transports, and the Ion Cannon is also used to defend units escaping a blockade.\n*Shield generators defended everything on the planet from orbital bombardment.\n*Troops were used to conquer and defend planets, and to claim uninhabited systems.\n*Starships could blockade systems, unleash orbital bombardments, and be the platforms for planetary assault. They could also carry troops and starfighters up to their respective limits and an unlimited number of characters and special forces.\n*Starfighters could be stationed on planets or capital starships, and were built in squadrons. They could fight in fleet battles, and add to bombardment and detection ratings.\n*Special forces included spies, saboteurs, and long-range reconnaissance teams.\nAs research progressed, new units and facilities became available for construction. Research could be sped up significantly by ordering characters with the corresponding ability to conduct design missions. Characters could also have the ability to research facilities, starships or troop designs.\n\nSometime during the game a planet could be hit with a Natural Disaster that would destroy resources and energy on the planet, making it worthless. At the same time, new resources can pop up on a planet.\n\n===Characters and starships===\nThere were two kinds of characters in the game: major and minor ones.\nMajor characters were always available at the beginning of the game, while most minor ones had to be recruited. Only major characters could embark on recruitment missions and could not be killed in the line of duty but could be injured, removing them from play for a while.\n\nMinor characters could sometimes be generated [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-sensitive and could be trained by Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader, to augment their abilities. The main characters with Force control could also enhance their abilities by conducting missions. Characters with higher Force ratings had better abilities in diplomacy, espionage, and combat, and could therefore perform missions with a higher chance of success. Force sensitivity could be a two-edged sword however, as Force-sensitive characters stationed in a system could detect the presence of enemy Force-sensitives trying to perform a mission there, and foil the mission automatically. Princess Leia could become Force-sensitive, but only if Luke Skywalker learns of his heritage (i.e. if he meets Darth Vader in combat and is not captured) and the two meet on a planet or ship somewhere in the galaxy where he reveals that she is his twin sister.\n\nSome characters could be given military ranks by the player to put them in specific roles: an [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] increased a fleet's performance by enhancing firepower, shields and speed; a [[General/Legends|general]] increased the performance of troops and reduced the likelihood of successful enemy missions on a friendly planet; a [[Commander/Legends|commander]] increased the combat efficiency and speed of starfighter squadrons. Ship-based squadrons also launch faster with a commander present.\n\nSome characters can betray your side to the enemy if the winning conditions favor the other side. Traitors can only be detected by Force-sensitive characters, and the only ways to remove a traitor are to either improve your winning conditions or retire the character, where retiring means the character is out of the game entirely.\n\nAll of the Rebel starfighters have shields and hyperdrive, while the [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter/Legends|TIE Defender]] is the only starfighter the Empire has that has shields and hyperdrive, and does not start inside a capital ship.\n\n===Units===\nGround Forces are used to defend your planets from assaults, missions, and stop uprisings, where the latter is often a risky, and not a favored choice among veteran players to control planets. They are also used to assault enemy planets.\n\nSpecial forces units are used to conduct various missions in lieu of characters, except Diplomacy, Recruitment, and Jedi Training. These units are most often used as opposed to characters to conduct missions in dangerous areas if failure is high.\n\n===Facilities===\nThese structures are avaliable to players as long as they have access to at least one Construction Yard. Each structure needs at least one unit of energy (blue), with mines needing one unit of raw materials (red).\n*Advanced Contruction Yard - Builds facilities and planetary defenses at twice the speed of normal construction yards\n*Advanced Shipyard - Builds starships and fighters at twice the speed of normal shipyards\n*Advanced Training Facilities - Builds ground and special forces at twice the speed of normal training facilities\n*Construction Yard - Allows construction of facilities and planetary defenses\n*Death Star Shield (Empire Only) - Prevents the enemy to conduct an attack run on a Death Star in the event of a battle over the planet\n*GenCore Level I Shield Generator - Shields a system from enemy bombardments. Two shield generators stops planetary assaults\n*GenCore Level II - Shields a system from enemy bombardments at twice the strength as the Level I and uses less maintance points. Two shield generators stops planetary assaults\n*KDY-150 Ion Cannon - Allows evacuation of systems under blockade without the threat of being intercepted by enemy ships or fighters\n*LNR Series I Planetary Battery - Fires on bombarding ships in a blockade dealing damage to one target. If a general is on the planet, has a chance to significantly damage higher tiered ships and destroy lower tiered ships\n*LNR Series II Planetary Battery - Fires on bombarding ships in a blockade dealing significant damage than the Series I and can destroy mid-tiered ships. If a general is on the planet, has a chance to destroy any ship, regardless of tier.\n*Mine - Mines raw materials for use of refining. Adds 50 maintance points to the maintance pool if there's a vacant refinery.\n*Orbital Shipyard - Allows construction of starships and starfighters\n*Refinery - Refines raw materials into refined materials used in construction of facilities, troops, and ships. Adds 50 maintance points to the maintance pool if there is a vacant mine.\n*Training Facilities - Allows training of ground and special forces\n\n===Missions===\nAll characters and certain special forces can conduct any mission against the opponent, or assists in your hand. Success on the mission depends on the stats of the character in question. The mission list is as follows:\n*Assassination Mission (Empire Only) - Injure or kill a targeted character\n*Abduction - Captures a target character\n*Espionage - Gathers information on a targeted system's defenses, personal, facilities, fleets in orbit, and ongoing missions, where a successful mission can lead to information from another system. (Rebel players who successfully conduct an espionage mission on Coruscant can obtain information on several enemy-controlled planets)\n*Incite Uprising - Attempts to sway public opinion against your opponent which could lead to the planet going neutral or thrown into a full-blown uprising\n*Sabotage - Destroys a targeted installation, planetary defense structure, regiment, planetary-based starfighters, or any starship in orbit over a planet.\n*Death Star Sabotage (Rebel Only) - Destroys a Death Star over a planet\n*Recruitment - Recruits other characters into your army\n*Facility Design Research - Improves the capabilities of Construction Yards to research and develop new structures\n*Troop Design Research - Improves the capabilities of Training Facilities to research and develop new troop regiments\n*Starship Design Research - Improves the capabilities of Shipyards to research and develop new starships\n*Diplomacy - Sways public opinion to your side in an attempt to either convince them to join your side, or max out public opinion\n*Rescue - Rescues captured characters from your opponent\n*Jedi Training - When present with at least a Jedi Knight or better, trains targeted Force-Sensitive characters to improve stats overall\n*Subdue Uprising - Stops an uprising on a planet you control\n\n===Sectors and planets===\nThe player is given three options for the size of the galaxy, impacting which sectors are in play and potentially the length of the game.\n\nThe smallest galaxy has 10 sectors, with three fully discovered core sectors: Corellian, Sesswenna, and Sluis; and seven unexplored sectors on the outer rim where the initial location of the Rebel base could be randomly generated: Calaron, Churba, Dufilvan, Mayagil, Moddell, Orus, and Sumitra. The medium size adds Farfin to the core and four to the outer rim: Glythe, Jospro, Kanchen, and Quelli. The largest has a total of 20 sectors, adding Dolomar and Fakir to the core and Abrion, Atrivis, and Xappyh to the outer rim.\n\nBatteries and planetary shields protect your planet from opposing fleets. Two shield generators on a planet will prevent the opponent from landing troops where the batteries will open fire on a blockading fleet that is bombarding. The batteries can inflict serious damage on an enemy fleet where one with a General has a strong chance to destroy a capital ship after bombardment, including a Super Star Destroyer.\n\n==Appearances==\nMany of the planet locations in the game are placed in the galaxy map in the wrong places canonically. Those marked in '''bold''' are correct. Those placed incorrectly have their correct locations in parenthesis ( ).\n{{App\n|characters=\n*[[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]]\n*[[Kaiya Adrimetrum]]\n*[[Afyon]]\n*[[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge

    "plain_text": "rwm\nStar Wars: Rebellion\nPC]]\nStar Wars: Rebellion (video game)\nStar Wars: Rebellion (or Star Wars: Supremacy in the United Kingdom) was a LucasArts strategy game released on February 28, 1998.\nIt is unrelated to the 2006 comic book series of the same name.\n\n\u2022 Plot summary\n\n\u2022 Opening crawl\n\nThe game started right after the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the Death Star. The Galactic Empire was ready to strike back against the Rebel base of Yavin 4, while the Rebel Alliance was readying to move to another system.\nApart from the given time of the beginning, the game was not story driven and the scenario expanded freely. Events of the later movies are mentioned and can happen randomly (like the capture of Han Solo by bounty hunters or the Jedi training of Luke Skywalker).\nSome characters were Force sensitive and could be trained by Jedi characters (like Skywalker or Vader) to augment their abilities. This would lead to a powerful team that could turn many missions successful, improve the morale of planets and fleets they were in, etc.\n\n\u2022 Canonicity\n\nThe game is non-linear and open-ended (the player is able to do anything in any order, according to their own preference and skill); therefore, the player could change or avert some events of the canonical timeline, like not migrating to Hoth after Yavin, creating more than one Death Star, killing off important characters like Chewbacca or Lando Calrissian and even leading the Empire to victory.\nThere were, however, some inconsistencies to the canon, like having to \"discover\" planets and \"recruit\" characters who, according to the timeline, were already known. Gameplay values are also radically changed; many spacecraft have shield values different from their canonical values. The Interdictor cruiser, for example, has twice the shield power of the Imperial-class and the Super Star Destroyer is \"merely\" four times as strong as the Imperial-class.\nThe game contains a large number of misspelled location and character names (such as Farrfin sector spelled as \"Farfin\"). Some bloopers also are present, such as the identity of Bob Hudsol (switched with Vanden Willard) and inaccurate encyclopedia entries, such as the one on the Dark troopers (suggesting they are Force-sensitive stormtroopers). Also, more noticeably, some planets are shown in the wrong sectors. As such, cartographic placements are treated as canon in this article unless they contradict already established locations, in which case the original placement supersedes the Rebellion placement.\nAn additional aspect is the random way that Force-sensitivity is determined. Characters that have no known Force abilities outside of this game, such as Chewbacca or Piett, can randomly be generated as Force-sensitive at the start of a new game and trained up to Jedi Master level.\n\n\u2022 Gameplay\n\nAlthough a real-time strategy game in the wider sense of the term, it belonged to the 4X genre (a sub-genre of games often containing galactic conquest like Master of Orion), though the action of Rebellion was more abstract.\nThe game interface consisted of a map of the galaxy and an advisor droid (which in the case of the Rebellion, was C-3PO and in the case of the Empire, IMP-22). The map comprised sectors of 10 systems (the number of sectors was customizable for either 10, 15 or 20), all known from the Star Wars universe. Some of them belonged to unknown regions, and needed to be explored. The sectors on the game map did not correspond to the canon information otherwise available, so it was assumed that the location of various systems was arbitrary for gameplay.\nThe player assumed the role of an officer of either the Rebellion or the Empire. He was called to manage command and maintenance, like colonization, diplomacy, creation of buildings and units, supervising of mines and resources, building and assigning of fleets, conversion of systems to one's own side, recruiting of characters, (60 in the game, both from the movies and the Expanded Universe) and dispatching characters or units to systems (up to 200 available) or fleets.\nEvery element of the game had its own encyclopedia-like card with a short description and abilities sheet. This amounted to a total of several hundred encyclopedia cards.\n\n\u2022 Objectives\n\nThe standard objective of each game was to take the headquarters of the enemy (Coruscant or the mobile Rebel base) and capture the two leaders of the opposite side: The Alliance had to capture Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, and the Empire's objectives were to capture Luke Skywalker and Mon Mothma.\nAnother mode was also available where you only had to find and destroy the enemy's headquarters.\n\n\u2022 Faction strengths and weaknesses\n\nBoth the Rebels and the Empire have their own strengths and weaknesses, which affect how a player should use them.\n\u2022 Rebels: The primary strength for the Rebels is that, like in the movies, the Empire has to look for their headquarters, and the Rebels can move it to another location. The Rebels start with a larger number of diplomatic, recruiting, and combat characters than the Empire does, so they can start off with missions to move planets to their side or recruiting characters more quickly and at a higher rate than the Empire. The Rebels main weakness is that, like in the movies, they are outgunned. It isnt until later in the game that they can get ships that can match what the Empire can build, but they compensate somewhat by having much better fighters than Empire for most of the game. Also, the Rebels are unable to do Assassination Missions, since the Rebels are the \"good side.\"\n\n\u2022 Empire:: The Imperial Fleet outguns the Rebellion for most of the game. Part of this is because the Empire starts with the ability to construct Star Destroyers, which the Rebels starships cant compete against for most of the game. The Empire also starts with a larger number of skilled generals and admirals (who receive an additional 50% bonus to their Leadership Skill if the Emperor resides on Coruscant), giving it an edge in battles, and it can research better ships and troop types more quickly. The Empires weakness is that, unlike the Rebels, it cant move its headquarters. Its always located on Coruscant and will be the constant target for the Rebels. The Empire also doesnt start with as many recruiting or diplomatic characters as the Rebels do. Also, although the Empires starships are better for most of the game, their starting fighters are extremely weak.\n\n\u2022 Unit management\n\nThere were several kinds of buildable units. Each kind could be constructed by one of three construction facilities.\n\u2022 Installations were buildings on a planet's surface or in orbit. They could be construction facilities or defense installations.\n\n\u2022 Mines produced raw material from planets, while refineries refined them into processed materials that could be used for construction, and both increased maintenance and thus allowed for larger military forces.\n\n\u2022 Construction Yards built other installations.\n\n\u2022 Troop Training Facilities created troops and special forces.\n\n\u2022 Shipyards constructed starships and fighter squadrons.\n\n\u2022 Planetary cannons attacked assaulting starships and troop transports, and the Ion Cannon is also used to defend units escaping a blockade.\n\n\u2022 Shield generators defended everything on the planet from orbital bombardment.\n\n\u2022 Troops were used to conquer and defend planets, and to claim uninhabited systems.\n\n\u2022 Starships could blockade systems, unleash orbital bombardments, and be the platforms for planetary assault. They could also carry troops and starfighters up to their respective limits and an unlimited number of characters and special forces.\n\n\u2022 Starfighters could be stationed on planets or capital starships, and were built in squadrons. They could fight in fleet battles, and add to bombardment and detection ratings.\n\n\u2022 Special forces included spies, saboteurs, and long-range reconnaissance teams.\n\nAs research progressed, new units and facilities became available for construction. Research could be sped up significantly by ordering characters with the corresponding ability to conduct design missions. Characters could also have the ability to research facilities, starships or troop designs.\nSometime during the game a planet could be hit with a Natural Disaster that would destroy resources and energy on the planet, making it worthless. At the same time, new resources can pop up on a planet.\n\n\u2022 Characters and starships\n\nThere were two kinds of characters in the game: major and minor ones.\nMajor characters were always available at the beginning of the game, while most minor ones had to be recruited. Only major characters could embark on recruitment missions and could not be killed in the line of duty but could be injured, removing them from play for a while.\nMinor characters could sometimes be generated Force-sensitive and could be trained by Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader, to augment their abilities. The main characters with Force control could also enhance their abilities by conducting missions. Characters with higher Force ratings had better abilities in diplomacy, espionage, and combat, and could therefore perform missions with a higher chance of success. Force sensitivity could be a two-edged sword however, as Force-sensitive characters stationed in a system could detect the presence of enemy Force-sensitives trying to perform a mission there, and foil the mission automatically. Princess Leia could become Force-sensitive, but only if Luke Skywalker learns of his heritage (i.e. if he meets Darth Vader in combat and is not captured) and the two meet on a planet or ship somewhere in the galaxy where he reveals that she is his twin sister.\nSome characters could be given military ranks by the player to put them in specific roles: an admiral increased a fleet's performance by enhancing firepower, shields and speed; a general increased the performance of troops and reduced the likelihood of successful enemy missions on a friendly planet; a commander increased the combat efficiency and speed of starfighter squadrons. Ship-based squadrons also launch faster with a commander present.\nSome characters can betray your side to the enemy if the winning conditions favor the other side. Traitors can only be detected by Force-sensitive characters, and the only ways to remove a traitor are to either improve your winning conditions or retire the character, where retiring means the character is out of the game entirely.\nAll of the Rebel starfighters have shields and hyperdrive, while the TIE Defender is the only starfighter the Empire has that has shields and hyperdrive, and does not start inside a capital ship.\n\n\u2022 Units\n\nGround Forces are used to defend your planets from assaults, missions, and stop uprisings, where the latter is often a risky, and not a favored choice among veteran players to control planets. They are also used to assault enemy planets.\nSpecial forces units are used to conduct various missions in lieu of characters, except Diplomacy, Recruitment, and Jedi Training. These units are most often used as opposed to characters to conduct missions in dangerous areas if failure is high.\n\n\u2022 Facilities\n\nThese structures are avaliable to players as long as they have access to at least one Construction Yard. Each structure needs at least one unit of energy (blue), with mines needing one unit of raw materials (red).\n\u2022 Advanced Contruction Yard - Builds facilities and planetary defenses at twice the speed of normal construction yards\n\n\u2022 Advanced Shipyard - Builds starships and fighters at twice the speed of normal shipyards\n\n\u2022 Advanced Training Facilities - Builds ground and special forces at twice the speed of normal training facilities\n\n\u2022 Construction Yard - Allows construction of facilities and planetary defenses\n\n\u2022 Death Star Shield (Empire Only) - Prevents the enemy to conduct an attack run on a Death Star in the event of a battle over the planet\n\n\u2022 GenCore Level I Shield Generator - Shields a system from enemy bombardments. Two shield generators stops planetary assaults\n\n\u2022 GenCore Level II - Shields a system from enemy bombardments at twice the strength as the Level I and uses less maintance points. Two shield generators stops planetary assaults\n\n\u2022 KDY-150 Ion Cannon - Allows evacuation of systems under blockade without the threat of being intercepted by enemy ships or fighters\n\n\u2022 LNR Series I Planetary Battery - Fires on bombarding ships in a blockade dealing damage to one target. If a general is on the planet, has a chance to significantly damage higher tiered ships and destroy lower tiered ships\n\n\u2022 LNR Series II Planetary Battery - Fires on bombarding ships in a blockade dealing significant damage than the Series I and can destroy mid-tiered ships. If a general is on the planet, has a chance to destroy any ship, regardless of tier.\n\n\u2022 Mine - Mines raw materials for use of refining. Adds 50 maintance points to the maintance pool if there's a vacant refinery.\n\n\u2022 Orbital Shipyard - Allows construction of starships and starfighters\n\n\u2022 Refinery - Refines raw materials into refined materials used in construction of facilities, troops, and ships. Adds 50 maintance points to the maintance pool if there is a vacant mine.\n\n\u2022 Training Facilities - Allows training of ground and special forces\n\n\u2022 Missions\n\nAll characters and certain special forces can conduct any mission against the opponent, or assists in your hand. Success on the mission depends on the stats of the character in question. The mission list is as follows:\n\u2022 Assassination Mission (Empire Only) - Injure or kill a targeted character\n\n\u2022 Abduction - Captures a target character\n\n\u2022 Espionage - Gathers information on a targeted system's defenses, personal, facilities, fleets in orbit, and ongoing missions, where a successful mission can lead to information from another system. (Rebel players who successfully conduct an espionage mission on Coruscant can obtain information on several enemy-controlled planets)\n\n\u2022 Incite Uprising - Attempts to sway public opinion against your opponent which could lead to the planet going neutral or thrown into a full-blown uprising\n\n\u2022 Sabotage - Destroys a targeted installation, planetary defense structure, regiment, planetary-based starfighters, or any starship in orbit over a planet.\n\n\u2022 Death Star Sabotage (Rebel Only) - Destroys a Death Star over a planet\n\n\u2022 Recruitment - Recruits other characters into your army\n\n\u2022 Facility Design Research - Improves the capabilities of Construction Yards to research and develop new structures\n\n\u2022 Troop Design Research - Improves the capabilities of Training Facilities to research and develop new troop regiments\n\n\u2022 Starship Design Research - Improves the capabilities of Shipyards to research and develop new starships\n\n\u2022 Diplomacy - Sways public opinion to your side in an attempt to either convince them to join your side, or max out public opinion\n\n\u2022 Rescue - Rescues captured characters from your opponent\n\n\u2022 Jedi Training - When present with at least a Jedi Knight or better, trains targeted Force-Sensitive characters to improve stats overall\n\n\u2022 Subdue Uprising - Stops an uprising on a planet you control\n\n\u2022 Sectors and planets\n\nThe player is given three options for the size of the galaxy, impacting which sectors are in play and potentially the length of the game.\nThe smallest galaxy has 10 sectors, with three fully discovered core sectors: Corellian, Sesswenna, and Sluis; and seven unexplored sectors on the outer rim where the initial location of the Rebel base could be randomly generated: Calaron, Churba, Dufilvan, Mayagil, Moddell, Orus, and Sumitra. The medium size adds Farfin to the core and four to the outer rim: Glythe, Jospro, Kanchen, and Quelli. The largest has a total of 20 sectors, adding Dolomar and Fakir to the core and Abrion, Atrivis, and Xappyh to the outer rim.\nBatteries and planetary shields protect your planet from opposing fleets. Two shield generators on a planet will prevent the opponent from landing troops where the batteries will open fire on a blockading fleet that is bombarding. The batteries can inflict serious damage on an enemy fleet where one with a General has a strong chance to destroy a capital ship after bombardment, including a Super Star Destroyer.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nMany of the planet locations in the game are placed in the galaxy map in the wrong places canonically. Those marked in bold are correct. Those placed incorrectly have their correct locations in parenthesis ( ).\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Star Wars Year By Year: A Visual History, New Edition\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022",

The outer half-circle featured large [[hangar]]s lined with forward docking claws.<ref name=\"Databank\">{{Databank|trade-federation-battleship|Trade Federation Battleship}}</ref> Lucrehulks were capable warships, and the biggest vessel fielded by the CIS navy.

The ship contained 50 conference rooms for meetings with clients. These rooms were made to place clients at a disadvantage using \"concentration deficit\" chairs and remote gas emitters.<ref name=\"CL\" />\n\nAboard the bridge, the Lucrehulk was dominated by a throne-like navigation station with pilot droids on navigation computers. The Bridge was extremely well defended with triple blast doors and reinforced hull plating. Neimoidian officials rarely left the Bridge in case one of their colleagues were to form an alliance against them.

    "plain_text": "Sources indicate there is the regular battleship and then the Droid Control Ship variant\n1\nattack run]] on the Droid Control Ship\nThe ''Lucrehulk''-class battleship, also known as a Droid Control Ship, or Trade Federation battleship, was a modified Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighter that was used by the Trade Federation and the Confederacy of Independent Systems and manufactured by Hoersch-Kessel Drive Inc.\n\n\u2022 Characteristics\n\nTey How and Daultay Dofine discover that the control ship is about to explode\n\n\u2022 Description\n\nThe Lucrehulk-class Battleship was a massive, lumbering and imposing battleship, illegally modified from Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighters,Star Wars: Ships of the Galaxy and produced by Hoersch-Kessel Drive Inc.. Because they were not originally designed for conflict, Lucrehulk vessels reflected their conversion into warships. The most notable difference in a regular Lucrehulk-class Battleship and a Droid Control Ship was the large communications array on its dorsal hull.Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition The sensor arrays of the starship encircled the command centerspheres, while giant Central Control Computers designed to radio commands to the massive droid armies from remote locations helped Trade Federation officials command battles far from danger.\nAt over three kilometers in diameter, the Control Ship featured a massive, spherical core ship in the center of the craft that contained the control bridge for usually Neimoidian officers along with its reactor assemblies. The outer half-circle featured large hangars lined with forward docking claws.Trade Federation Battleship Lucrehulks were capable warships, and the biggest vessel fielded by the CIS navy. Lucrehulks were equipped with thick armor and high density shields that could shrug off even the heaviest weaponry, and its heavy armament and shields made the Lucrehulk some of the most potent warships ever deployed.\n\n\u2022 Interior\n\n\u2022 Federation starship\n\nWith Federation officials needing to live aboard the starship for multiple months, the Lucrehulk was effectively an entire planet within realspace. The ship contained 50 conference rooms for meetings with clients. These rooms were made to place clients at a disadvantage using \"concentration deficit\" chairs and remote gas emitters.\nAboard the bridge, the Lucrehulk was dominated by a throne-like navigation station with pilot droids on navigation computers. The Bridge was extremely well defended with triple blast doors and reinforced hull plating. Neimoidian officials rarely left the Bridge in case one of their colleagues were to form an alliance against them. Due to the possibly of facing danger, the bridge could be sealed off with triple blast doors.\n\n\u2022 Hangar bay\n\ns]]\nDesigned to haul massive droid armies, Droid Control Ships featured a complement of 6,520 AATs, 550 MTTs, 50 C-9979 landing craft, 1,500 Vulture-class starfighters, and 139,000 B1-series battle droids.Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know All departures from the hangar were controlled by Hangar Control droids.\n\n\u2022 Role\n\nThe Lucrehulk-class was used as both a transport and a battleship, and could effectively blockade a planet for years. They were heavily armored, but despite this, they were inefficient, expensive, and required frequent maintenance. As such, the primary reason the CIS navy deployed them was for their intimidating appearance.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 Origin\n\nThe Lucrehulk-class was originally designed to haul freight but were modified into battleships for use in blockades. They were granted 42 quad turbolasers. They were utilized as early as the High Republic Era.Star Wars Eclipse &ndash; Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer After the establishment of the Trade Federation Droid Army on the order of Darth Sidious,Star Wars: Star Pilot Lucrehulks were secretly modified into battleships that could house the droid armies. Some were even transformed into Droid Control Ships, which also saw use in blockades but were unique in that they could direct ground-deployed battle droids. Ahead of the Invasion of Naboo, up to one third of the Lucrehulks in the Federation fleet were modified into battleships while keeping the guise of merely being freight craft.\n\n\u2022 Invasion of Naboo\n\nPlan of Dissent\nDuring the Invasion of Naboo, the Trade Federation brought a fleet of Lucrehulk-class Battleships, including a Droid Control Ship, to the Mid Rim planet of Naboo over disputes about plasma exports and the taxation of Free Trade Zones.Tarkin In addition to this week-long blockade,Queens Peril the Federation landed troops from its battleships to secure the planet.\nThe control ship was later attacked by Bravo Squadron, but its deflector shield was too strong. In the midst of the battle, the young Force-sensitive pilot Anakin Skywalker accidentally flew inside the ships hangar. As Skywalker attempted to make his escape, he fired upon the droids attacking his fighter and inadvertently fired two proton torpedoes into the starboard main reactor. The Control Ship started blowing up from the inside to Bravo Flights surprise as Skywalker flew from the hanger bay. Finally, the ships sphere exploded from the main reactor overloading, saving the Gungan Grand Army from destruction by disrupting the Control Ships signal, shutting down the B1 battle droids below. The ship's port-side ring survived its destruction.\n\n\u2022 The Clone Wars\n\nYears later, the battleships were secretly converted for war, as a war with the Republic was becoming inevitable, although the conversion was not perfect as turbolasers did not cover every angle. The battleships became part of the fleet of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and saw action in various battles. Several battleships were part of the Christophsis blockade,Cat and Mouse and Captain Mar Tuuk commanded a battleship as head of the Ryloth blockade, although Tuuks ship was destroyed by Anakin Skywalker, who was now a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, during the Battle of Ryloth.Storm Over Ryloth Lucrehulk-class Battleships with their original design having none of the Separatist colors and logos were used in the blockade of Pantora, under the command of Sib Canay. K2-B4 commanded the Lola Sayu defense fleet from a Lucrehulk-class Battleship during the Battle of Lola Sayu.Citadel Rescue During a meeting by the Strategic Advisory Cell at the Strategic Planning Amphitheater, a Lucrehulk'-class Battleship was compared with the Death Star.\nAt one point, General Skywalker told ARC trooper Fives that a Droid Control Ship could be destroyed by hitting its main reactor. Fives used this knowledge during the Battle of Umbara, as he and two fellow clone troopers, Hardcase and Jesse, attempted to target a DH-Omni Support Vessels reactor. Lucrehulk Battleships were also used in the Battle of Coruscant,III the final major Separatist offensive of the Clone Wars.Star Wars: On the Front Lines'\n\n\u2022 Age of the Empire\n\nMosey Cimmaron and Cal Kestis talking about the Bedlam Raiders base\nIn 14 BBY,Star Wars: Timelines dates the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order to 14 BBY. a Lucrehulk-class Battleship was brought to Bracca for the Scrapper Guild.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\nIn 9 BBY, a core ship of the Lucrehulk Primacy was present on Koboh. It was used as a base by the Bedlam Raiders, a group of marauders who used the battle droids present on the ship to increase their power.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor\nDuring the Galactic Civil War the Rebel Alliance utilized a Lucrehulk, Lucrehulk Prime, as a flight school, and was commanded by General Hera Syndulla. Syndulla considered the ship to be a symbol of tyranny that was converted into one of hope.Victorys Price: An Alphabet Squadron Novel\nDecades later in 35 ABY, several Lucrehulks were part of the Citizens' Fleet which successfully took part in the Battle of Exegol against Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal.IX\n\n\u2022 Behind the scenes\n\nThe Lucrehulk-class Battleship first appeared in the 1999 film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and was first identified in the 2017 video game, Star Wars Battlefront II.Star Wars Battlefront II Although Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Rise of the Separatists, and Star Wars Jedi Master Magazine 1 state that it holds 139,000 B1-series battle droids, Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles states that it has a capacity to carry 329,000. It also states that the Lucrehulk-class Battleship holds 6,250 Armored Assault Tanks, while Star Wars: Ships of the Galaxy establishes 6,520. Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles and Star Wars Jedi Master Magazine 1 also states that it is 3,170 meters in length, while previous sources such as the databank established 3,356.9 meters.

He was the ''[[lor pelek]]'' of the [[Korun/Legends|Korunnai]], and their military leader during the local [[Summertime War]]. Kar and his people sided with the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] during the Clone Wars, but his actions were judged as \"[[Crime against civilization|crimes against civilization]]\" and he was ultimately defeated and arrested by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]].\n\nYears later, Kar was forced to serve as a host for [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] warlord [[Cronal]], until he was saved by [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] during the [[Battle of Mindor]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Can any of them survive? Cast out alone, without supplies, without weapons&mdash;''\"<br />\"''I did.|Mace Windu and Kar Vastor on ''[[tan pel'trokal]]''|<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />}}\nBorn a [[Korun/Legends|Korun]], Kar Vastor's early life seemed ordinary, though he was more in touch with ''Pelekotan'' ([[The Force/Legends|The Force]] in the Korun language, the literal translation was \"jungle mind\") than most. It was the [[Summertime War]] which forever changed Kar's destiny, as well as the destiny of [[Haruun Kal/Legends|Haruun Kal]]. At the age of fourteen, Kar Vastor saw his whole family massacred by [[jup]]s, also known as jungle prospectors. How Kar Vastor escaped is a mystery. The stories among the Korunnai were contradictory, and Kar himself would not discuss it.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nVastor was abandoned in the jungle without weapons, [[grasser]]s, [[Akk dog/Legends|akk dogs]], people, or food and supplies of any kind. For most beings, it was a [[Death/Legends|death]] sentence. However, Kar survived on his own for more than a standard year.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nIn the jungle, he learned all his impressive [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]], but lost the ability to form normal speech like most other [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] beings. [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] later suspected that it was the price Kar paid for his survival: he traded ''Pelekotan'' power for his humanity.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nIn the jungle, Kar likely discovered the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Starship/Legends|starship]] that carried the Korun ancestors to Haruun Kal and used the starship armor to build his weapon of choice: [[vibroshield]]s. A weapon of Kar's own design, they were shield-shaped [[Vibro-ax/Legends|vibro-axes]]. The sonic generators that powered the shields were fully sealed, and therefore were resistant to the metal-eating molds and fungi of the jungle. Also, because the starship armor was a superconductor; that is, it remained the same temperature throughout; not even a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] blade could cut through the shields.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\n===''Lor pelek'' in the Summertime War===\n{{Quote|There's a lor pelek who travels with Depa's band. He's&hellip;very powerful. More than powerful. If we can get Besh and Chalk to him before they start the twitches, he might be able to save them.|[[Nick Rostu]]|<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />}}\nKar Vastor grew to become a ''lor pelek''; a ''jungle master'' shaman, witch doctor, wizard, and demon. In Korun legend, the ''lor pelek'' was a person of great power, and great peril. Kar Vastor lived up to his title&mdash;he was as unpredictable as the jungle, bringing life or death, a gift or a wound. In some Korun stories, a ''lor pelek'' was not a being at all, but was rather ''Pelekotan'' incarnate: the avatar of the \"jungle mind.\" Kar Vastor, although still [[Human/Legends|Human]], became the avatar of the jungle's darkness.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nDuring the Summertime War, Kar Vastor formed a clan he named the [[Akk Guard]]. Kar and the Guards were masters of both unarmed and melee combat, as well as the use of the Force. Without proper training, their usage of the Force was without grace; they relied on natural instincts, their Force powers aggressive and wild.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nThirty-five years before the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] Mace Windu visited the Koruns and shared with them tales of the Jedi. Kar Vastor possibly heard those tales, ending with he and the Akk Guards starting to mirror Jedi Knights. When Kar accepted a man as his Akk Guard, the man would build his own shields, in much the same manner as Jedi built their own lightsabers. Beginning with this ritual, the Akk Guards became a dark simulacrum of the Jedi. They relied on instinct while the Jedi relied on training; they used anger and aggression as sources of power, while the Jedi based their power upon serenity and defense; they used their shields as swords, while the Jedi used their swords as shields.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" /><ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\nKar and the Akk Guards used their vibroshields to deflect blaster bolts and projectiles in the same manner as the Jedi. This skill may have also been the result of tales of Jedi training told by Mace Windu.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nVastor's experience in the jungle determined his view on ''Tan Pel'trokal'': Jungle Justice, a penalty devised by Korun culture, to punish crimes deserving death. Vastor sent all his captives in the Summertime War into the jungle without weapons, clothing, or other supplies. Because no captive could survive the jungle to tell the tale, the [[Balawai]] believed the Korun always killed their captives, further darkening the war.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nKar was a member of [[Gh\u00f4sh Windu]]. He believed himself to be its last surviving member before his d\u1ecfshalo (clan brother), Mace Windu, revisited the planet. The Summertime War had slowly killed the whole clan.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nDespite the fact that every Korun could use the Force, and that Kar Vastor with the Akk Guards were nearly untouchable, the Korunnai were slowly losing the war. The Korunnai lived in the jungle, and because the jungle's fungi would eat almost every kind of metal, it made it impossible for the Korunnai to use technological weapons and equipment in the jungle. They fought with slug rifles, while Balawai used blasters. The Summertime War was also a war of extermination. Enemies were killed at first sight, regardless of age and conditions. While the Balawai could hide non-combatants in the city, the Koruns had no place to hide their own. However, as the name hinted, the Summertime War would halt during seasons like autumn and winter, and so the Korunnai still had time to recover.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n{{Quote|We kill seppies because they give weapons and supplies to the Balawai.

Assigned by the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] to liberate the system, Depa fought alongside Kar Vastor, his Akk Guards, and the Korunnai. With her mastery of the Force and the seventh lightsaber combat form known as [[Form VII/Legends|Vaapad]], the tide started to change. The Korunnai considered Depa a goddess and their only hope. However with each victory, with each killing, the darkness of the jungle and the terror of warfare began to corrupt and [[Torture/Legends|torture]] Depa. Depa's mastery in Vaapad furthered the corruption as she channeled her inner darkness to be the weapon of light.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nAs a result, the actions of Korun combatants darkened, both in reality and in tales, and the Balawai responded in kind. Working together, Kar and Depa invented the name \"Upland Liberation Front\" to describe their fighting force. This proved to be a successful tactic to confuse the enemy; the Balawai kept trying to figure out the tactics and pattern of the Front's attack, which was always futile because there ''was'' no Upland Liberation Front. The Front was merely a name to blame every attack on; the Korun fighting force was just a group of Humans scavenging for supplies and struggling for survival.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nFinally, the Separatists fell back and abandoned the planet to the Balawai themselves. However, they continued to supply them with weapons and equipment. The Korunnai were unable to celebrate as long as the Balawai existed. As a result, Depa remained with the Korunnai and fought with them, neglecting any order from the Council. Determined to teach her Master a lesson of war and its darkness, Depa and Kar set up a terrifying scene to draw Mace Windu to the planet.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nWhen Windu came, [[Nick Rostu]], [[Chalk]], [[Lesh]], and [[Besh/Legends|Besh]] were sent to meet him. However, Mace was captured by Balawai commander Colonel [[Lorz Geptun|Geptun]]. Geptun interrogated him, then released him in exchange for three thousand [[Galactic Credit Standard/Legends|credits]]. Mace had to, as part of the release deal, try to stop Depa's atrocities against Balawai. Unknown by Mace, Geptun had monitored his lightsaber's frequency so that his satellites would tell him whenever Mace turned on his lightsaber. This meant that the Colonel could track him as he met with the Korunnai.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nMace was saved from an ambush by Nick and his companions, and so joined them to find Depa. They had a brief fight with gunships, one of which Mace destroyed. This unlocked a blood fever in him. Not long after, Lesh died of [[Fever wasp/Legends|fever wasps]]. Chalk and Besh were infected. Nick realized that Kar might be able to save Chalk and Besh. They took a Balawai outpost, put the two in suspended animation, and sent Nick off for Kar. Mace stayed as a guard. When a nearby volcano erupted, Balawai children called for help. Being a Jedi, Mace saved them. More Balawai came, in steamcrawlers. Mace tried to negotiate the release of children and the abandonment of the outpost, but the Balawai were desperate. Just as Mace was near success, Kar and the Akk Guards came.<ref name=\"shatterpoint\" />\n\nThe superhuman skill and strength of the Korun easily killed the Balawai. Kar entered the bunker, and Mace found himself struggling with blood fever. Kar used his Force powers to effectively show Mace his dark side.

He was the lor pelek of the Korunnai, and their military leader during the local Summertime War. Kar and his people sided with the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, but his actions were judged as \"crimes against civilization\" and he was ultimately defeated and arrested by Jedi Master Mace Windu.\nYears later, Kar was forced to serve as a host for Imperial warlord Cronal, until he was saved by Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Mindor.\n\n\u2022 Biography\n\n\u2022 Early life\n\nMace Windu and Kar Vastor on tan pel'trokal\nBorn a Korun, Kar Vastors early life seemed ordinary, though he was more in touch with Pelekotan (The Force in the Korun language, the literal translation was \"jungle mind\") than most. It was the Summertime War which forever changed Kars destiny, as well as the destiny of Haruun Kal. At the age of fourteen, Kar Vastor saw his whole family massacred by jups, also known as jungle prospectors. How Kar Vastor escaped is a mystery. The stories among the Korunnai were contradictory, and Kar himself would not discuss it.\nVastor was abandoned in the jungle without weapons, grassers, akk dogs, people, or food and supplies of any kind. For most beings, it was a death sentence. However, Kar survived on his own for more than a standard year.\nIn the jungle, he learned all his impressive Force powers, but lost the ability to form normal speech like most other sentient beings. Mace Windu later suspected that it was the price Kar paid for his survival: he traded Pelekotan power for his humanity.\nIn the jungle, Kar likely discovered the Jedi starship that carried the Korun ancestors to Haruun Kal and used the starship armor to build his weapon of choice: vibroshields. A weapon of Kar's own design, they were shield-shaped vibro-axes. The sonic generators that powered the shields were fully sealed, and therefore were resistant to the metal-eating molds and fungi of the jungle. Also, because the starship armor was a superconductor; that is, it remained the same temperature throughout; not even a lightsaber blade could cut through the shields.\n\n\u2022 Lor pelek in the Summertime War\n\nNick Rostu\nKar Vastor grew to become a lor pelek; a jungle master shaman, witch doctor, wizard, and demon. In Korun legend, the lor pelek was a person of great power, and great peril. Kar Vastor lived up to his title&mdash;he was as unpredictable as the jungle, bringing life or death, a gift or a wound. In some Korun stories, a lor pelek was not a being at all, but was rather Pelekotan incarnate: the avatar of the \"jungle mind.\" Kar Vastor, although still Human, became the avatar of the jungle's darkness.\nDuring the Summertime War, Kar Vastor formed a clan he named the Akk Guard. Kar and the Guards were masters of both unarmed and melee combat, as well as the use of the Force. Without proper training, their usage of the Force was without grace; they relied on natural instincts, their Force powers aggressive and wild.\nThirty-five years before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Mace Windu visited the Koruns and shared with them tales of the Jedi. Kar Vastor possibly heard those tales, ending with he and the Akk Guards starting to mirror Jedi Knights. When Kar accepted a man as his Akk Guard, the man would build his own shields, in much the same manner as Jedi built their own lightsabers. Beginning with this ritual, the Akk Guards became a dark simulacrum of the Jedi. They relied on instinct while the Jedi relied on training; they used anger and aggression as sources of power, while the Jedi based their power upon serenity and defense; they used their shields as swords, while the Jedi used their swords as shields.The New Essential Chronology\nKar and the Akk Guards used their vibroshields to deflect blaster bolts and projectiles in the same manner as the Jedi.

Despite Kar's abilities and leadership, the Korun were losing badly, and facing extinction.\nThe arrival of Jedi Master Depa Billaba changed everything. Assigned by the Jedi Council to liberate the system, Depa fought alongside Kar Vastor, his Akk Guards, and the Korunnai. With her mastery of the Force and the seventh lightsaber combat form known as Vaapad, the tide started to change. The Korunnai considered Depa a goddess and their only hope.

He lacks the political acumen needed to elevate our House to a position of true entitlement, and along with it the awareness to recognize that the time has come for Naboo to exploit its matchless resources and join the modern galaxy. Instead, he and his cronies, in complete political ineptitude, want to keep us caged in the past.|A young Palpatine, to Hego Damask|<ref name=\"Darth P\" />}}\n'''House Palpatine''', also sometimes called the '''Imperial family''', was a dynastic [[Noble/Legends|noble]] [[Human/Legends|human]] family originally from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] in the [[Mid Rim/Legends|Mid Rim]] of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] that became the ruling family of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. House Palpatine was known throughout its history on Naboo as a conservative and isolationist family, though it was not as prominent or wealthy as some of the other [[Royal House of Naboo/Legends|Royal Houses]] of Naboo.\n\nIn [[65 BBY/Legends|65 BBY]], House Palpatine was rendered almost extinct when the eldest son of [[Cosinga Palpatine]], who insisted on being known simply as Palpatine, exterminated all of his immediate family, including his father. Palpatine was initiated into the [[Order of the Sith Lords]] by [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Darth Plagueis]] as Darth Sidious, and later came to rule the galaxy as [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] of the Galactic Empire for more than two decades. During his rule, many claimants contended blood relation to House Palpatine, and similarly, pretenders sought to legitimize their bid for the throne after the Emperor's fall. The House's color was scarlet, prominently featured on the family crest, which depicted a [[Veermok/Legends|veermok]], an [[Aiwha/Legends|aiwha]] and a [[Zalaaca/Legends|zalaaca]].\n\n==History==\n===House Palpatine===\n{{Quote|The Naboo have a legend about six impenetrable gates that hold back chaos. House Palpatine is one of those gates, Damask.|Cosinga Palpatine, to Hego Damask|<ref name=\"Darth P\" />}}\nAccording to [[Cosinga Palpatine|Cosinga]], [[Royal House of Naboo/Legends|House]] Palpatine was one of the six impenetrable gates that held back [[Chaos/Legends|chaos]] in [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] [[Naboo religion|mythology]].<ref name=\"Darth P\" /> The patronym may also have derived from an ancient name of state, or the name of a region on Naboo.<ref name=\"Darth P\" /> The House's rigid conservatism had deep roots in the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] history. Around [[135 BBY]], again according to Cosinga, [[Cosinga Palpatine's grandfather|his grandfather]] discovered that [[House Veruna|Houses Veruna]] and [[House Tapalo|Tapalo]] were behind [[Gungan\u2013Naboo War#Naboo mercenary conflict|the war]] with the [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]]. Thus he challenged [[Bon Tapalo/Legends|Bon Tapalo's]] [[Tapalo|father]] to a duel of honor in [[Convergence/Legends|Convergence]], House Palpatine's private resort in the [[Lake Country/Legends|Lake Country]] area. Palpatine succumbed to his wounds at Tapalo's blade.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nIn [[82 BBY/Legends|82 BBY]], [[Palpatine's mother|Cosinga Palpatine's wife]] gave birth to their eldest son, [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], who later insisted on being known only by the cognomen in order to spite his [[Parent/Legends|father]] and the rest of the family. The couple also had at least [[Palpatine's first brother|two]] other [[Palpatine's second brother|sons]] and [[Palpatine's first sister|two]] [[Palpatine's second sister|daughters]].<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\n[[File:PlagueisCover.jpg|thumb|left|250px|right|A young Palpatine and his Sith mentor, Darth Plagueis]]\nBy [[65 BBY/Legends|65 BBY]], Cosinga Palpatine was allied with Naboo's conservative party in opposition to the election of Bon Tapalo as the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|people's]] next [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|king]]. If elected, Tapalo intended to integrate Naboo into the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] as a full member state, an action which, Cosinga and his political allies believed, would be to the planet's disadvantage. The conservatives sought to preserve Naboo's independence, but were also concerned that their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld's]] market would be ruined if Naboo joined [[The galaxy/Legends|the greater galaxy]], thus exposing it to commercial entities that wanted to exploit its natural [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]] resources.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nSince the family patriarch was an opponent of Bon Tapalo, House Palpatine was publicly noted for its allegiance to the conservative faction. In secret, however, the House was divided by the political disagreements between the elder Palpatine and his eldest son, the seventeen-year-old Palpatine. Though he was heir apparent to the House's wealth and properties due to his status as firstborn son, the younger Palpatine was bitter and resentful over his family's lack of prestige in comparison to their royal peers. Despite the pride he felt for his ancestry, Palpatine hated his entire family: his father for not being intelligent enough to place House Palpatine in a position of true entitlement, his mother for her subservient nature and lack of opinions, and his younger siblings for treating him like an interloper.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nFurthermore, Palpatine believed that his father's actions were motivated more by greed than concern for the future of Naboo. [[Bon Tapalo's opponent|Tapalo's chief rival]] for the monarchy was also the brother of [[Cosinga Palpatine's mistress]], and thus the son suspected that the father was taking advantage of the election in order to attain a position of power in the government. As far as Palpatine was concerned, his father did not deserve power if his only means for obtaining it was through an affair with his ally's sister.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nThe elder and younger Palpatine never fully reconciled as father and son. Although they both shared a penchant for violence and fast [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeders]], their differences far outweighed the few traits they had in common. Cosinga Palpatine was frequently forced to intervene on his heir's behalf due to the boy's habit for causing mischief, using both his wealth and his aristocratic position to cover up a significant number of petty crimes and misdemeanors committed, insufferably, by his own son.

    "plain_text": "Galactic Empire]]\nA young Palpatine, to Hego Damask\nHouse Palpatine, also sometimes called the Imperial family, was a dynastic noble human family originally from the planet Naboo in the Mid Rim of the galaxy that became the ruling family of the Galactic Empire. House Palpatine was known throughout its history on Naboo as a conservative and isolationist family, though it was not as prominent or wealthy as some of the other Royal Houses of Naboo.\nIn 65 BBY, House Palpatine was rendered almost extinct when the eldest son of Cosinga Palpatine, who insisted on being known simply as Palpatine, exterminated all of his immediate family, including his father. Palpatine was initiated into the Order of the Sith Lords by Darth Plagueis as Darth Sidious, and later came to rule the galaxy as Emperor of the Galactic Empire for more than two decades. During his rule, many claimants contended blood relation to House Palpatine, and similarly, pretenders sought to legitimize their bid for the throne after the Emperors fall. The Houses color was scarlet, prominently featured on the family crest, which depicted a veermok, an aiwha and a zalaaca.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 House Palpatine\n\nCosinga Palpatine, to Hego Damask\nAccording to Cosinga, House Palpatine was one of the six impenetrable gates that held back chaos in Naboo mythology. The patronym may also have derived from an ancient name of state, or the name of a region on Naboo. The Houses rigid conservatism had deep roots in the planets history. Around 135 BBY, again according to Cosinga, his grandfather discovered that Houses Veruna and Tapalo were behind the war with the Gungans. Thus he challenged Bon Tapalos father to a duel of honor in Convergence, House Palpatines private resort in the Lake Country area. Palpatine succumbed to his wounds at Tapalos blade.\nIn 82 BBY, Cosinga Palpatines wife gave birth to their eldest son, Palpatine, who later insisted on being known only by the cognomen in order to spite his father and the rest of the family. The couple also had at least two other sons and two daughters.\nBy 65 BBY, Cosinga Palpatine was allied with Naboos conservative party in opposition to the election of Bon Tapalo as the peoples next king. If elected, Tapalo intended to integrate Naboo into the Galactic Republic as a full member state, an action which, Cosinga and his political allies believed, would be to the planets disadvantage. The conservatives sought to preserve Naboos independence, but were also concerned that their homeworld's market would be ruined if Naboo joined the greater galaxy, thus exposing it to commercial entities that wanted to exploit its natural plasma resources.\nSince the family patriarch was an opponent of Bon Tapalo, House Palpatine was publicly noted for its allegiance to the conservative faction. In secret, however, the House was divided by the political disagreements between the elder Palpatine and his eldest son, the seventeen-year-old Palpatine. Though he was heir apparent to the Houses wealth and properties due to his status as firstborn son, the younger Palpatine was bitter and resentful over his familys lack of prestige in comparison to their royal peers. Despite the pride he felt for his ancestry, Palpatine hated his entire family: his father for not being intelligent enough to place House Palpatine in a position of true entitlement, his mother for her subservient nature and lack of opinions, and his younger siblings for treating him like an interloper.\nFurthermore, Palpatine believed that his fathers actions were motivated more by greed than concern for the future of Naboo. Tapalos chief rival for the monarchy was also the brother of Cosinga Palpatines mistress, and thus the son suspected that the father was taking advantage of the election in order to attain a position of power in the government. As far as Palpatine was concerned, his father did not deserve power if his only means for obtaining it was through an affair with his ally's sister.\nThe elder and younger Palpatine never fully reconciled as father and son. Although they both shared a penchant for violence and fast landspeeders, their differences far outweighed the few traits they had in common. Cosinga Palpatine was frequently forced to intervene on his heirs behalf due to the boys habit for causing mischief, using both his wealth and his aristocratic position to cover up a significant number of petty crimes and misdemeanors committed, insufferably, by his own son. At one point, Palpatine unintentionally killed two pedestrians in a landspeeder accident. His father forbade him from ever driving again, but the sons persistent defiance eventually wore the elder Palpatine down. Cosinga Palpatine later purchased a prototype patrol-grade Flash as a present for his son, which Palpatine interpreted as a bribe. But as a result of his extreme enthusiasm for fast vehicles, the younger Palpatine accepted the bribe and went on to become a successful competitive racer.\n\n\u2022 Massacre\n\nPalpatine, to Darth Plagueis\nWhile attending the Legislative Youth Program as a student, Palpatine was discovered by Darth Plagueis, a Muun Sith Lord who was publicly known as Hego Damask, the magister of Damask Holdings. Plagueis used his facade to gain Palpatines confidence, and learned of his ambitions and insecurities, as well as the animosity he felt against his entire family. When Cosinga Palpatine attempted to sever his son from Plagueiss influence, the enraged adolescent desperately turned to his mentor for advice. Plagueis urged Palpatine to do anything necessary to achieve emancipation. The young noble took the suggestion as implicit permission to physically rebel against his father&mdash;an opportunity he took advantage of when Cosinga surprised him by bringing the entire family to Hanna City on Chandrila during one of Palpatines Legislative Youth Program conferences. His father planned to move him to Chommell Minor, where he would stay with family friends Janus Greejatus and his family, and so brought with him his wife and his several other children, as well as a number of armed guards.\nJust as Palpatine was preparing to leave Chandrila and return to Naboo with his classmates aboard the Jafan III, he was faced in the central passenger cabin by a recently hired security guard sent to retrieve him. Once out of the Jafan III and aboard the family yacht, Palpatine engaged in an argument with his father that caused their long-standing hatred for each other to burst to the surface. As they travelled through hyperspace along the Hydian Way, Cosinga revealed to his son that he had wanted to murder him since the day of his birth, and Palpatine retorted by saying that he had better do it immediately. When Cosinga took a step in his sons direction, the latter used the Force (prodigious talents for which hed ever kept shrouded or repressed) to telekinetically smash his father against the bulkhead. Palpatine then proceeded to murder his family and the security guards using the dark side of the Force. When the deed was done, he contacted Damask and was assured by his mentor that none would ever learn of his role in the slaughter of House Palpatine. Damask arranged for all evidence of the crime to be purged, and for Palpatine to return to Chandrila. Shortly afterward, Damask revealed his true identity as Darth Plagueis to Palpatine, who subsequently joined the Order of the Sith Lords as Plagueis' apprentice&mdash;neophyte to powerful traditions passed down from a long line of Dark Lords of the Sith&mdash;accepting his new Sith name, Darth Sidious.\n\n\u2022 Darth Sidious: the last Palpatine\n\nDarth Plagueis, to Darth Sidious\nAs the sole remaining member of his House, Palpatine inherited his familys fortune and private properties.Darth Plagueis (pp. 169 and 262) establishes that Palpatine is the sole surviving heir of House Palpatine, and that he inherited all the family assets. The Glove of Darth Vader establishes that claims of direct descent from Palpatine constitute claims of being Palpatines inheritor at least to the throne. In this way, a direct line can be traced between the supposed relatives of Emperor Palpatine and the known relatives that he exterminated in his youth, as claims of descent from the heir of House Palpatine are claims of descent also from his forebears&mdash;i.e., House Palpatine. He later sold his father's estate in the Lake Country before relocating to Coruscant as senator of Naboo. Although Palpatine favored the colors black and blue for his attire, his political colleagues in the Galactic Senate noted that his 500 Republica apartment was mainly arrayed in scarlet hues, to which Palpatine credited his family crest as a source of inspiration.\nPalpatine murdered his Sith Master on the eve of his election as Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic in 32 BBY. He then carried out the Sith Grand Plan according to his own lights, as he understood and wished for it to be, over the next decade. Palpatine's prodigious planning and effort culminated in the creation of the clone army and the outbreak of a galactic civil war, both of which proved essential in manipulating the Senate so that it vested him with dictatorial powers.\nIn the early years of his chancellorship, Palpatine secretly commissioned experiments on the spontaneous generation of life. Utilizing a Bordali woman named Niobi as a \"test subject,\" those initially unpredictable experiments ended up producing a three-eyed mutant that was christened Trioculus. However, the mother and child failed to live up to Palpatines expectations, and were spirited away by Sarcev Quest, one of Palpatines early political allies, to the Spice Mines of Kessel.\nEventually, another three-eyed child, Triclops, was born. Rumor had it that his mother was Palpatines Umbaran aide Sly Moore, who had impregnated herself using DNA from an undisclosed source. Regardless of the veracity of that report, Triclops was regarded as the true son of Palpatine, both by himself and the few high-ranking officials who were aware of his existence.Prophets of the Dark Side'\nBefore his election as Chancellor, Palpatine made certain to obscure his own origins in order to prevent anyone from learning of his shady past, particularly his association with controversial figures such as Hego Damask, Bon Tapalo, and Ars Veruna, and to prevent anyone from tracing a connection between his very public persona and Darth Sidious. By the time of his final term, no family record of Palpatine existed,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary with all records pertaining to his ancestry or immediate family members having mysteriously vanished by the time of the New Orders declaration.Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary' The lack of any records even led some to assume that maybe the name Palpatine was created by Darth Sidious to both enter the political sphere and conceal his identity as a Sith. House Palpatine was, therefore, lost without a trace from the historical record as a result of the actions of its most prominent scion.\n\n\u2022 The Imperial family\n\nC-3PO]]\nIn 19 BBY, Palpatine brought about the culmination of the Grand Plan by declaring himself Emperor of a new galactic government, the Galactic Empire.III Thus, absolute power over the galaxy was placed in Palpatines hands, the kind that attracted ambitious individuals who sought to share in that power and influence. The two brothers Silas and Orman Tagge contemplated the political and financial advantages of uniting their family with the Emperors clan, specifically by positioning their younger sister, Domina Tagge, into the Imperial family via marriage.Star Wars (1977) 36 At the zenith of Palpatines reign in 1 ABY,Star Wars Omnibus: Boba Fett it was believed that he and the deceased Volpau were distant cousins by blood; a plaque accompanying Volpaus remains to Coruscant for ritual incineration aboard the freighter Mingula identified him as Palpatine's third cousin.\nIn the aftermath of Emperor Palpatines demise at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, several claimants who made their bid for the vacant Imperial throne did so while claiming to be blood-related to the deceased monarch. Roganda Ismaren tried to rule the Empire through her offspring, Irek Ismaren, whom she declared to be the late Emperors secret son and true heir.Children of the Jedi However, an investigation into the matter revealed that the true father of her son was actually Sarcev Quest. For decades, there also had existed rumors that Grand Vizier Sate Pestage was a bastard son sired by Palpatine. However, not only was Pestage older than Palpatine, he was also known to have a large extended family of his own.X-Wing: Isards Revenge\nAlthough rumors of Triclopss existence, as well as his connection to Emperor Palpatine, circulated amongst the Empires leading government officials, the Moffs ultimately deemed him insane and unfit to succeed to the throne. Instead, they gave their support to Trioculus, whom they falsely identified as Palpatines illegitimate heir.The Glove of Darth Vader Triclops, rejected by the Empire, eventually spawned his own son with a \"Jedi Princess\" named Kendalina. As the son of the Emperors alleged son, Ken was essentially Palpatine's alleged grandson.\nAnother claimant to the throne was Ederlathh Pallopides, a remote great-niece of Emperor Palpatine. In an attempt to end the Galactic Civil War, Admiral Betl Oxtroe of the Imperial Navy sought to work with the New Republic in reorganizing the Galactic Empire into a constitutional monarchy. Under this reformed regime, the Imperial throne would effectively be reduced to a powerless, symbolic position. Pallopides, too young to rule at eleven years old, was meant to serve as a mere figurehead while the New Republic Provisional Council ruled as the de facto head of government.\nUltimately, none of Palpatines alleged descendants or relatives succeeded him to the throne in an official capacity. At some point after 44 ABY, the New Empire&mdash;a state formed from the last remnants of the first Galactic Empire&mdash;was ruled by a new hereditary monarchy: the bloodline of Emperor Jagged Fel.Legacy (2006) 33 Fels dynasty continued to exist by 138 ABY, with the Empire under the rule of his direct descendant, Empress Marasiah Fel.Legacy \u2014 War 6\n\n\u2022 Family tree\n\nPalpatines great-grandfather]]\n!\nVOL\n!\nPALPM\n.\nDarth Plagueis]], however, Palpatine kills all of his known siblings.

The book about Palpatines apprenticeship under Plagueis, however, introduces House Palpatine, with its patriarch Cosinga Palpatine, thus establishing Palpatine' as a surname, although Emperor Palpatine remains mononymous.\nThe \"Name\" section of the Palpatine article has more details.\n\n\u2022 Appearances\n\nChildren of the Jedi]]\n\n\u2022 Sources\n\n\u2022 The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook\n\n\u2022 Dark Empire Sourcebook\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side\n\n\u2022 Nexus of Power\n\n\u2022 Notes and references",
