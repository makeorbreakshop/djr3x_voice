It's becoming the new nexus for everyone who wants to know as much as Yoda about that galaxy far, far away.|[[Abel G. Pe\u00f1a]]|<ref name=\"1stRelease\">[[Wookieepedia:First anniversary media release]]</ref>}}\n'''Wookieepedia: The Star Wars Wiki''', or simply '''Wookieepedia''', is a [[Wikipedia:Wiki|wiki]] that was launched on [[March 4]], [[2005]] (as '''Star Wars Wiki'''), and strives to be the premier source of information on all aspects of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. Maintained by volunteer editors, Wookieepedia documents content from the current ''Star Wars'' [[canon]] and the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuities, encompassing [[:Category:Theatrical films|films]], novels, [[Video game|games]], and other media, as well as information of value to fans. Wookieepedia is inspired by [[Wikipedia:|Wikipedia]], but expands on ''Star Wars'' information in greater detail and with more freedom than Wikipedia can. Since then, it has expanded to become one of the largest wikis on the Internet.\n\nAs a fan-made encyclopedia hosted by [https://fandom.com Fandom], Wookieepedia is not intended to be a [[Wikipedia:Primary source|primary source]], nor is it a replacement for the [[Encyclopedia (StarWars.com)|Encyclopedia]], the [[Databank (website)|Databank]], or any other official source. Rather, it serves as a fan effort to summarize all aspects of the ''Star Wars'' universe in the best way possible, while pointing the reader to the respective official sources.\n\n==History==\n===The founding of Wookieepedia===\n====Evolution of a wiki====\n{{Quote|So we'd call it Wookieepedia?|Chad Barbry, first suggesting the name of the ''Star Wars'' Wiki|<ref name=\"Talk Archive 1 SWWiki\" />}}\n[[File:Steve-quin-crop.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Co-founder Steven Greenwood at Celebration IV]]\nWikipedia (founded on [[January 15]], [[2001]]) is a collaboratively developed free content encyclopedia, covering a wide variety of topics, and has millions of articles.<ref name=\"WP About\">{{WP|Wikipedia:About}}</ref> It is a general-knowledge encyclopedia, rather than being specific to one topic (as Wookieepedia is ''[[Star Wars]]''&ndash;specific).

As Wikipedia was concerned, only notable items would have complete articles, with the rest of the minor subjects with descriptions on a giant list. Planets, characters, weapons, and vehicles were all done in this manner. Over a short period of time, Greenwood found that he disliked this format and sought another way to gather and place information on the saga and its Expanded Universe.<ref name=\"Riffsyphon1024\">{{U|Riffsyphon1024}}'s recollection of events</ref><ref name=\"WP Not\" /> On [[January 21]], Greenwood posted on a section on a talk page regarding the creation of a new ''Star Wars'' Portal, but suggested that instead of a portal it should be a wiki, citing Halo Wiki (now [https://www.halopedia.org Halopedia]) as inspiration, as well as [[TheForce.net]]'s Completely Unofficial Star Wars Encyclopedia.<ref name=\"Talk Archive 1 SWWiki\" />\n\n[[File:ChadBarbry.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Co-founder Chad Barbry]]\nTwo days later, Chad Barbry entered the discussion, immediately coining the word \"Wookieepedia,\"<ref name=\"Wookieepedia name\"><span class=\"invert-images\">[[File:Wikipedia-Logo.svg|text-top|x16px]]</span> [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Star_Wars&diff=next&oldid=9579325 Difference between revisions of \"Talk:Star Wars\"] on [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]]</ref> while Greenwood proposed \"Wicketpedia\". Together they began working out ideas.<ref name=\"Talk Archive 1 SWWiki\" /> Both agreed that this new project would run alongside Wikipedia as a separate, but equal entity&mdash;something more than simply a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:WikiProject|WikiProject]]. However, since Steven was not sure how a new wiki would be created, Barbry contacted {{Srlink|User:Angela|Angela}} of then Wikicities (later Wikia, now Fandom) and requested the creation of the new wiki.\n\n====Wiki creation====\n[[File:SWW-logo-old.png|thumb|right|The very first Star Wars Wiki logo (5&ndash;22 March 2005)]]\nOther Wikipedia contributors seemed to be getting more hostile toward new ''Star Wars'' articles, so in February 2005, Barbry decided to make a request of the Wikipedia Board of Trustees to make a \"Star Wars Wiki.\" His intent was more than just another WikiProject, but an official sister project similar to Wikiquotes. He thought the best solution was a separate, but linked project&mdash;a project that was separate enough for the \"anti-cruft\" Wikipedians, but still one that was officially Wikipedia, so there would be no need for redundant articles between the projects.\n\nIn early March 2005, after meeting, the board came back with their answer. They did not want to move Wikipedia in the direction proposed by Barbry, but recommended creating a Star Wars Wikia. {{Srlink|User:Angela|Angela}} of [[Wikipedia:Wikia|Wikia]] was on the Board of Trustees and contacted Barbry to let him know of the board's decision and to set up the new Star Wars Wiki.<ref name=\"userpage\">{{Srlink|User:WhiteBoy|Chad Barbry's user page}} on Wookieepedia</ref> Part of the process that Angela set up was creating interwiki links so Wikipedia could link to Star Wars Wiki articles and vice versa.\n\nThe wiki came online on March 4, 2005, although it sat idle for a few days. Barbry, now under the screenname \"WhiteBoy,\"<ref name=\"userpage\" /> was the first non&ndash;Wikia staff user to officially edit the new wiki on [[March 10]], starting with the moving of articles from Wikipedia to Star Wars Wiki space. Later that day, Greenwood joined the site, using his previous Wikipedia screenname.<ref><span class=\"plainlinks\">[{{Fullurl:Special:Contributions/Riffsyphon1024|dir=prev}} Riffsyphon1024's first edits]</span></ref> WhiteBoy was given bureaucrat rights by Wikia on the same day.<ref name=\"First logs\">{{WookCite|url=Special:Log?dir=prev|text=All public logs}}</ref> A third Wikipedian edited that day as well, and was able to add some key image templates to the wiki, before leaving the project altogether.<ref>[[Special:Contributions/AlexTheMartian AlexTheMartian's edits]]</ref> By the first few months, numbers of editors from both Wikipedia and across the web would dramatically increase.\n\nFor a brief time, there was some confusion as to how to move articles over from Wikipedia. Barbry devised a template for use on Wikipedia to place on talk pages of articles of interest, alerting users that the article would be redirected or moved entirely. The idea was to move as many existing articles from Wikipedia to the new wiki, under the [[Wikipedia:GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]], making sure to save those under threat of deletion first, and then \"wookify\" them to the new wiki's standards. The hope was that, though separate, Wikipedians would begin to put the more obscure articles (essentially anything but the most encyclopedic of articles) in the Star Wars Wiki. Main articles, such as [[Wikipedia:Luke Skywalker|Luke Skywalker]], would remain at Wikipedia.\n\nWikipedians in general ultimately saw the Star Wars Wiki as an external site, one not affiliated with Wikipedia enough to actually \"[[Wikipedia:transwiki|transwiki]]\" articles over, like one would with Wikibooks or Wikirecipe. Creating redirects to the Star Wars Wiki was not what the Wikipedians had in mind, and they requested that Barbry and Greenwood immediately cease what they believed was legal transwikification;<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Riffsyphon1024/Archive_1#Transwiking Riffsyphon1024's Archive 1]</ref> however, articles could still be copied and pasted under the GFDL copyleft license and then \"wookified\" to fit the scheme of the ''Star Wars''&ndash;themed wiki, making sure to place an in-universe article in past tense, or remove redundant sentences. In this aspect, it was decided to have ''all'' articles, not just those that were more trivial, lesser known, or more detailed, at the wiki.\n\nLater articles were copied in this fashion and the originals were left alone on Wikipedia for its users to edit under its rules. Eventually Wookieepedia would develop so many articles that Wikipedia would no longer have any to copy. It should also be noted that Wookieepedia was created independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and of any events occurring on Wikipedia.\n\n====Great LucasCruft Purge====\n[[File:SWW-logo-slightly-newer.png|thumb|left|The second Star Wars Wiki logo (22 March 2005 &ndash; 8 January 2006)]]\nIn March of 2005, perhaps unaware of the formation of the new wiki, a Wikipedian (considered by some a [[M:Deletionism|deletionist]] who wished to prove a point) began to place several ''Star Wars'' articles in the Votes for Deletion system (now [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]]) in an attempt to get these articles deleted from Wikipedia. The purge was later dubbed the \"Great LucasCruft Purge\" by Greenwood himself.<ref>The term \"Great LucasCruft Purge\" stemmed from the VfD for [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Great Jedi Purge|Great Jedi Purge]] and was co-coined by Greenwood and [[Wikipedia:User:Kappa|Kappa]].</ref> It was Greenwood's goal to save as many articles from this individual before the damage was made permanent, and would then impede Star Wars Wiki's ability to grow as it did within the first month. One such article that became a focus of this battle was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Order_D6-66 Order D6-66], which became one of the first [[Imperial Order D6-66/Legends|stub articles]] added to the new wiki via the \"transwiki\" process. The purge garnered the Star Wars Wiki a great deal of public attention, which gave some the erroneous impression that Wookieepedia was created because of the purge.\n\n===By year===\n{{Expandsect}}\n====2005====\n=====Community developments=====\nJust days after the official founding, [[Wookieepedia:Administrators|administrative]] powers were given to Greenwood ({{U|Riffsyphon1024}}) by Barbry ({{U|WhiteBoy}}). This set up the dual administrator system until the adminships of the users {{U|QuentinGeorge}}, {{U|Aidje}}, and {{U|SparqMan}} later in the year. Further on, {{U|StarNeptune}}, {{U|MarcK}}, and {{U|Imperialles}} were voted in as administrators in December.\n\n{{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Wookieepedian of the Month|Wookieepedian of the Month (WOTM)}} was first started in June 2005, with Imperialles as the first user to be recognized by the community for his contributions. Aidje, SparqMan, QuentinGeorge, {{U|JustinGann}}, MarcK, {{U|Azizlight}}, and {{U|Silly Dan}} were also awarded WOTM in 2005.<ref name=\"WOTM\">{{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Wookieepedian of the Month/History}}</ref>\n\n=====Content developments=====\nThe wiki, now going under the moniker of \"Wookieepedia,\" developed a steady rate of contributions by new members from all over, and over time lost its reliance on Wikipedia. Eventually Wookieepedia became the primary name for the wiki and an official renaming took place with the creation of a new logo on [[January 8]], 2006, by [[Tracy Duncan]] {{C|{{U|Dark Spork}}}}. It remains Wookieepedia's logo, with the user [[User:Jaden Kenobi|Tyber]] providing a version in higher resolution in 2014 and the user {{U|Master Fredcerique}} updating it in a Pride theme in [[2023]].\n\nJuly brought the first {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Quote of the Day|Quotes of the Day}} on Wookieepedia. The number of quotes later increased and passed through four subcategories, and {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Quote of the Day/In-Universe|QotD/In-Universe}} was the most edited page on Wookieepedia for a time.<ref name=\"Stats\">{{WebCite|url=http://wikistats.wikia.com/wikistats/EN/TablesWikiaSTARWARS.htm|text=Wikistats|nobackup=1}}</ref> In the same month, Wookieepedia's largest ever boost came when an explosion of editors hit the site, sending the wiki's article count over 10,000. Factors to this expansion could be attributed to advertising and the release of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. By the end of the year, Wookieepedia's article count had surpassed 20,000. (See [[#Growth|wiki growth table]] below.)\n\nIn September 2005, {{Srlink|Template:DidYouKnow|Did You Know?}} was created as an experiment and added to the Main Page, where it is now maintained as an active feature.\n\nThe {{Srlink|Forum:Consensus track|Consensus Track}}, a voting and discussion system designed to improve site-wide policies and practices, was formed onto a single page in October 2005. In the same month, [[Eric Przybylski]] of Nav-Computer.com allowed Wookieepedia to use his fan-made sector maps on certain articles. His maps have since been replaced with versions taken directly from official sources.\n\n====2006====\n=====Community developments=====\n{{U|jSarek}}, {{U|Azizlight}}, and {{U|Kuralyov}} were elected administrators in January.<ref name=\"RFA\">{{WookCite|url=Wookieepedia:Requests_for_user_rights/RFA_archive|text=Wookieepedia:Requests for user rights/RFA archive}}</ref> Also in January, Wookieepedia created a [[Memorial to Star Wars creators|Memorial to ''Star Wars'' creators]].<ref name=\"Memorial\">{{WookCite|url=Memorial_to_Star_Wars_creators?oldid=200889|text=Memorial to Star Wars creators: Revision as of 16:24, 12 January 2006}}</ref> Riffsyphon1024 was made bureaucrat in February, joining WhiteBoy.<ref name=\"RiffRights\">{{WookCite|url=Special:UserRights/Riffsyphon1024|text=User rights}}</ref> {{U|Jaymach}}, Silly Dan, and {{U|Darth Culator}} were elected admins in the first half of the year, while SFH, LtNOWIS, Sentry, {{U|Breathesgelatin}}, {{U|Xwing328}}, and {{U|Cull Tremayne}} became admins in the latter half. {{U|Sikon}} was elected bureaucrat in November.\n\n{{U|StarNeptune}}, {{U|Jack Nebulax}}, {{U|CooperTFN}}, {{U|Jaymach}}, Sikon, {{U|SFH}}, {{U|Rmfitzgerald50}}, {{U|Erik Pflueger}}, {{U|Sentry}}, {{U|Ozzel}}, {{U|LtNOWIS}}, and {{U|Borsk Fey'lya}} were Wookieepedians of the Month for 2006.\n\n=====Content developments=====\n[[File:Firefox_screen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Wookieepedia's Main Page in Monobook Lite skin, August 2006]]\nWookieepedia welcomed its first bot on [[February 8]]. Maintained by Sikon, {{U|R2-D2}} was designed to clean up instances of repeating words, categories, as well as clean the [[Wookieepedia:Jundland Wastes|sandbox]] page. Since then, another bot named {{U|AL-BRT}}, maintained by {{U|Exiledjedi}}, has made {{Special:Editcount/AL-BRT}} total edits on Wookieepedia.<ref>{{Srlink|Special:Editcount/AL-BRT|AL-BRT edit count}}</ref>\n\nA new Forum area dubbed the {{Srlink|Forum:Senate Hall|Senate Hall}} was constructed in March 2006 as part of Wikia's MediaWiki updates, and as a result, the {{Srlink|Wookieepedia talk:Community Portal|Community Portal talk page}} was no longer the primary form of wikiwide discussion. Senate Hall was chosen as a name that would not be considered too clich\u00e9 or overly used for a ''Star Wars'' name. Consensus Track was subsequently moved into the forums, and becoming its own section, used specifically for policy creation and alteration on the wiki.\n\nThe [[Wookieepedia:WookieeProjects|WookieeProjects]] named [[Wookieepedia:WookieeProject Aliens|Aliens]], [[Wookieepedia:WookieeProject Images|Images]], the [[Wookieepedia:WookieeProject New Sith Wars|New Sith Wars]], and [[Wookieepedia:WookieeProject The New Essential Guide to Characters|''The New Essential Guide to Characters'']] were launched on [[June 6]], [[October 4]], [[October 28]], and [[November 1]], respectively.\n\n====2007====\n=====Community developments=====\n[[File:WookieeCast_logo.png|thumb|right|100px|WookieeCast logo]]\nOn [[February 20]], 2007, the first {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Wookiee-Cast|Wookiee-Cast}} was posted. The podcast was parody and commentary by Thefourdotelipsis on subjects relating to Wookieepedia and ''Star Wars'' in general. It did not, however, represent the official views of the wiki. The Wookiee-Cast podcasts were released throughout [[2007]], but the initial run never continued after that.\n\nOver the course of the spring leading up the 30th anniversary of ''Star Wars'', Wookieepedia held votes for the {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Coolest thing ever!|Coolest thing ever!}} and {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Lamest thing ever!|Lamest thing ever!}} with [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] and [[Fanon|SuperShadow]] winning respectively.\n\nIn May, at least ten Wookieepedians from across the globe attended [[Celebration IV]] to help monitor Wookieepedia's table alongside The Completely Unofficial Star Wars Encyclopedia founder [[Bob Vitas]], advertise the wiki, and host a trivia contest named \"Stump the Wookiee.\" In the months before the convention, admins and users came across a notice by [[Mary Franklin]] that a group could obtain a table at CIV for free. Immediately the wiki reacted and set up a page for those interested as well as other details of the event. By February, it was known that Wookieepedia won the table and final preparations were made.\n\n[[File:StumpTheWookiee.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A group of Wookieepedians after the Stump the Wookiee contest at Celebration IV]]\nSome users and administrators that attended and helped man the table alongside Vitas included Riffsyphon1024, Xwing328, jSarek, LtNOWIS, Ozzel, Graestan, {{U|Taybo20}}, Azizlight, Adamwankenobi, and Lord Hydronium. As a result of Wookieepedia's appearance and contest at Celebration IV, it was mentioned by the official site for the first time, marking another level of awareness in the ''Star Wars'' community. In addition, the event allowed the wiki to express itself to the fans directly.\n\nIn 2007, Imperialles and jSarek were made bureaucrats while Sikon lost his bureaucratship. Jaymach and Sentry also lost their adminship, but {{U|Atarumaster88}}, {{U|Green tentacle}}, {{U|Ozzel}}, {{U|Lord Hydronium}}, {{U|Havac}}, {{U|Greyman}}, {{U|Gonk}}, {{U|Thefourdotelipsis}}, {{U|Eyrezer}}, and {{U|Graestan}} were elected administrators. In addition, {{U|I need a name}}, {{U|Darth Oblivion}}, {{U|Enochf}}, {{U|Jorrel Fraajic}}, and {{U|AdmirableAckbar}} were vested [[Wookieepedia:Rollback|rollback]] privileges by the community.\n\nIn February, the [[Wookieepedia:Inquisitorius|Inquisitorius]] was formed to maintain the [[Wookieepedia:Featured articles|Featured article]] system. The first Inquisitors were Atarumaster88, Cull Tremayne, Darth Culator, Havac, Lord Hydronium, StarNeptune, Thefourdotelipsis, Breathesgelatin, Eyrezer, Jaina Solo, {{U|Tinwe}}, and Xwing328. Later in the year, they were joined by Imperialles, Gonk, Green tentacle, Greyman, Graestan, and {{U|Hobbes15}}. However, some meetings of the established user base included discriminatory behavior.<ref name=\"Wookpology\">{{WookCite|url=Wookieepedia:An_Apology_from_the_Administration_for_Wookieepedia's_Harmful_History?oldid=12163104|text=Wookieepedia:An Apology from the Administration for Wookieepedia's Harmful History}}</ref>\n\nWookieepedians of the Month for 2007 were Atarumaster88, {{U|Volemlock}}, {{U|Jaina Solo}}, Xwing328, Thefourdotelipsis, Enochf, {{U|Kuralyov}}, Eyrezer, Darth Culator, Greyman, I need a name, Cull Tremayne, AdmirableAckbar, and Green tentacle.\n\n=====Content developments=====\nWookieepedia's Reference desk became the new {{Srlink|Forum:Knowledge Bank|Knowledge Bank}} within the forums, where general questions on ''Star Wars'' not relating specifically to articles or Wookieepedia could be asked.\n\nThe wiki's Main Page underwent a major change, which allowed for exploration of the ''Star Wars'' universe within films, [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]], and in-universe categories to be hidden on a subpage with the use of Javascript. In addition, the single search icon in Wookieepedia's sidebar was upgraded in April to include {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Search icons|rotating search icons}}.\n\nIn May, the Votes for Deletion page was renamed to the more in-universe-sounding {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Trash compactor|Trash compactor}}.\n\nThe WookieeProjects [[Wookieepedia:WookieeProject Knights of the Old Republic|''Knights of the Old Republic'']] and [[Wookieepedia:WookieeProject Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] were launched on [[April 13]] and [[August 27]] respectively. One of the largest project undertaken by the community, the [[Wookieepedia:WookieeProject Images/ICP|Image Categorization Project (ICP)]] under WookieeProject Images, was created on [[October 21]].\n\n====2008====\n=====Community developments=====\nIn late February 2008, a Facebook fan page for Wookieepedia was started by Riffsyphon1024. It had over 67,000 fans in April 2014, but is now no longer maintained by Wookieepedians.\n\n=====Content developments=====\n[[File:Monaco_custom_sidebar_example.png|thumb|right|250px|Wookieepedia's Main Page in Monaco skin, February 2008]]\nWookieepedia began its {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Third anniversary media release|fourth year}} on March 4, [[2008]]. A new project of Wookieepedia was the {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Interviews|interview process}} with established authors, artists, actors, and anyone else related to the creation of the ''Star Wars'' universe in order to gain more insight for its articles. Some of Wookieepedia's first interviews were given to authors [[Kevin J. Anderson]] and [[Tom Veitch]] and artist [[Chris Gossett]].

Such was the case during what was described by some Wookieepedians as the \"Great List Purge\" that occurred in late December 2008 and early January [[2009]], where many old lists created years before were simply out of date as categories had accumulated a far greater number of articles on each topic.\n\nThe start of 2009 also saw the addition of an official blog to Wookieepedia, named the [http://wookieepedia.wordpress.com Wookieepedia Newsnet]. The blog began regular entries in January, with regular features summarizing monthly Featured Article output, Consensus Track results, Wookieepedian of the Month interviews, and Canon Updates.

phenomena====\n[[File:WookLogo-TamarJCanady.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fan-made Wookieepedia logo by Tamar J. Canady (used with permission)]]\nOver the course of the wiki's history, several attempts were made to curb [[fanon]] on user pages or delete it altogether. Most votes resulted in no consensus and the issue was pushed back until a few months later when it became known again. A major influence became the creation of the [[W:c:swfanon:Star Wars Fanon Wiki|Star Wars Fanon Wiki]], which was accepting of all forms of fanon written by its users. Most users on that wiki happened to be Wookieepedians as well, but would generally consist of members adding fanon to Wookieepedia. This shift of population was seen as general amounts of fanon reduced, but there still existed users that continued to add fanon content to Wookieepedia in contradiction with policy. This however did not limit the number of true contributors to Wookieepedia.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2019, an annual contest for {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Miss Star Wars 2019|Miss Star Wars}} and {{Srlink|Wookieepedia:Mister Star Wars 2019|Mister Star Wars}} had been held in December, with voting up to the new year. The winners, either male or female ''Star Wars'' characters, retain their crowns until the next vote and can continue to win as long as they receive enough support. The contests were then made into one, with [[Boba Fett]] becoming champion of Wookieepedia's [[Wookieepedia:Star Wars Character of the Year 2020|''Star Wars'' Character of the Year 2020]] contest.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, several Wookieepedians contributed to ''Star Wars'' canon via the [[What's The Story?]] feature of [[StarWars.com]], including [[John Hazlett]], [[Tim Veekhoven]], [[Aidan Hennessy]], [[Nathan O'Keefe]], [[Gregory Walker]], [[Kyle Jewhurst]], [[Timothy S.

    "plain_text": "mprot\nSteven \"Riffsyphon1024\" Greenwood]]\nWookieepedia:First anniversary media release\nWookieepedia: The Star Wars Wiki, or simply Wookieepedia, is a wiki that was launched on March 4, 2005 (as Star Wars Wiki), and strives to be the premier source of information on all aspects of the Star Wars universe. Maintained by volunteer editors, Wookieepedia documents content from the current Star Wars canon and the Star Wars Legends continuities, encompassing films, novels, games, and other media, as well as information of value to fans. Wookieepedia is inspired by Wikipedia, but expands on Star Wars information in greater detail and with more freedom than Wikipedia can. Since then, it has expanded to become one of the largest wikis on the Internet.\nAs a fan-made encyclopedia hosted by Fandom, Wookieepedia is not intended to be a primary source, nor is it a replacement for the Encyclopedia, the Databank, or any other official source. Rather, it serves as a fan effort to summarize all aspects of the Star Wars universe in the best way possible, while pointing the reader to the respective official sources.\n\n\u2022 History\n\n\u2022 The founding of Wookieepedia\n\n\u2022 Evolution of a wiki\n\nChad Barbry, first suggesting the name of the Star Wars' Wiki\nWikipedia (founded on January 15, 2001) is a collaboratively developed free content encyclopedia, covering a wide variety of topics, and has millions of articles.Wikipedia:About It is a general-knowledge encyclopedia, rather than being specific to one topic (as Wookieepedia is Star Wars&ndash;specific). Because of this, it is not always particularly friendly to in-depth knowledge specific to a given fictional universe.See Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:FancruftTalk:Star Wars/Archive 1#Star Wars Wiki (was Wikipedia Portal: StarWars ?)\nChad Barbry, under the screenname of \"Cbarbry,\" was a regular contributor to Wikipedia since October 17, 2004. User contributions for Cbarbry on Wikipedia So was Steven Greenwood, under the screenname of \"Riffsyphon1024,\" since January 5, 2005. User contributions for Riffsyphon1024 on Wikipedia Greenwood soon started sorting the various Star Wars articles on the site. As Wikipedia was concerned, only notable items would have complete articles, with the rest of the minor subjects with descriptions on a giant list. Planets, characters, weapons, and vehicles were all done in this manner. Over a short period of time, Greenwood found that he disliked this format and sought another way to gather and place information on the saga and its Expanded Universe.Riffsyphon1024s recollection of events On January 21, Greenwood posted on a section on a talk page regarding the creation of a new Star Wars Portal, but suggested that instead of a portal it should be a wiki, citing Halo Wiki (now Halopedia) as inspiration, as well as TheForce.nets Completely Unofficial Star Wars Encyclopedia.\nTwo days later, Chad Barbry entered the discussion, immediately coining the word \"Wookieepedia,\" Difference between revisions of \"Talk:Star Wars\" on Wikipedia while Greenwood proposed \"Wicketpedia\". Together they began working out ideas. Both agreed that this new project would run alongside Wikipedia as a separate, but equal entity&mdash;something more than simply a WikiProject. However, since Steven was not sure how a new wiki would be created, Barbry contacted Angela of then Wikicities (later Wikia, now Fandom) and requested the creation of the new wiki.\n\n\u2022 Wiki creation\n\nOther Wikipedia contributors seemed to be getting more hostile toward new Star Wars articles, so in February 2005, Barbry decided to make a request of the Wikipedia Board of Trustees to make a \"Star Wars Wiki.\" His intent was more than just another WikiProject, but an official sister project similar to Wikiquotes. He thought the best solution was a separate, but linked project&mdash;a project that was separate enough for the \"anti-cruft\" Wikipedians, but still one that was officially Wikipedia, so there would be no need for redundant articles between the projects.\nIn early March 2005, after meeting, the board came back with their answer. They did not want to move Wikipedia in the direction proposed by Barbry, but recommended creating a Star Wars Wikia. Angela of Wikia was on the Board of Trustees and contacted Barbry to let him know of the boards decision and to set up the new Star Wars Wiki.Chad Barbrys user page on Wookieepedia Part of the process that Angela set up was creating interwiki links so Wikipedia could link to Star Wars Wiki articles and vice versa.\nThe wiki came online on March 4, 2005, although it sat idle for a few days. Barbry, now under the screenname \"WhiteBoy,\" was the first non&ndash;Wikia staff user to officially edit the new wiki on March 10, starting with the moving of articles from Wikipedia to Star Wars Wiki space. Later that day, Greenwood joined the site, using his previous Wikipedia screenname.[ Riffsyphon1024s first edits] WhiteBoy was given bureaucrat rights by Wikia on the same day. A third Wikipedian edited that day as well, and was able to add some key image templates to the wiki, before leaving the project altogether.Special:Contributions/AlexTheMartian AlexTheMartians edits By the first few months, numbers of editors from both Wikipedia and across the web would dramatically increase.\nFor a brief time, there was some confusion as to how to move articles over from Wikipedia. Barbry devised a template for use on Wikipedia to place on talk pages of articles of interest, alerting users that the article would be redirected or moved entirely. The idea was to move as many existing articles from Wikipedia to the new wiki, under the GFDL, making sure to save those under threat of deletion first, and then \"wookify\" them to the new wiki's standards. The hope was that, though separate, Wikipedians would begin to put the more obscure articles (essentially anything but the most encyclopedic of articles) in the Star Wars Wiki. Main articles, such as Luke Skywalker, would remain at Wikipedia.\nWikipedians in general ultimately saw the Star Wars Wiki as an external site, one not affiliated with Wikipedia enough to actually \"transwiki\" articles over, like one would with Wikibooks or Wikirecipe. Creating redirects to the Star Wars Wiki was not what the Wikipedians had in mind, and they requested that Barbry and Greenwood immediately cease what they believed was legal transwikification;Riffsyphon1024s Archive 1 however, articles could still be copied and pasted under the GFDL copyleft license and then \"wookified\" to fit the scheme of the Star Wars&ndash;themed wiki, making sure to place an in-universe article in past tense, or remove redundant sentences. In this aspect, it was decided to have all' articles, not just those that were more trivial, lesser known, or more detailed, at the wiki.\nLater articles were copied in this fashion and the originals were left alone on Wikipedia for its users to edit under its rules. Eventually Wookieepedia would develop so many articles that Wikipedia would no longer have any to copy. It should also be noted that Wookieepedia was created independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and of any events occurring on Wikipedia.\n\n\u2022 Great LucasCruft Purge\n\nIn March of 2005, perhaps unaware of the formation of the new wiki, a Wikipedian (considered by some a deletionist who wished to prove a point) began to place several Star Wars articles in the Votes for Deletion system (now Articles for Deletion) in an attempt to get these articles deleted from Wikipedia. The purge was later dubbed the \"Great LucasCruft Purge\" by Greenwood himself.The term \"Great LucasCruft Purge\" stemmed from the VfD for Great Jedi Purge and was co-coined by Greenwood and Kappa. It was Greenwoods goal to save as many articles from this individual before the damage was made permanent, and would then impede Star Wars Wikis ability to grow as it did within the first month. One such article that became a focus of this battle was Order D6-66, which became one of the first stub articles added to the new wiki via the \"transwiki\" process. The purge garnered the Star Wars Wiki a great deal of public attention, which gave some the erroneous impression that Wookieepedia was created because of the purge.\n\n\u2022 By year\n\n\u2022 2005\n\n\u2022 Community developments\n\nJust days after the official founding, administrative powers were given to Greenwood (Riffsyphon1024) by Barbry (WhiteBoy). This set up the dual administrator system until the adminships of the users QuentinGeorge, Aidje, and SparqMan later in the year. Further on, StarNeptune, MarcK, and Imperialles were voted in as administrators in December.\nWookieepedian of the Month (WOTM) was first started in June 2005, with Imperialles as the first user to be recognized by the community for his contributions. Aidje, SparqMan, QuentinGeorge, JustinGann, MarcK, Azizlight, and Silly Dan were also awarded WOTM in 2005.Wookieepedia:Wookieepedian of the Month/History\n\n\u2022 Content developments\n\nThe wiki, now going under the moniker of \"Wookieepedia,\" developed a steady rate of contributions by new members from all over, and over time lost its reliance on Wikipedia. Eventually Wookieepedia became the primary name for the wiki and an official renaming took place with the creation of a new logo on January 8, 2006, by Tracy Duncan Dark Spork. It remains Wookieepedia's logo, with the user Tyber providing a version in higher resolution in 2014 and the user Master Fredcerique updating it in a Pride theme in 2023.\nJuly brought the first Quotes of the Day on Wookieepedia. The number of quotes later increased and passed through four subcategories, and QotD/In-Universe was the most edited page on Wookieepedia for a time. In the same month, Wookieepedias largest ever boost came when an explosion of editors hit the site, sending the wikis article count over 10,000. Factors to this expansion could be attributed to advertising and the release of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. By the end of the year, Wookieepedia's article count had surpassed 20,000. (See wiki growth table below.)\nIn September 2005, Did You Know? was created as an experiment and added to the Main Page, where it is now maintained as an active feature.\nThe Consensus Track, a voting and discussion system designed to improve site-wide policies and practices, was formed onto a single page in October 2005. In the same month, Eric Przybylski of Nav-Computer.com allowed Wookieepedia to use his fan-made sector maps on certain articles. His maps have since been replaced with versions taken directly from official sources.\n\n\u2022 2006\n\n\u2022 Community developments\n\njSarek, Azizlight, and Kuralyov were elected administrators in January. Also in January, Wookieepedia created a Memorial to Star Wars creators. Riffsyphon1024 was made bureaucrat in February, joining WhiteBoy. Jaymach, Silly Dan, and Darth Culator were elected admins in the first half of the year, while SFH, LtNOWIS, Sentry, Breathesgelatin, Xwing328, and Cull Tremayne became admins in the latter half. Sikon was elected bureaucrat in November.\nStarNeptune, Jack Nebulax, CooperTFN, Jaymach, Sikon, SFH, Rmfitzgerald50, Erik Pflueger, Sentry, Ozzel, LtNOWIS, and Borsk Fey'lya were Wookieepedians of the Month for 2006.\n\n\u2022 Content developments\n\nWookieepedia welcomed its first bot on February 8. Maintained by Sikon, R2-D2 was designed to clean up instances of repeating words, categories, as well as clean the sandbox page. Since then, another bot named AL-BRT, maintained by Exiledjedi, has made total edits on Wookieepedia.AL-BRT edit count\nA new Forum area dubbed the Senate Hall was constructed in March 2006 as part of Wikias MediaWiki updates, and as a result, the Community Portal talk page was no longer the primary form of wikiwide discussion. Senate Hall was chosen as a name that would not be considered too clich\u00e9 or overly used for a Star Wars' name. Consensus Track was subsequently moved into the forums, and becoming its own section, used specifically for policy creation and alteration on the wiki.\nThe WookieeProjects named Aliens, Images, the New Sith Wars, and The New Essential Guide to Characters were launched on June 6, October 4, October 28, and November 1, respectively.\n\n\u2022 2007\n\n\u2022 Community developments\n\nOn February 20, 2007, the first Wookiee-Cast was posted. The podcast was parody and commentary by Thefourdotelipsis on subjects relating to Wookieepedia and Star Wars in general. It did not, however, represent the official views of the wiki. The Wookiee-Cast podcasts were released throughout 2007, but the initial run never continued after that.\nOver the course of the spring leading up the 30th anniversary of Star Wars, Wookieepedia held votes for the Coolest thing ever! and Lamest thing ever! with Darth Vader and SuperShadow winning respectively.\nIn May, at least ten Wookieepedians from across the globe attended Celebration IV to help monitor Wookieepedia's table alongside The Completely Unofficial Star Wars Encyclopedia founder Bob Vitas, advertise the wiki, and host a trivia contest named \"Stump the Wookiee.\" In the months before the convention, admins and users came across a notice by Mary Franklin that a group could obtain a table at CIV for free. Immediately the wiki reacted and set up a page for those interested as well as other details of the event. By February, it was known that Wookieepedia won the table and final preparations were made.\nSome users and administrators that attended and helped man the table alongside Vitas included Riffsyphon1024, Xwing328, jSarek, LtNOWIS, Ozzel, Graestan, Taybo20, Azizlight, Adamwankenobi, and Lord Hydronium. As a result of Wookieepedias appearance and contest at Celebration IV, it was mentioned by the official site for the first time, marking another level of awareness in the Star Wars' community. In addition, the event allowed the wiki to express itself to the fans directly.\nIn 2007, Imperialles and jSarek were made bureaucrats while Sikon lost his bureaucratship. Jaymach and Sentry also lost their adminship, but Atarumaster88, Green tentacle, Ozzel, Lord Hydronium, Havac, Greyman, Gonk, Thefourdotelipsis, Eyrezer, and Graestan were elected administrators. In addition, I need a name, Darth Oblivion, Enochf, Jorrel Fraajic, and AdmirableAckbar were vested rollback privileges by the community.\nIn February, the Inquisitorius was formed to maintain the Featured article system. The first Inquisitors were Atarumaster88, Cull Tremayne, Darth Culator, Havac, Lord Hydronium, StarNeptune, Thefourdotelipsis, Breathesgelatin, Eyrezer, Jaina Solo, Tinwe, and Xwing328. Later in the year, they were joined by Imperialles, Gonk, Green tentacle, Greyman, Graestan, and Hobbes15. However, some meetings of the established user base included discriminatory behavior.\nWookieepedians of the Month for 2007 were Atarumaster88, Volemlock, Jaina Solo, Xwing328, Thefourdotelipsis, Enochf, Kuralyov, Eyrezer, Darth Culator, Greyman, I need a name, Cull Tremayne, AdmirableAckbar, and Green tentacle.\n\n\u2022 Content developments\n\nWookieepedias Reference desk became the new Knowledge Bank within the forums, where general questions on Star Wars' not relating specifically to articles or Wookieepedia could be asked.\nThe wikis Main Page underwent a major change, which allowed for exploration of the Star Wars universe within films, Expanded Universe, and in-universe categories to be hidden on a subpage with the use of Javascript. In addition, the single search icon in Wookieepedias sidebar was upgraded in April to include rotating search icons.\nIn May, the Votes for Deletion page was renamed to the more in-universe-sounding Trash compactor.\nThe WookieeProjects Knights of the Old Republic and Tales of the Jedi were launched on April 13 and August 27 respectively. One of the largest project undertaken by the community, the Image Categorization Project (ICP) under WookieeProject Images, was created on October 21.\n\n\u2022 2008\n\n\u2022 Community developments\n\nIn late February 2008, a Facebook fan page for Wookieepedia was started by Riffsyphon1024. It had over 67,000 fans in April 2014, but is now no longer maintained by Wookieepedians.\n\n\u2022 Content developments\n\nWookieepedia began its fourth year on March 4, 2008. A new project of Wookieepedia was the interview process with established authors, artists, actors, and anyone else related to the creation of the Star Wars universe in order to gain more insight for its articles. Some of Wookieepedia's first interviews were given to authors Kevin J. Anderson and Tom Veitch and artist Chris Gossett. This project, however, was short-lived in gaining access to interviewees.\nWookieeProjects Ewoks, Legacy Era, The Force Unleashed, and Ambition were launched on May 26, June 8, September 30, and November 21, respectively.\nBy August of 2008, the wiki had reached 60,000 articles.As noted per Interview request with Christian Gossett in August 2008, located at Wookieepedia:Interview/Christian Gossett.\n\n\u2022 2009\n\nAs with many wikis over time, certain features render other ones redundant or useless. Such was the case during what was described by some Wookieepedians as the \"Great List Purge\" that occurred in late December 2008 and early January 2009, where many old lists created years before were simply out of date as categories had accumulated a far greater number of articles on each topic.\nThe start of 2009 also saw the addition of an official blog to Wookieepedia, named the Wookieepedia Newsnet. The blog began regular entries in January, with regular features summarizing monthly Featured Article output, Consensus Track results, Wookieepedian of the Month interviews, and Canon Updates. An RSS feed for the blog was added to the Main Page on April 1st, 2009, with the blog receiving an impressive 1,072 hits on that day.\nWookieeProjects Real World Music, The Clone Wars, Galaxies, and Atlas were launched on April 13, April 14, June 13, and September 2, respectively.\n\n\u2022 2010\n\nJuly 2010 brought forth a new classification of article, partly inspired by Wikipedia practices. Improvement of minor articles and stubs would lead to the creation of comprehensive articles, those which were complete topics, but too small to be either Good Articles or Featured Articles.\nIn October 2010, Wookieepedia underwent another skin change by Wikia (see right).\nWookieeProjects Star Wars Encyclopedia, The Old Republic, and Astrography were launched in March, on April 22, and on May 16, respectively.\n\n\u2022 2011\n\nIn September 2011, an overhaul at StarWars.com resulted in a new Encyclopedia with every entry linking to a Wookieepedia article.\nBy November, the Senate Hall was altered to include listings for sticky threads, which would stick to the top of a separate list.\nWookieeProjects The New Jedi Order, Newsnet, and Video Games were launched on April 14, in June, and in July, respectively.\nWookieepedias First Barn Burner started in May, beginning with a focus on the sites titular subject: Wookiees. A second Barn Burner, held in August, focused on weapons, while Wookieepedias First Shed Scorcher: Dilonexa, began on October 22. The third Barn Burner, launched in December, focused on subjects relating to the film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace'.\n\n\u2022 2012\n\nWookieepedia attended a table at Celebration VI in Orlando, Florida and was interviewed by The Dork Night Podcast.\nIn February, the wiki surpassed 90,000 articles.\nWookieeProjects Warfare and Novels were launched on April 6 and August 22, respectively. The fourth Barn Burner, focused on droids, began in May, while the fifth Barn Burner began in November focusing on politics.\n\n\u2022 2013\n\nOn January 10, Wookieepedia surpassed 100,000 articles, with the creation of the article Jela Reneke. The sixth Barn Burner, held in May, focused on Hutts.\n\n\u2022 2014\n\nWith January came the seventh Barn Burner, with a focus on creatures of the Star Wars universe. WookieeProject Rebels' was launched on February 5.\nWith Lucasfilms announcement on April 25, 2014 to replace the Expanded Universe with the \"Legends\" brand, members of Wookieepedia subsequently discussed and voted to retain all information within Star Wars' media,Forum:CT:Legends and Canon coverage but split applicable articles into their respective canonical parts&mdash;Canon and Legends&mdash;with the use of tabs.Forum:CT:Tab system Editors on the site began creating new articles reflecting information only relevant to the new system of canon and by October 21 had created over 1000 in-universe canon articles.\nIn April, Cavalier One became the first user to be voted Wookieepedian of the Month for a second time.\n\n\u2022 2015\n\n\u2022 Community developments\n\nLeland Chee, on Wookieepedias 10th year in existence\nOn March 4, 2015, Wookieepedia celebrated the start of its 10th year. Several individuals with ties to Star Wars media, including Leland Chee and Jason Fry, congratulated the site on its birthday.Leland Chee\nWookieepedia was present at Celebration Anaheim (April 16&ndash;April 19), where the wiki shared table space with Wikia and hosted a birthday party with a Wookieepedia cake. Afterward, Wikia hosted the Qwizards panel, which allowed fans to compete against long-time Wookieepedians jSarek, Cavalier One, and Jorrel Fraajic.\n\n\u2022 Content developments\n\nWikia introduced the Discussions forum feature to Wookieepedia in November, with its first thread being posted on November 12.\nOn the heels of the 2014 decision to institute a tabbed system for canon and Legends content, Wookieepedia editors decided in December 2015 to begin presenting canon content on primary pages, such that visitors arriving at pages such as \"Luke Skywalker\" would find content relevant to the new canon continuity rather than Legends material. The new system was instituted shortly before the premiere of the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, assuring that those arriving in search of details of classic elements appearing in the new films would easily find the relevant information.Wookieepedia Consensus Track - Canon/Legends Default SwitchMofference - December 7, 2015\n\n\u2022 2018\n\narticle in Oasis skin, March 2017]]\nWookieeProject Battlefront was set up on July 30, 2018.\n\n\u2022 2019\n\nWookieeProjects Resistance and Galaxys Edge were launched on April 9 and September 9, respectively.\n\n\u2022 2020\n\n\u2022 Community developments\n\nZed42 and Spookywilloww were granted rollback in March, while 01miki10 and OOM 224 were granted the tool in November and December, respectively. Exiledjedi resigned from his adminship in May, while AnilSerifoglu resigned from all his positions in October. Master Fredcerique and Zed42 were then elected administrators in the latter half of the year.\nIn April, Wookieepedia's Discord server was opened up to limited access for Wookieepedians, facilitating communications and furthering collaboration. The server was made official in June.\nWookieepedias first Star Wars Character of the Year tournament was held, replacing the annual Mister/Miss Star Wars votes. Wookieepedias first Artist of the Year and Newcomer of the Year votes were also held, with Dave Filoni and Clone Force 99 \"The Bad Batch\" as winners for the respective competitions.\n\n\u2022 Content developments\n\nWookieeProjects Mandalore and The Mandalorian were launched on January 29 and February 3, respectively.\nProject Stardust was launched by Master Fredcerique as a collaborative effort to improve articles on essential topics. It was a successful launch, with significant expansions to the Ahsoka Tano and Mustafar articles between May and August.\nThe backup link project, organized by UberSoldat93, NanoLuuke, and Xd1358 among others, provided tens of thousands of archival links throughout the wiki, ensuring that information found online would not be lost. Pages listed in the relevant maintenance category dropped from over 22,000 to a grand total of zero in the course of just over seven months.\nOn September 2, Wookieepedia surpassed 160,000 articles.\n\n\u2022 2021\n\n\u2022 Community developments\n\nThe character Boba Fett was crowned the Star Wars Character of the Year for 2020, with runners-up being Din Djarin, Yarael Poof, Frog Lady, and Ahsoka Tano.\nJediMasterMacaroni was chosen as the new year's first Wookieepedian of the Month for his outstanding contributions to both the community and the wiki. On January 19, the Padawan editing tutorial was completed by Master Fredcerique, allowing new editors to learn the basics of the editing. The Glossary of Wookieepedian terms saw a major update by Xd1358 on January 31.\nHanzo Hasashi was voted in as Februarys Wookieepedian of the Month for his status article work, becoming a two-time winner for the award. On February 5, Lewisr was awarded the editor of the year in Fandoms Movies/TV wiki category in 2020, as well being recognized for having made the most edits in the same category. Grunny resigned his bureaucratship on February 17. On February 24, VergenceScatter was granted rollback rights by the community. The final Mofference was held on February 27, and Tommy-Macaroni was elected bureaucrat on March 4, coinciding with Wookieepedia's sixteenth anniversary. Wok142 won the Wookieepedian of the Month award in March for his clean-up and anti-vandalism work, as well as article expansions and contributions to Discord discussions.\nImmi Thrax was awarded Wookieepedian of the Month for April for her friendly attitude and involvement in community discussions, as well as exemplary work on oft-neglected topics. In the aftermath of Marchs Consensus Track vote that was nullified by a Fandom decision, bureaucrats Darth Culator and Toprawa and Ralltiir were banned for propagating a toxic culture on the site over many years with the involvement of other editors, and Wookieepedias Facebook account was discontinued.\nLater in April, the Knowledge Bank feature on the wiki was retired and replaced by a forum thread on Discussions. In the same month, Plume Tray launched his own bot, PLUMEBOT, and DwartiiDelver was awarded May's Wookieepedian of the Month for quality status article nominations and contributions to discussions. In addition, Master Fredcerique and Xd1358 were elected bureaucrats on May 4, and on May 22, Shayanomer was admitted to the AgriCorps reviewing panel. The Mofference was also retired in favor of the on-site Consensus Track, while the organized real-time spirit of the Mofference was continued through the WookieeNights event, unofficially launched by Supreme Emperor in May and ratified in July.\nPlume Tray was awarded Wookieepedian of the Month for June for his botwork with PLUMEBOT and contributions to numerous templates using his technical expertise.

That same day, Fandom named Immi Thrax their editor of the month for June in the TV/Movies category of wikis for her contributions to Wookieepedias LGBTQIA+ coverage. Wookieepedias Twitter account was verified on July 7, and on July 8, Cade Calrayn launched JocastaBot, a bot designed to handle part of the Comprehensive article, Good article, and Featured article nomination archival process for review panel members.\nNewcomer YakovChaimTzvi won Wookieepedian of the Month for August for greatly improving coverage on the Star Wars: The Ascendancy Trilogy novels and other Chiss-related material.

Most users on that wiki happened to be Wookieepedians as well, but would generally consist of members adding fanon to Wookieepedia.

A question on the TFN Boards in 2008 asked whether the wiki continued to be reliable, to which jSarek replied, \"To a degree. We generally keep the nonsense out, but were not perfect, and sometimes something slips through.\" Vandalism can easily distort canonical information if not checked; however, with Wookieepedia being one of the most active wikis, vandalism going unnoticed is rare. Fandom released an apology to Newsweek after racist edits were noticed by fans visiting Rose Ticos page.\n\n\u2022 Influences on canon\n\n\u2022 Jedi Exile &mdash; \"Jedi Exile\" began as a fanon nickname for this nameless character (called just \"exile\" in the game dialogue), but was adopted in The New Essential Guide to Droids.\n\n\u2022 Wookieepedias conjectural term \"Sith Triumvirate\" was canonized by the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide'.\n\n\u2022 Padawan Massacre &mdash; The event was first called \"Padawan Massacre of Taris\" on Wookieepedia for lack of an official term.

This screenshot was later printed in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, making the name canon for several years. But in November 2011, the publication of The Old Republic: Revan clarified that the Exile's name is actually Meetra Surik.\n\n\u2022 In 2006, during the early days of Wookieepedia where less oversight existed, a Wookieepedia editor going by the name Doran added fan translations to the pages of several Mandalorian leaders, roughly attempting to render their names in the Mando'a language. The fanon translations managed to remain up on Wookieepedia and spread across the Mandalorian fandom as if they were confirmed; the alleged Mandoa title of Mandalore the Ultimate, for example, was written and then spread as \"Te Anila Mandalor\" as if it was official. This culminated in the 2017 canon reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia naming a type of Mandalorian tree the trees of Te Anila,Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia thereby canonizing part of the Mandoa name for the Ultimate once coined by Doran for wiki aesthetic value. Once brought to the attention of current Wookieepedia editors, the fan-translated name on Mandalore the Ultimate's page was removed due to its basis in speculation, but the tree of Te Anila' page remains due to its canonical citation.\n\n\u2022 Cloud-Riders &mdash; Jon Kasdan, writer of Solo: A Star Wars Story, found the Star Wars Legends Cloud-Riders when browsing Wookieepedia and the name stuck.Jon Kasdan\n\n\u2022 631 model B1 battle droid was a conjectural title for the 631 model of B1-series battle droids despite a non-conjectural title being available, but the fifty-sixth issue of De Agostinis Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon' magazine canonized the name nonetheless.\n\n\u2022 As a joke on Wookieepedia titling the article for the first Sith in the new Star Wars canon as \"unidentified rogue Jedi,\" author Jack Mitchell referred to the character as \"the nameless founder\" in The Odyssey of Star Wars: An Epic Poem, published in 2021.\n\n\u2022 In other languages\n\nList of Star Wars Wikis in other languages\nIn addition to Wookieepedia, several other Star Wars wikis exist in multiple languages. These different language encyclopedias were started and are currently run by different people.\n\n\u2022 Spin-offs\n\nSeveral wikis have been spawned from Wookieepedia. These include the Star Wars Fanon Wiki, the Star Wars Games Wiki, the LEGO Star Wars Wiki, the Star Wars Fanpedia, the Clone Wars Wiki, the Clone Wars Adventures Wiki, the Star Wars: The Old Republic Wiki, and the Star Wars Rebels Wiki.\nIn addition, the site wookieepedia.org appears to be written entirely in Shyriiwook.\n\n\u2022 Notes and references\n\n\u2022 External links\n\n\u2022 Wookieepedia\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022",
