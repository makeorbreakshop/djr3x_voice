TIMBRE: Significant timbre differences detected. Consider adding robot-like effects such as ring modulation, comb filtering with longer delay times (5-10ms), or formant shifting.


GENERAL: Current comb filter delay (0.5ms) is likely too short for a robot effect. Try increasing to 5-10ms and adjusting feedback.

GENERAL: Consider adding ring modulation (50-100Hz carrier frequency) for a more synthetic character.

GENERAL: Try experimenting with effect ordering - place modulation effects before/after distortion to find the optimal chain.
