# CantinaOS Event Bus Redesign: Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

### Core Event Bus Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Replace current async registration with synchronous guarantees
- [x] Create `SyncEventBus` class that extends current `EventBus` class
- [x] Implement `sync_on(topic, handler)` method for test compatibility
- [x] Add internal registration tracking with verification mechanism
- [x] Create robust handler registry in EventBus
- [x] Implement proper handler lifecycle management
- [x] Improve error handling to allow handlers to execute even when one fails
- [x] Add per-handler timeout handling with configurable timeouts
- [x] Fix threading and concurrency issues
- [x] Implement proper Pydantic model conversion for payloads

### Testing Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Create unit tests for SyncEventBus with verification
- [x] Test handler registration and removal
- [x] Test error handling scenarios
- [x] Test concurrent event handling
- [x] Test payload conversion (dict, Pydantic models)
- [x] Ensure all unit tests pass consistently

### Integration Test Fixes ✅
- [x] Fix timeout issue waiting for `mode/transition/started` event
- [x] Address error propagation behavior mismatch in integration tests
- [x] Fix service shutdown event issues
- [x] Increase grace periods for event propagation
- [x] Implement better subscription verification

### YodaModeManagerService Updates ✅
- [x] Ensure mode transitions wait for subscription completion
- [x] Add explicit sequence management for transition events
- [x] Implement transaction-like event emission for related events
- [x] Fix event emission timing in mode transitions
- [x] Add better error handling in mode transitions

### Improve Handler Cleanup Mechanism ✅
- [x] Fix "unhashable type: 'SubscriptionInfo'" errors during cleanup
- [x] Improve handler identity tracking for proper cleanup
- [x] Enhance handler cleanup during service shutdown
- [x] Add monitoring for potential memory leaks

## Remaining Tasks (Prioritized)

### 1. End-to-End Testing ⏳
- [ ] Create end-to-end integration tests
- [ ] Verify timing behavior with all services running
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Test concurrent operations
- [ ] Validate long-running stability

## Success Criteria

The redesign will be considered complete when:
1. [x] All unit and integration tests pass consistently (100% success rate)
2. [x] No timeout errors occur in EventSynchronizer
3. [x] No "handler not found" warnings during cleanup
4. [x] Events are processed in the correct order
5. [x] Service status transitions occur properly
6. [ ] No memory leaks in long-running scenarios

## Key Learnings and Solutions

1. **Event Order and Timing Issues**
   - Root cause: Events were being emitted before handlers were registered
   - Solution: Added proper sequencing with `TransactionContext` and ensured handlers are registered before events are emitted

2. **Subscription Verification**
   - Root cause: No mechanism to verify subscriptions were active before events were emitted
   - Solution: Added explicit subscription verification method with timeouts

3. **Error Propagation Control**
   - Root cause: Inconsistent error handling behavior
   - Solution: Added configurable `propagate_errors` flag to control whether errors from handlers are propagated

4. **Handler Cleanup Issues**
   - Root cause: Using complex objects directly in handler registry
   - Solution: Improved handler registry structure with better tracking and identity management

5. **Test Sequencing**
   - Root cause: Tests were not properly sequencing service startup and event subscriptions
   - Solution: Updated test patterns to ensure proper subscription registration before service startup

## Next Actions

1. Focus on end-to-end testing:
   - Create comprehensive end-to-end tests that simulate real-world usage
   - Ensure all services can interact correctly in a long-running scenario

2. Monitor memory usage:
   - Implement memory usage monitoring to detect potential leaks
   - Test long-running scenarios to ensure proper resource cleanup
