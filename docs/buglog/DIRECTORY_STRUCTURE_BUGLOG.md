# CantinaOS Directory Structure Bug Log

## Issue Summary
**Severity**: Critical (Blocking)  
**Component**: Core Package Structure  
**Discovered**: 2025-05-08  
**Status**: Identified, Solution Pending

## Problem Description
During the initial test execution phase of the CantinaOS implementation, critical directory structure inconsistencies were discovered that are preventing tests from running successfully. The codebase contains duplicate implementations in different locations with inconsistent import paths, leading to fundamental import errors and confusion about the correct codebase organization.

## Technical Analysis

### Directory Structure Issues

1. **Duplicate Code Paths**
   - Primary implementations exist in: `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/`
   - Duplicate implementations exist in: `cantina_os/src/services/`
   - Example: Two different versions of `mic_input_service.py` with different class implementations

2. **Import Path Confusion**
   - Tests are importing from `src.services` but accessing classes that only exist in `cantina_os.services`
   - Error example: `ImportError: cannot import name 'AudioConfig' from 'src.services.mic_input_service'`
   - The `AudioConfig` class exists in `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/mic_input_service.py` but not in `cantina_os/src/services/mic_input_service.py`

3. **Nested Package Structure**
   - Unusual nested structure: `cantina_os/cantina_os/`
   - Creates ambiguity in Python's import resolution
   - Leads to confusion about the correct import paths

4. **Package Installation Problems**
   - Package not installed in development mode
   - `setup.py` might not reference the correct package structure
   - Tests cannot find modules through standard import mechanisms

### Example of Conflicting Implementations

**In `cantina_os/src/services/mic_input_service.py`:**
```python
class MicInputService(BaseService):
    """Service for capturing audio input from microphone."""
    
    def __init__(self, event_bus):
        super().__init__(event_bus)
        self.stream: Optional[sd.InputStream] = None
        self.sample_rate = 16000
        self.channels = 1
        self._loop: Optional[asyncio.AbstractEventLoop] = None
```

**In `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/mic_input_service.py`:**
```python
@dataclass
class AudioConfig:
    """Configuration for audio capture."""
    device_index: int
    sample_rate: int = 16000
    channels: int = 1
    dtype: np.dtype = np.int16
    blocksize: int = 1024  # Samples per block
    latency: float = 0.1   # Device latency in seconds

class AudioChunkPayload(BaseEventPayload):
    """Payload for raw audio chunk events."""
    samples: bytes  # Raw audio samples as bytes
    timestamp: float  # Capture timestamp
    sample_rate: int  # Sample rate in Hz
    channels: int  # Number of channels
    dtype: str  # NumPy dtype string

class MicInputService(BaseService):
    # More complete implementation...
```

**Test Import (using incorrect path):**
```python
from src.services.mic_input_service import MicInputService, AudioConfig, AudioChunkPayload
```

## Proposed Solution

### Immediate Actions

1. **Standardize Directory Structure**
   - Choose `cantina_os/cantina_os/` as the primary codebase location
   - Remove or archive `cantina_os/src/` to prevent confusion

2. **Fix Package Installation**
   ```bash
   # From the cantina_os directory
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Update setup.py**
   ```python
   from setuptools import setup, find_packages

   setup(
       name="cantina_os",
       version="0.1.0",
       packages=find_packages(),
       # Add other metadata as needed
   )
   ```

4. **Update Test Imports**
   - Change from:
     ```python
     from src.services.mic_input_service import MicInputService, AudioConfig
     ```
   - To:
     ```python
     from cantina_os.services.mic_input_service import MicInputService, AudioConfig
     ```

5. **Update pytest.ini**
   ```ini
   [pytest]
   pythonpath = .
   testpaths = tests
   python_files = test_*.py
   asyncio_mode = auto
   ```

### Long-term Recommendations

1. **Package Structure Documentation**
   - Add clear documentation about package structure in README.md
   - Include import examples and package installation instructions

2. **Import Conventions**
   - Establish consistent import patterns across the codebase
   - Use absolute imports from the package root
   - Avoid relative imports except for closely related modules

3. **Directory Structure Guidelines**
   - Eliminate nested package directories with the same name
   - Follow standard Python package layout conventions
   - Consider using a src-layout for cleaner separation

4. **Integrated CI Checks**
   - Add import validity checks to CI pipeline
   - Implement linting for import statements
   - Run package installation tests before test execution

## Validation Plan

After implementing the changes, we should:

1. Run `pip install -e .` to install the package in development mode
2. Verify imports work in a Python interpreter:
   ```python
   from cantina_os.services.mic_input_service import MicInputService, AudioConfig
   ```
3. Run the previously failing tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/unit/test_mic_input_service.py -v
   ```
4. Document the correct structure in the dev log and project README

## Expected Outcome

After these changes, the testing framework should be able to correctly locate and import all modules, allowing the systematic test execution phase to proceed. This will establish a consistent project structure that will prevent similar issues in the future and provide a solid foundation for ongoing development. 

## Update 2025-05-08: Implementation of Directory Structure Fix

The following actions have been taken to address the directory structure issues:

1. **Standardized on Primary Codebase Location**:
   - Confirmed `cantina_os/cantina_os/` as the primary location for all code
   - Created backup of `src` content in `_archive/src_backup`
   - Removed `src` directory to eliminate confusion

2. **Fixed Package Installation**:
   - Ran `pip install -e .` to install the package in development mode
   - Verified the package is now properly discoverable by Python

3. **Updated Import Statements**:
   - Changed imports in `simple_test.py` from `src.services.mic_input_service` to `cantina_os.services.mic_input_service`
   - Updated test files in `tests/unit/test_mic_input_service.py` and `tests/integration/test_mic_integration.py`
   - Updated `tests/conftest.py` to import from `cantina_os` package
   - Fixed imports in mock services

4. **Added Missing Schema Classes**:
   - Added missing `ModeTransitionStartedPayload` and `ModeChangedPayload` classes to `cantina_os/event_payloads.py`

Initial tests show improved import resolution, though some implementation issues in the event bus remain that will require separate fixes. The core directory structure issue has been addressed, allowing systematic testing to proceed.

Next steps will focus on running the full test suite and fixing any remaining implementation issues that were masked by the directory structure problems.
