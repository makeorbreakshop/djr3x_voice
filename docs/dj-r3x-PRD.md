Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project: DJ Rex Voice-Only Demo (Mac Desktop MVP)Owner: Brandon CullumDraft Date: May 2, 2025

1. Purpose & Vision

Build a 100% voice-first "mini-assistant" that listens, thinks, and speaks back in a custom DJ Rex-inspired voice. The demo will run entirely on a Mac (no moving hardware) and serve as the foundation for a future full-droid build.

Vision: Create a friendly, slightly quirky Star Wars-themed assistant prototype that can capture live speech, convert it to text, generate a conversational reply, and output that reply through a custom text-to-speech voice.

2. Problem Statement

Current smart assistants lack:

Star Wars personality and customization.

Easy integration with hobbyist Python stacks.

Transferability to robotics platforms.

3. Goals & Success Metrics

Goal

Metric

End-to-end voice conversation works locally

Responds < 3s round-trip for < 15-word query

Uses custom ElevenLabs voice

Synthesized audio is clearly non-generic

Setup time

< 1 hour on clean Mac

4. Scope

4.1 In-Scope (MVP)

CLI interface (python rex_talk.py).

Push-to-talk (press Enter to talk).

Speech-to-text (Google Web Speech API).

Chat response (OpenAI ChatCompletion).

Text-to-speech (generic ElevenLabs voice).

Basic terminal logging.

4.2 Out-of-Scope (Future Phases)

Wake-word activation.

LED mouth bar sync.

Physical interface.

Offline large-model inference.

ROS 2 integration.

5. Personas & User Stories

Persona

User Story

Maker Brandon

"As a builder, I want to install a simple script and verify two-way voice in < 1 hour so I can demo it before work."

Future Fan

"As a Star Wars fan, I want replies in DJ Rex's tone so the experience feels authentic."

6. Functional Requirements

ID

Requirement

Acceptance Criteria

F-1

Capture microphone input on command

F-2

Convert speech to text

95%+ accuracy in quiet room

F-3

Generate chat response

OpenAI API returns valid reply

F-4

Synthesize reply with ElevenLabs voice

Audio playback uses ElevenLabs voice

F-5

Round-trip latency

â‰¤ 3s for < 15-word exchange

F-6

Error handling

Descriptive errors, no script crashes

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Category

Requirement

Performance

< 3s end-to-end latency

Reliability

Graceful retry on API timeouts (max 2 retries)

Privacy

Audio not stored unless debugging

Maintainability

Environment keys loaded from .env or shell exports

Portability

Runs on macOS 13+ with Python â‰¥ 3.11

8. Interaction & UX

CLI Flow (MVP)

$ python rex_talk.py
ðŸŽ§ Press ENTER to talk â†’ speak into mic
[Silence detected] â†’ "You: <transcript>"
ðŸ¤– Rex responds (printed)
ðŸ”Š Rex voice plays via system speakers
(loop)

Future Interaction

Wake-word activation.

LED sync.

ROS 2 service integration.

9. Technical Architecture (MVP)

[Mic] â†’ SpeechRecognition (Google STT)
â†’ OpenAI ChatCompletion (GPT)
â†’ ElevenLabs TTS (custom voice)
â†’ Mac speakers

Language: Python 3.11

Packages: speech_recognition, pyaudio, openai, elevenlabs

Config: Environment variables for API keys and voice ID

10. Dependencies & Risks

Risk

Mitigation

Network outage

Fallback error message

API limits

Use free tier cautiously, consider paid tier if needed

Key leakage

Load from environment, never commit keys

11. MVP Timeline (â‰ˆ 90 min)

Time

Task

0â€“15 min

Install dependencies

15â€“25 min

ElevenLabs voice creation

25â€“45 min

Write rex_talk.py skeleton

45â€“60 min

Error handling and logging

60â€“70 min

Latency testing

70â€“85 min

Polish persona prompt

85â€“90 min

Final test run

12. Future Iterations

Wake-word detection.

LED sync for mouth movement.

Offline Whisper for STT.

Local GPT inference.

ROS 2 node integration.

Intent-to-action hooks.

13. Web Interface (Frontend)

13.1 Confirmed Design Outline

Interaction:
- Push to talk button â†’ starts listening.
- Auto playback of Rex reply (no user click required).
- Text transcript: both user speech and Rex response shown.

UI:
- Star Wars / Cantina-themed â†’ using Tailwind for base + custom styling.
- Star Wars-style speaker panel animation during Rex reply playback.

User:
- Single-user.
- Local run only (no auth or backend user management yet).

Tech:
- React / NextJS
- TailwindUI / Shadcn for base components.
- ElevenLabs audio playback.
- Web Speech API for STT via backend.

13.2 Architecture

[User Voice] â†’ (Push-to-Talk Button) â†’ Microphone Access (Web Audio API)
              â†’ Stream to local Python backend (current setup)
              â†’ STT â†’ GPT â†’ ElevenLabs Audio
              â†’ Send audio + transcript back to frontend
              â†’ Auto playback + text display
              â†’ Visualizer (speaker panel animation)

13.3 Frontend Component Map

Component | Role
--------- | ----
MicButton | Starts/stops audio capture
TranscriptDisplay | Shows user speech + Rex reply
AudioPlayer | Auto-plays response audio
VisualizerPanel | Star Wars style animated speaker graphic
MainLayout | Arranges components, handles push-to-talk logic

13.4 Data Flow (Frontend)

1. User clicks "Talk"
2. Browser captures mic audio
3. Audio sent to local backend
4. Backend returns transcript + audio
5. Frontend displays text + plays audio
6. Visualizer animates while audio plays

13.5 Technical Implementation

Task | Implementation
---- | -------------
Audio capture | getUserMedia API
Audio transfer | REST POST with FormData WAV blob
Audio playback | <audio> tag or Howler.js
Visualizer | CSS animation or Canvas API tied to AudioContext
API calls | fetch or Axios
Browser compatibility | Desktop Chrome only

Final Note

STT: Google Web Speech chosen for MVP simplicity and speed.TTS: ElevenLabs generic voice for now.Push-to-talk: Confirmed as acceptable for MVP.No hardware integration in this version.

Ready to proceed to script creation.
