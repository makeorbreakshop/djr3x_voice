## Usage Guidelines

1. **Prompt Influence Settings**:
   - Higher values (0.8-0.9) for mechanical/electronic sounds
   - Medium values (0.6-0.7) for ambient/atmospheric sounds
   - Lower values (0.4-0.5) for musical elements that need variation

2. **Duration Guidelines**:
   - Short effects (0.3-0.8s) for UI and reaction sounds
   - Medium effects (1.0-2.0s) for movement and transitions
   - Long effects (4.0-8.0s) for ambient and musical loops

3. **Mixing Considerations**:
   - Ambient sounds should be mixed at lower volumes
   - UI/System sounds should be clear but not dominant
   - Musical elements should duck under speech
   - Droid sounds should be prominent during interactions

4. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Cache all effects after generation
   - Use consistent file naming: `category_name_duration.mp3`
   - Store metadata (duration, category, description) in JSON
   - Implement volume control per category
