## Progress Notes
### 2025-05-10
1. Completed Version Standardization:
   - Pinned Supabase to 2.3.5 in all dependency files
   - Added version documentation to README.md
   - No other dependency files found referencing Supabase

2. Completed Centralized Client Factory:
   - Created `holocron/database/client_factory.py` with:
     - Singleton pattern implementation
     - Version detection and validation
     - Connection pooling (max 5 connections)
     - Retry logic with exponential backoff
     - Comprehensive error handling
   - Created `tests/test_supabase_client_factory.py` with full test coverage
   - Set up proper package structure with `__init__.py`

3. Completed Test Suite Implementation:
   - Fixed duplicate mock_client fixture
   - Updated vector search method names to match current API
   - Added missing content_tokens field to mock responses
   - Removed URL-related tests for non-existent functionality
   - Added comprehensive transaction tests:
     - Basic transaction success
     - Transaction rollback on error
     - Nested transaction support
     - Transactions with vector search operations
   - Added proper error handling tests
   - Added connection pooling tests
   - Added batch operation tests

### 2025-05-13
1. Identified Issues in Test Suite:
   - Marked several test execution points incorrectly as complete
   - Need to run the following tests:
     - Holocron Database Integration Tests
     - Vector search capabilities testing
     - Database functionality verification
     - Semantic relevance testing with expected terms
   - Additional test files identified for regression testing:
     - `test_holocron_pipeline.py`
     - `test_holocron_chat.py`
     - `test_holocron_batch_pipeline.py`

2. Next Action Items:
