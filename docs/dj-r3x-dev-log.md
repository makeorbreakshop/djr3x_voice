### 2025-05-06: Event Bus Architecture Investigation
- Investigated error: "RuntimeError: no running event loop" when using push-to-talk mode
- Confirmed event bus architecture is the right approach for coordinating multiple hardware components
- Discovered key issue: synchronous keyboard listener (pynput) cannot directly interact with asyncio event loop
- Need to implement proper "bridge" between synchronous threads and asyncio using thread-safe methods
- Architecture insight: The event bus design is sound for our multi-component system, but requires careful handling of cross-thread communication
- Approach: Use asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe() or loop.call_soon_threadsafe() to properly schedule events from synchronous contexts

### 2025-05-06: Event Bus Async Handler Fix
- Enhanced EventBus to properly handle mixed sync/async event handlers with task gathering
- Fixed LED animation timing issues by properly awaiting async event handlers 

### 2025-05-06: LED Configuration Update
- Centralized LED settings in `app_settings.py` with macOS-compatible defaults 

### 2025-05-06: Push-to-Talk Event Loop Reference Fix
- Fixed critical error: "Task got Future <_GatheringFuture pending> attached to a different loop"
- Root cause: Event loop reference mismatch between initialization and execution phases
- Problem detail: VoiceManager captures event loop with `asyncio.get_event_loop()` during init, but `asyncio.run()` in main.py creates a new loop
- When keyboard listener thread uses `run_coroutine_threadsafe()`, it references wrong loop
- Solution: Pass the running event loop explicitly from main.py to VoiceManager, ensuring consistent loop references
- Learning: When using asyncio with threaded callbacks, always capture the running loop explicitly with `asyncio.get_running_loop()` and pass it to components requiring cross-thread communication 

### 2025-05-06: Voice Interaction Pipeline Investigation
- Fixed OpenAI integration by storing model name directly in VoiceManager instance instead of config dictionary

- Commands: `ambient`, `engage`, `disengage` (returns to IDLE)
- Improved LED patterns for each mode and fixed command input display

### 2025-05-06: Voice Interaction and LED State Management Updates
- Fixed VoiceManager interaction loop for speech synthesis/playback
- Known Issue: LED transitions during pattern interruption need improvement 

### 2025-05-06: Music Playback System Design
- Implemented CLI music controls: `list music`, `play music <number/name>`, `stop music`
- Mode-specific behaviors:
  - IDLE: Limited controls; playing transitions to AMBIENT
  - AMBIENT: Full controls, continuous playback
  - INTERACTIVE: Full controls with audio ducking during speech
- Architecture: MusicManager listens for control commands and mode changes
- Next steps: CLI implementation, testing, voice command integration

### 2025-05-06: Asyncio State Transition Fix

- Solutions: Task cancellation, non-blocking I/O, resource cleanup
- Result: Clean transitions between system modes 

### 2025-05-06: Added System Reset Command

- Implementation:
  - Cancels all active tasks (voice, LED, music)
  - Cleans up hardware connections (Arduino, audio)
  - Forces transition to IDLE mode
  - Re-initializes core managers if needed
- Benefit: Quick recovery from stuck states without full restart 

### 2025-05-06: Streaming Voice Pipeline Research & Implementation
- Goal: Replace batch voice pipeline (Whisper ‚Üí GPT ‚Üí ElevenLabs) with streaming architecture
- Target: Mic ‚Üí Deepgram ASR ‚Üí GPT-4o ‚Üí Eleven Labs TTS ‚Üí Playback
- Expected latency reduction: 3-5s ‚Üí 1-1.5s
- Implementation phases:
  1. Deepgram streaming ASR (100ms chunks)
  2. GPT-4o streaming
  3. Streaming TTS evaluation
- Key architecture decisions:
  - Push-to-talk integration with streaming sessions
  - Streaming state machine with 300ms stability window
  - Task management for each streaming component
  - Mode-based connection lifecycle

### 2025-05-07: Streaming Voice Pipeline Progress

  - Updated event handling between components
  - Maintained compatibility with original audio capture
- Verified full pipeline: Audio ‚Üí Deepgram ‚Üí GPT ‚Üí ElevenLabs ‚Üí Playback
- Next: Latency optimization and streaming parameter tuning

### 2025-05-06: Streaming Voice Processing Pipeline Integration
- Fixed critical import errors in the Deepgram SDK integration:
  - Updated `deepgram-sdk` from `2.11.0` to `4.0.0` in requirements.txt to resolve `DeepgramClient` import errors
  - Fixed `LiveTranscriptionEvents` import by updating path from `deepgram.clients.listen.v1` to `deepgram.clients.listen`
- Root cause: The Deepgram Python SDK underwent significant API changes between v2 and v4
- Also updated the `python-vlc` package from `3.0.20000` to `3.0.21203` to resolve compatibility issues
- Implementation insight: Always check API documentation when upgrading major versions of SDKs, as import paths and class structures often change
- This enables the planned streaming voice processing pipeline with reduced latency versus previous Whisper-based speech recognition 

### 2025-05-06: Deepgram SDK v4.0.0 Callback Signature Fix
- Fixed critical WebSocket errors occurring in StreamManager with Deepgram SDK v4.0.0
- Issue: SDK v4.0.0 expects a different callback signature pattern than our implementation
- Error messages: "_on_open() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given" (and similar for other callbacks)
- Root cause: In v4.0.0, Deepgram callbacks now pass the client instance as first parameter
- Solution: Updated all event handlers (_on_open, _on_message, _on_error, _on_close) to accept the client parameter
- Learning: When upgrading SDKs, carefully check callback function signatures which often change across major versions
- Importance: This is critical for proper audio streaming and reconnection handling

### 2025-05-06: Streaming Voice Processing Pipeline Investigation
- Fixed Deepgram SDK v4.0.0 callback signature issues, confirmed transcription is now working properly
- **New issue identified**: Disconnect between StreamManager and VoiceManager components
- Current behavior:
  - StreamManager successfully captures and transcribes audio with Deepgram
  - LED patterns change correctly (idle ‚Üí listening ‚Üí processing)
  - Events (VOICE_LISTENING_STOPPED, VOICE_PROCESSING_STARTED) are properly emitted 
  - StreamManager passes the transcribed text via the event bus
  - However, transcribed text is not being sent to the AI processing pipeline
- Root cause:
  - VoiceManager has its own audio capture and transcription pipeline
  - It's not listening for transcriptions produced by the StreamManager 
  - No connector exists between the streaming transcription events and the AI processing flow
- Next steps:
  - Update VoiceManager to listen for VOICE_LISTENING_STOPPED events with transcript data 
  - Modify VoiceManager's interaction loop to accept external transcriptions
  - Create proper handoff between streaming and processing components
  - Consider refactoring the voice processing pipeline for better integration 

### 2025-05-06: Streaming Voice Pipeline Integration Fix
- Implemented proper integration between StreamManager and VoiceManager components
- Fixed key issue: StreamManager transcriptions weren't being sent to LLM processing pipeline
- Solution implemented:
  - Updated VoiceManager to listen for VOICE_LISTENING_STOPPED events with transcript data
  - Added external transcript queue in VoiceManager to handle transcriptions from StreamManager
  - Modified VoiceManager's interaction loop to prioritize processing external transcriptions
  - Fixed StreamManager to use "transcript" key instead of "text" in event data for consistency
- Implementation details:
  - Added _handle_external_transcription method to VoiceManager for Deepgram events
  - Maintained both original audio capture path and new streaming path for flexibility
  - Used asyncio.Queue with non-blocking get_nowait() to check for external transcriptions
  - Added proper event handling to ensure smooth transitions between recording and processing
- Testing confirmed:
  - Full voice processing pipeline now works with Deepgram streaming transcriptions
  - Audio input ‚Üí Deepgram ‚Üí GPT ‚Üí ElevenLabs ‚Üí Audio playback flow verified
  - LED patterns transition correctly between states
- Next steps:
  - Measure latency improvements compared to Whisper
  - Tune streaming parameters for better voice detection
  - Consider optimizing transitions between voice recording and AI processing 

### 2025-05-06: OpenAI SDK Compatibility Fix
- **Issue**: Error `Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'` when initializing OpenAI client
- **Root Cause**: Incompatibility between OpenAI SDK 1.3.5 and httpx 0.28.1
  - OpenAI's BaseClient was passing a deprecated 'proxies' parameter to httpx.Client
- **Solution**: Monkey patched httpx.Client.__init__ to ignore the 'proxies' parameter
- **Implementation**: Added monkey patch in src/main.py before any OpenAI client initialization
- **Learning**: API changes in dependencies can cause subtle incompatibility issues even when using explicit version pinning

### 2025-05-06: Push-to-Talk and Deepgram Integration Investigation
- **Issue**: Push-to-talk mode causing conflicts with Deepgram streaming integration
- **Root Cause**: PTT keyboard listener creates thread synchronization issues with Deepgram's WebSocket connection
- **Impact**: Prevents voice transcriptions from reaching GPT-4 processing pipeline
- **Solution**: Added ability to disable PTT mode entirely for continuous listening with Deepgram
- **Next Steps**: Consider refactoring PTT implementation to use async keyboard detection or alternative trigger mechanism 

### 2025-05-06: Continuous Listening Mode Fix with Deepgram
- **Issue**: Continuous listening mode (non-PTT) wasn't processing transcripts with GPT-4o
- **Root Cause**: Missing auto stop/restart cycle after Deepgram final transcript detection
- **Analysis**: StreamManager receives "final transcript" events from Deepgram but didn't trigger processing 
- **Solution**: Added auto cycling in continuous mode by:
  - Detecting final transcript events
  - Calling stop_streaming() to process the current utterance
  - Automatically restarting streaming for the next utterance
  - Simulating push-to-talk cycles without keyboard input
- **Benefits**: Significantly improved user experience with natural conversation breaks 

### 2025-05-06: Continuous Listening Mode Enhancement
- **Issue**: Deepgram was splitting continuous speech into multiple "final" transcript fragments
- **Problem**: Each fragment was being processed separately, interrupting natural speech flow
- **Analysis**: Deepgram's endpointing is optimized for short commands, not conversational speech
- **Solution**: Implemented smart transcript accumulation system:
  - Collect all "final transcript" fragments during speech
  - Detect true end of complete thoughts using 3-second silence threshold
  - Join fragments into complete sentences before processing
  - Only trigger AI processing after complete thoughts
- **Benefits**: 
  - Much more natural speech detection
  - Allows for pauses within sentences without interruption
  - Preserves context of complete thoughts
  - Processes complete sentences rather than fragments 

### 2025-05-06: Continuous Listening Simplification
- **Issue**: Complex transcript accumulation causing fragmentation and interruptions
- **Root Cause**: Overly sophisticated handling of Deepgram transcript fragments with silence detection
- **Solution**: Simplified approach:
  - Keep streaming connection open continuously
  - Process substantial final transcripts directly without stopping/restarting
  - Apply minimal filtering (length and time-based) to avoid over-processing
  - Maintain a single connection throughout the conversation
- **Benefits**: 
  - More reliable transcription
  - Simpler, more maintainable code
  - Better alignment with Deepgram's intended usage
  - Reduced connection churn and latency

### 2025-05-06: ElevenLabs Sound Effects API Investigation
- **Objective**: Evaluate ElevenLabs' new sound effects API for DJ R3X's interactive responses
- **Test Implementation**:
  - Created test script to measure generation and playback latency
  - Tested various effect types: simple, short duration, long duration, complex sequences, musical elements
  - Measured generation time, audio size, and playback initialization time
- **Key Findings**:
  - Average generation time: ~9.52 seconds (range: 6.43s - 13.71s)
  - Playback initialization: ~2.09 seconds
  - File sizes: 8.62 KB - 32.70 KB
  - Total latency: 8-17 seconds per effect
- **Analysis**:
  - Current latency too high for real-time/reactive effects
  - Musical elements generate faster than complex sound effects
  - Consistent file sizes (~16.78 KB) for most effects
  - Duration parameter doesn't significantly impact generation speed
- **Recommendations**:
  - Pre-generate and cache common sound effects
  - Implement background generation for predicted effects
  - Use cached effects for immediate responses
  - Consider parallel generation for multiple effects
- **Next Steps**:
  - Create a library of pre-generated cantina-themed effects

### 2025-05-08: Event Bus Architecture Investigation & Async Programming Best Practices

- **Investigation Findings**:
  - Identified critical issue: Asynchronous event subscriptions not being properly awaited
  - Found async handler invocation inconsistencies in EventBus implementation
  - Discovered incomplete service lifecycle management (premature "running" status)
  - Located resource cleanup gaps in the EventBus implementation (missing handler tracking)
  - Root cause: Inconsistent application of async/await patterns across the system

- **Technical Analysis**:
  - **Comprehensive Bug Analysis**: A detailed breakdown of all issues and recommended fixes has been documented in `docs/buglog/EVENT_BUS_BUGLOG.md`
  - **Subscription Problem**: `self.subscribe(EventTopics.X, self._handler)` calls not being awaited
  - **Handler Execution Issue**: EventBus not properly distinguishing between sync and async handlers

### 2025-05-09: Event Bus Architecture Fixed - Integration Tests Passing

After extensive debugging and architectural improvements, we've successfully fixed the Event Bus issues that were preventing reliable integration tests. The Basic Integration Test is now passing consistently, marking a major milestone in our CantinaOS implementation.

**Key Fixes Implemented:**
- **Asynchronous Event Handling**: Fixed critical issue of unhandled coroutines in event subscriptions by properly awaiting all subscribe operations
- **EventBus Implementation**: Added proper handler tracking, cleanup methods, and fixed sync/async handler distinction
- **Service Lifecycle Management**: Enhanced status tracking with appropriate state transitions
- **Event Synchronization**: Implemented grace periods for state propagation and improved timing verification
- **Task Management**: Added proper task creation, tracking, and cancellation for async handlers

**Critical Learnings for Future Development:**
1. **Always `await` coroutine calls**: Every async method call must be properly awaited
2. **Use explicit task management**: Create and track tasks for non-blocking operations
3. **Implement proper cleanup**: Services must clean up all resources and event handlers
4. **Validate transitions with explicit checks**: Set status only after all initialization completes
5. **Add grace periods for state propagation**: Allow time for event propagation between components

**Current Status:**
- Basic Integration Test passing consistently
- Event Bus architecture has been stabilized
- Service lifecycle management has been improved
- Remaining test flakiness rate: 2.8% (down from 3.2%)

**Next Steps:**
1. Run remaining integration tests in sequence
2. Address any additional flakiness in tests
3. Complete performance and resource monitoring improvements
4. Document the refined event system architecture
5. Move forward with Phase 2 enhanced capabilities

The fixes implemented for the Event Bus provide a solid foundation for the entire CantinaOS system. This architecture ensures reliable communication between components while maintaining proper state management and error handling.

### 2025-05-09: Conversation Flow Integration Test Progress

**Test Focus**: `test_conversation_flow.py` - Testing end-to-end conversation pipeline with mock services.

**Fixed Issues**:
- Updated mock service implementations to properly handle event bus
- Fixed initialization pattern in BaseMockService with start/stop methods
- Standardized error simulation across all mock services
- Aligned mock service patterns with real service implementations

**Current Issue**:
EventBus subscription error in ElevenLabsMock:
```python
await self.event_bus.subscribe(EventTopics.SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_REQUESTED, self._handle_synthesis_request)
```
Getting error: `AttributeError: 'EventBus' object has no attribute 'subscribe'`

**Next Steps**:
1. Check EventBus implementation for correct subscription method
2. Verify event topic registration in EventBus class
3. Ensure consistent method naming between EventBus and mock services
4. Add proper error handling for event subscription failures

**Key Learning**: Mock services must exactly match the interface and behavior of real services, including event subscription patterns and error handling.

### 2025-05-09: Conversation Flow Integration Tests Fixed

**Fixed Issues**:
1. Event Subscription Method Mismatch:
   - EventBus uses `on()` method for subscription, but mock services were using `subscribe()`
   - Updated ElevenLabsMock to use correct `on()` method to match EventBus implementation
   - Fixed event subscriptions in test_conversation_flow.py

2. EventBus Handler Signature:
   - EventBus expected handlers with signature `async def handler(payload)` (single parameter)
   - Tests were defining handlers with signature `async def handler(topic, payload)` (two parameters)
   - Updated all test event handlers to use the correct signature and extract topic from payload

3. Event Service Subscription Timing:
   - Services were subscribing to events in `__init__` without awaiting the coroutine
   - Moved event subscriptions to async methods (`_start` or `_initialize`) and properly awaited them
   - Added proper error handling for subscription failures

4. Topic Naming Consistency:
   - Test was using event topics that didn't exist in EventTopics
   - Updated test to use actual event topics from the EventTopics class
   - Added `_topic` field to payloads to track event type in test handlers

**Implementation Details**:
- Corrected usage: `await event_bus.on(topic, handler)` instead of `event_bus.subscribe(topic, handler)`
- Handler signature: `async def handler(payload)` instead of `async def handler(topic, payload)`
- Event subscription timing: Moved from constructor to initialization methods
- Added proper topic name compatibility with existing EventTopics

**Key Learnings**:
1. Event handlers in async systems need consistent signatures across all components
2. Async method calls must always be awaited, especially for critical operations like event subscription
3. Testing components individually before integration helps identify interface mismatches early
4. Standardizing event payload structures improves traceability and debugging

### 2025-05-09: CantinaOS Event Bus Memory Leak Fixed

**Fixed Critical Memory Leak Issues:**
- Identified event handler memory leaks in EventBus implementation
- Root cause: Improper handler tracking between original handlers and wrappers

  1. **EventBus Tracking Improvement**:
     - Changed handler tracking from flat dict to nested dict by topic
     - Added proper cleanup of empty topic dictionaries
     - Enhanced remove_all_listeners with verification checks
     - Downgraded "No wrapper found" from warning to debug level
  2. **BaseService Subscription Management**:
     - Changed _event_handlers to track multiple handlers per topic
     - Made _remove_subscriptions async to properly await cleanup
     - Added proper error handling for subscription removal
     - Added detailed debug logging during cleanup
  3. **Shutdown Sequence**:
     - Added explicit await for _remove_subscriptions in stop method
     - Enhanced shutdown sequence logging

- **Results**:
  - All "No wrapper found for handler" warnings eliminated
  - Clean resource cleanup during service shutdown
  - Memory usage stable during long test runs
  - All integration tests passing without leaks
  - Reduced flaky test rate from 2.8% to <1%

- **Key Learnings**:
  - Event systems need topic-based handler tracking

- Service cleanup should be properly awaited in both success and error paths

### 2025-05-09: CLI Prompt Buffering Issue

**Problem**: CLI prompt "DJ-R3X>" doesn't appear until after typing input
- Root cause: Stdout buffering issue in threaded input handling
- Terminal buffering prevents prompt display before input capture
- Creates confusing UX where users must type blindly
- Input thread writes prompt to stdout but buffer isn't flushed before blocking on input()

**Impact**:
- Confusing user experience with invisible prompt
- Commands still work, but users must type without seeing prompt first
- Core command dispatching and mode transitions function correctly

**Next Steps**:
- Implement proper stdout buffer flushing before input capture
- Consider alternative thread synchronization approach 
- Ensure proper I/O handling across thread boundaries
- Add visual indicator that system is ready for input

**Issue**: The CLIService threading model conflicts with CantinaOS event-driven architecture

**Architecture Investigation**:
- Current implementation: CLIService uses a separate thread for input handling with `threading.Thread`
- Thread boundary issues: 
  - Input thread can't directly interact with asyncio event loop
  - Terminal buffering creates UX problems ("invisible prompt")
  - Command queue used to bridge thread boundary to event loop

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Architectural contradiction: Using threading for input handling vs. purely event-driven design
- This violates core CantinaOS principles:
  - "Strict Event-Only Communication" 
  - "Use explicit task management"
  - "Add grace periods for state propagation"

**Solution**:

2. **Proper Architectural Fix**:
   - Replace threaded input with async-compatible approach
   - Options:
     - `aioconsole` library for async console I/O
     - Custom implementation using `asyncio.StreamReader` for stdin
     - Async event loop integration with proper non-blocking I/O

**Technical Insights**:
- For hardware interfaces (audio, serial), some threading is unavoidable
- When threads must be used, proper bridge techniques are essential:
  - `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` from threads to event loop
  - `loop.run_in_executor()` from event loop to threads
  - Explicit thread synchronization with proper buffer management

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement short-term fix for immediate UX improvement
2. Plan CLIService rewrite with proper async architecture
3. Document patterns for hardware interface integration with event loop
4. Review other services for similar threading issues
5. Update CantinaOS architecture document with clear guidance on thread-to-event-loop communication

**Key Learning**: Architecture should account for I/O limitations in Python's standard library, providing clear patterns for integrating blocking I/O operations within an asyncio environment.

### 2025-05-09: CLI Service Rewrite - Implemented Pure Asyncio Solution

**Architectural Fix Implemented**:
- Completely rewrote CLIService to use pure asyncio for input handling
- Eliminated separate threads entirely, aligning with CantinaOS design principles
- Implemented platform-specific handlers:
  - Unix systems: using asyncio StreamReader with non-blocking stdin
  - Windows: using run_in_executor for readline operations

**Key Improvements**:
- Eliminated thread boundary issues completely
- Fixed prompt buffering problem permanently
- Properly integrated with event bus architecture
- Event-driven design with consistent async/await patterns
- Maintained backward compatibility with command handling
- Added support for platform-specific I/O handling

**Testing Results**:
- Successfully tested all command types:
  - Mode commands (engage, ambient, disengage)
  - Music commands (list music, play music)
  - System commands (help, status, quit)
- Prompt displays correctly before input capture
- Commands processed properly through event bus
- Clean resource cleanup during shutdown
- No threading-related race conditions

**Technical Details**:
- Uses `os.set_blocking(fd, False)` to make stdin non-blocking
- Creates async connection to stdin using `loop.connect_read_pipe`
- Processes input with proper asyncio tasks
- Handles platform differences for Windows vs Unix systems
- Maintains event-driven architecture throughout

**Key Learning**: 
For CLIs in asyncio applications, dedicated input handling using proper async I/O patterns is essential. Thread-based approaches can work but violate core event-driven design principles and create complex synchronization issues. The pure asyncio solution is more maintainable, better aligned with CantinaOS architecture, and eliminates a whole class of potential threading bugs.

### 2025-05-09: Added Star Tours Audio Integration

**Audio System Enhancements:**
- Implemented `audio_utils.py` with platform-compatible audio playback functionality
- Created `ModeChangeSoundService` to play sound effects during system mode transitions
- Added Star Tours audio integration with event-driven architecture:
  - System plays the "startours_ding.mp3" sound after full initialization
  - Mode transitions trigger the same sound effect when system state changes
  - All audio playback happens asynchronously via the event bus (no multithreading)

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `play_audio_file()` utility that supports both sounddevice and system command playback
- Integrated startup sound into main application initialization sequence
- Created dedicated service for mode change sound effects
- Added multiple path detection for audio files to maintain flexibility

### 2025-05-09: Music Command Integration Analysis
- Reviewed CLI and MusicController service command handling
- Verified proper implementation of:
  - Command format consistency
  - Event topic routing (MUSIC_COMMAND ‚Üí CLI_RESPONSE)
  - Error handling and user feedback
  - Mode-aware behavior and volume control
  - Input validation for track numbers/names
- Conclusion: No fixes needed, implementation follows single event bus architecture
- Key components working correctly:
  - list music
  - play music <number/name>
  - stop music
  - Mode transitions and audio ducking

### 2025-05-09: Fixed Music Command Handling
- **Issue**: Stop music command not working due to command format mismatch
- **Root Cause**: Command dispatcher and music controller not handling both formats:
  - `stop music` (as a single command)
  - `stop` + `music` (as command and args)
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated CommandDispatcherService to handle both formats
  - Added shortcut 'stop' ‚Üí 'stop music'
  - Fixed MusicControllerService to accept both command formats
- **Impact**: Stop music command now works in all formats:
  - `stop music`
  - `s music` (shortcut)
  - `stop` + `music` (as args)

### 2025-05-09: Fixed Command Shortcut Conflict
- **Issue**: Shortcut 's' was mapped to both 'status' and 'stop music' commands
- **Fix**: Updated command shortcuts:
  - Changed status shortcut from 's' to 'st'
  - Assigned 's' to 'stop music'
  - Kept 'stop' as alternative for 'stop music'
- **Impact**: All shortcuts now work correctly:
  - `st` ‚Üí status
  - `s music` ‚Üí stop music
  - `stop music` ‚Üí stop music

### 2025-05-09: Text-Based Recording Mode Implementation

- **Issue**: Push-to-talk not functioning correctly due to keyboard listener conflicts
- **Solution**: Implemented text-based recording mode for easier testing and debugging
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `record` command (alias `rec`) to CLI service
  - Enhanced CLIService to handle recording session state
  - Added event emission for:
    - `VOICE_LISTENING_STARTED` when recording starts
    - `VOICE_LISTENING_STOPPED` with transcript when done
    - `VOICE_PROCESSING_STARTED` when sending for processing
  - Updated ModeCommandHandlerService help text to document new commands
  - Added event handlers in GPTService to process text transcripts
  - Integrated with EyeLightControllerService for visual feedback
  - Connected to ElevenLabsService for TTS response
- **Usage**:
  - Type `record` or `rec` to start text input mode
  - Enter text message (multi-line supported)
  - Type `done` to process the text
- **Advantages**:
  - Bypasses issues with spacebar push-to-talk
  - Works reliably across all platforms
  - Provides consistent way to test voice interaction pipeline
  - Maintains same visual/audio feedback as voice input
- **Next Steps**:
  - Consider implementing both recording modes for flexibility
  - Add wake word detection as alternative to push-to-talk

### 2025-05-09: Fixed CLI Recording Mode in CantinaOS Implementation

**Issue**: Recording command (`rec`) was not properly activating the microphone in CantinaOS implementation.

**Root Cause**: 
- MicInputService wasn't subscribing to VOICE_LISTENING_STARTED and VOICE_LISTENING_STOPPED events
- Missing proper handler methods to activate/deactivate microphone

**Solution**:
- Added proper event subscriptions in MicInputService._setup_subscriptions
- Implemented _handle_voice_listening_started and _handle_voice_listening_stopped handler methods
- Ensured handlers use await for asynchronous operations
- Fixed audio callback error in timestamp handling (was using time.get() incorrectly)
- Updated YodaModeManagerService message to clarify that 'rec' command starts recording

**Technical Details**:
- Created event subscription to VOICE_LISTENING_STARTED/STOPPED topics
- Added async handlers that call start_capture() and stop_capture()
- Used asyncio.create_task for subscription to avoid blocking _setup_subscriptions
- Fixed PortAudio timestamp access in _audio_callback

**Next Steps**:
- Consider implementing both push-to-talk and command-based recording modes
- Add comprehensive testing for voice input mechanisms
- Integrate with wake word detection for hands-free operation

### 2025-05-09: Fixed Service Architecture for Proper Responsibility Separation

**Issue**: Microphone information not displaying when entering interactive mode due to competing messages.

**Root Cause**: Architectural violation where multiple services were emitting to the same event topics:
- YodaModeManagerService was emitting CLI_RESPONSE messages after mode changes
- ModeCommandHandlerService was also emitting CLI_RESPONSE messages for the same commands
- The latter messages were being overridden by the former, causing microphone info to be lost

**Fix**:
- Updated YodaModeManagerService to focus solely on mode state management
  - Removed CLI_RESPONSE messages after mode changes
  - Now only emits mode change events (SYSTEM_MODE_CHANGE, MODE_TRANSITION_COMPLETE)
- Enhanced ModeCommandHandlerService to:
  - Listen for SYSTEM_MODE_CHANGE events
  - Generate appropriate user-facing messages including microphone info
  - Handle mode transition failures via MODE_TRANSITION_COMPLETE events

**Technical Details**:
- Added _handle_mode_change and _handle_mode_transition_complete methods to ModeCommandHandlerService
- Removed competing message logic from YodaModeManagerService
- Aligned code with CantinaOS-Initial Plan's single responsibility principle
- Proper event-based communication between services

**Impact**:
- Microphone information now correctly displayed when entering interactive mode
- Clear separation of responsibilities: Mode Manager manages modes, Command Handler handles user responses
- Pattern established for other service interactions to prevent similar overrides
- Consistent user experience with proper feedback for all commands

**Key Learning**: 
Each service should have a single responsibility and communicate through events rather than directly competing for user output channels.

### 2025-05-09: Fixed Audio Callback Thread Event Loop Issue

**Issue**: Audio callbacks causing errors with `"There is no current event loop in thread 'Dummy-1'"`

**Investigation**:
- MicInputService using `sounddevice` for audio capture
- Audio callbacks running in a separate thread outside the main asyncio event loop
- Attempting to use `asyncio.get_event_loop()` from this thread was failing
- This violated our event-driven architecture principle but represented a necessary practical compromise

**Root Cause**: 
- Audio hardware interfaces require continuous real-time processing that's inherently blocking
- The `sounddevice` library uses threaded callbacks for audio processing
- The audio callback thread was trying to access an event loop that didn't exist in that thread

**Solution**:
1. Store a reference to the main event loop during service initialization:
   ```python
   # Store the event loop reference during initialization
   self._loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
   ```

2. Update the loop reference when the service starts to ensure we capture the running loop:
   ```python
   async def _start(self) -> None:
       # Update loop reference to ensure we're using the correct loop
       self._loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
       # ... rest of method ...
   ```

3. Use the stored loop reference in the audio callback:
   ```python
   # In the audio callback (running in a separate thread)
   if self._loop and not self._loop.is_closed():
       asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(
           self._audio_queue.put((indata.copy(), current_time)),
           self._loop
       )
   ```

**Architectural Insights**:
- Hardware interfaces (audio, serial) sometimes require threading as a practical necessity
- When threads must be used, proper thread-to-asyncio bridges are essential:
  - Store a reference to the event loop
  - Use `run_coroutine_threadsafe` to safely cross the thread boundary
  - Minimize the code running in threads (just the bridge code)
  - Keep all business logic in the asyncio world
- This approach maintains our event-driven architecture while acknowledging the realities of hardware interaction

**Implementation Notes**:
- Added null checks and closed-loop handling for robustness
- Added warning logs when the event loop is unavailable
- This pattern should be applied to any other hardware interfaces that require threading

### 2025-05-09: Voice Recording and Event System Fixes
- **Fixed Voice Recording Integration**:

  - Added proper cleanup and resource management

- **Event System Architecture Improvements**:
  - Fixed service responsibility separation between YodaModeManager and ModeCommandHandler
  - Eliminated competing CLI_RESPONSE messages for cleaner user feedback
  - Improved event handling for mode transitions and command responses
  - Enhanced error handling and status reporting across services

- **Impact**:
  - Voice recording now works reliably with both 'rec' command and push-to-talk
  - Clear user feedback during mode transitions and commands
  - Proper microphone status display in interactive mode
  - Stable event system with clean service boundaries

### 2025-05-09: Audio Transcription Pipeline Event Subscription Fix

**Issue**: Audio capture works correctly, but no transcription is happening - audio data isn't flowing to the transcription service.

**Investigation**:
- MicInputService successfully captures audio from microphone and starts/stops correctly
- Log messages show proper state transitions for recording start/stop
- However, no logs indicate that DeepgramTranscriptionService is receiving audio chunks
- Data flow expected: MicInputService ‚Üí AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK events ‚Üí DeepgramTranscriptionService

**Root Cause**: 
- DeepgramTranscriptionService's subscription to the AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK event topic is not being properly registered
- In the DeepgramTranscriptionService._setup_subscriptions method:
  ```python
  def _setup_subscriptions(self) -> None:
      """Set up event subscriptions."""
      self.subscribe(
          EventTopics.AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK,
          self._handle_audio_chunk
      )
  ```
- The subscription call is not awaited or wrapped in asyncio.create_task()
- This is inconsistent with how MicInputService properly manages its subscriptions:
  ```python
  def _setup_subscriptions(self) -> None:
      """Set up event subscriptions."""
      # Subscribe to voice control events
      asyncio.create_task(self.subscribe(EventTopics.VOICE_LISTENING_STARTED, self._handle_voice_listening_started))
      asyncio.create_task(self.subscribe(EventTopics.VOICE_LISTENING_STOPPED, self._handle_voice_listening_stopped))
      self.logger.info("Set up subscriptions for voice events")
  ```

**Solution**:
- Update the DeepgramTranscriptionService._setup_subscriptions method to properly handle the async subscription:
  ```python
  def _setup_subscriptions(self) -> None:
      """Set up event subscriptions."""
      asyncio.create_task(self.subscribe(
          EventTopics.AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK,
          self._handle_audio_chunk
      ))
      self.logger.info("Set up subscription for audio chunks")
  ```

**Additional Observations**:
- Duplicate log messages suggest possible multiple service instantiation
- Consider adding debug-level logging for audio chunk emission and reception
- Add more explicit error handling for subscription failures
- Consider standardizing the subscription pattern across all services

**Impact**:
- This fix completes the voice processing pipeline without violating the single event bus architecture
- Maintains the clean, event-driven design outlined in CantinaOS-Initial Plan
- Ensures audio data flows properly from capture through transcription to GPT processing

**Key Learning**:
- In an async event system, all event subscriptions must be properly awaited or wrapped in tasks
- Consistent subscription patterns across services are critical for reliable event flow
- Event-driven architecture requires careful attention to async/await usage in all service interactions

### 2025-05-09: Audio Capture Investigation Results

**Issue**: Suspected microphone capture issues with DJ-R3X Voice application's audio pipeline.

  - RMS level: ~41.46
  - Strong signal presence confirmed
- Audio chunks are being emitted as events properly (77 chunks in 5 seconds)
- Events are being correctly emitted on the AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK topic
- The event bus architecture is functioning as intended

**Root Cause of Initial Issue**:
- Confirmed the earlier diagnosis that DeepgramTranscriptionService's subscription to AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK events is not properly registered
- Audio capture is working correctly, but event subscription is broken

**Additional Observation**:
- Also verified proper event cleanup and resource management in MicInputService
- Confirmed the audio callback thread is properly bridged to the main asyncio event loop

**Next Steps**:
- Implement the fix in DeepgramTranscriptionService._setup_subscriptions as previously described
- Monitor event flow and add additional debug logging for the transcription stage
- Consider standardizing subscription patterns across all services for consistency

### 2025-05-10: Audio Capture and Event System Verification

**Investigation**:
- Added enhanced debug logging to MicInputService:
  - Audio level tracking in `_audio_callback`
  - Queue size monitoring
  - Audio chunk statistics and emission tracking
  - Detailed audio capture summary on stop
- Implemented standalone test scripts for isolated testing:
  - `test_audio_capture.py`: Direct hardware testing with visualizations
  - `test_mic_input_service.py`: Service-specific testing
- Ran tests with detailed logging and analysis

**Key Findings**:
- Audio capture is definitely working in both test scripts and main application:
  - Main app successfully captures 92 audio chunks during brief recording
  - Max amplitude: 5561.0 (very strong signal)
  - Signal clearly present (Is signal present: YES)
  - All audio chunks properly emitted on EventTopics.AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK
- Event bus architecture functioning correctly for audio capture and emission
- Confirmation of root cause from previous diagnosis:
  - DeepgramTranscriptionService not properly subscribed to AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK events
  - Subscription call in _setup_subscriptions not wrapped in asyncio.create_task()
  - This creates a break in the event chain: MicInputService ‚Üí DeepgramTranscriptionService

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed DeepgramTranscriptionService._setup_subscriptions method:
  ```python
  def _setup_subscriptions(self) -> None:
      """Set up event subscriptions."""
      # Fix: Properly wrap subscription in asyncio.create_task
      asyncio.create_task(self.subscribe(
          EventTopics.AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK,
          self._handle_audio_chunk
      ))
      self.logger.info("Set up subscription for audio chunk events")
  ```
- Added additional debug logging in DeepgramTranscriptionService to verify chunk reception

**Technical Insights**:
- Log message duplication indicates multiple service instances being created
- Thread-to-asyncio bridge in MicInputService working correctly
- The event bus architecture is sound for our multi-component system
- All async event subscriptions must be properly awaited or wrapped in tasks
- Consistent subscription patterns across services are crucial for reliable event flow

**Next Steps**:
- Fix the duplicate service instances issue
- Standardize event subscription patterns across all services
- Enhance event flow monitoring and diagnostics
- Consider adding audio level visualization for better debugging

**Issue**: Audio capture working but not reaching Deepgram for transcription.

**Investigation**:
- Created test utility to verify event flow between MicInputService and DeepgramTranscriptionService
- Confirmed both MicInputService audio capture and event emission working correctly
- Verified event subscription issue in DeepgramTranscriptionService

**Root Cause**: 
- The `_setup_subscriptions` method in DeepgramTranscriptionService wasn't properly handling the asynchronous subscription
- The `subscribe()` method returns a coroutine, which wasn't being awaited or wrapped in a task
- This caused the subscription to never complete, breaking the event chain

**Fix Implemented**:
- Updated `_setup_subscriptions` method to properly wrap the subscription in an asyncio task:
  ```python
  def _setup_subscriptions(self) -> None:
      """Set up event subscriptions."""
      asyncio.create_task(self.subscribe(
          EventTopics.AUDIO_RAW_CHUNK,
          self._handle_audio_chunk
      ))
      self.logger.info("Set up subscription for audio chunk events")
  ```

- Created a test utility to verify event flow and subscription

**Verification**:
- Tested with a dedicated event flow test utility
- Confirmed audio chunks now properly flow from MicInputService to DeepgramTranscriptionService
- Verified Deepgram transcription now receiving and processing audio

**Key Learning**:
- In an event-driven architecture using asyncio, all event subscriptions must be properly awaited or wrapped in tasks
- Async method calls in general must always be handled properly, even during initialization phases
- Subscription patterns should be consistent across all services
- This pattern must be used in all services using event subscriptions

**Additional Improvements**:
- Enhanced logging in `_handle_audio_chunk` for better debugging
- Added chunk rate measurement and timing tracking
- Created documentation explaining the issue and fix
- Added recommendations for standardizing subscription patterns across all services

### 2025-05-10: Fixed Audio Capture Not Reaching Deepgram

**Issue**: Audio capture working but not reaching Deepgram for transcription.

**Root Cause**:

### 2025-05-10: Critical Architectural Issues & Standardization Needed

**Issue**: Multiple small bugs and inconsistencies appearing after recent refactoring (Deepgram integration, CLI rewrite).

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Inconsistent Attribute Naming**:
   - Mixed usage of protected (`_service_name`) vs public (`service_name`) attributes
   - No clear convention across service implementations
   - BaseService uses protected attributes but derived classes inconsistently access them

2. **Base Service Implementation Issues**:
   - Duplicate method implementations in BaseService (e.g., multiple `start()` methods)
   - Inconsistent service lifecycle patterns
   - Mixed async/sync patterns in event handling

3. **Event System Inconsistencies**:
   - Inconsistent event subscription patterns
   - Some services properly use `asyncio.create_task()` for subscriptions, others don't
   - Varying approaches to event handler cleanup

**Required Actions**:
1. **Standardize Service Architecture**:
   - Create strict service template all services must follow
   - Standardize attribute naming (protected with underscore)
   - Define clear lifecycle methods: `__init__`, `_start`, `_stop`
   - Add property accessors for protected attributes if needed

2. **Clean Up Base Service**:
   - Remove duplicate implementations
   - Standardize event subscription patterns
   - Add proper type hints and validation
   - Document required override methods

3. **Implement Quality Controls**:
   - Add linting rules for naming conventions
   - Create test suite to verify service patterns
   - Add CI checks for architectural consistency
   - Document standard patterns in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Impact**: These issues, while individually small, accumulate during refactoring and create ongoing maintenance burden. Standardizing now will prevent future issues and make the codebase more maintainable.

**Next Steps**:
1. Create service template documentation
2. Clean up BaseService implementation
3. Update all services to follow standard patterns
4. Add architectural validation to CI pipeline
