# DJ R3X Voice App ‚Äî Dev Log (Engineering Journal)

## üìå Project Overview
DJ R3X is an animatronic character from Star Wars that operates as a DJ at Oga's Cantina. This project aims to recreate the voice and animation features of DJ R3X, allowing for interactive conversations with realistic voice synthesis and synchronized LED animations.

The application is built with an event-driven architecture with the following core components:
- **Event Bus (EB)** - Central communication hub for all components
- **Voice Manager (VM)** - Handles speech recognition, AI processing, and voice synthesis
- **LED Manager (LM)** - Controls LED animations on eyes and mouth
- **Music Manager (MM)** - Manages background music and audio ducking
- **Holocron Knowledge (HK)** - Provides Star Wars canonical knowledge via RAG system

## üîé Code Investigations & Discoveries
- Audio RMS envelope calculation effective for LED mouth synchronization (~50fps)
- Mouth animation latency must stay under 100ms for natural appearance
- Asyncio best practices critical for stability:
  - Tasks require explicit cancellation; boolean flags alone are insufficient
  - Blocking I/O (serial, audio) must use run_in_executor
  - Thread-based inputs (keyboard) need proper bridges via run_coroutine_threadsafe
  - Cross-thread communication requires explicit lifecycle management
- Arduino communication needs robust error handling, retries, and state reconciliation
- Components require explicit cleanup for mode transitions, not just application shutdown

## üêû Known Bugs / Technical Limitations
- Voice detection latency varies with microphone quality and ambient noise
- Arduino serial communication introduces slight delay in LED animations
- Audio ducking creates occasionally noticeable transitions in background music
- Audio playback via sounddevice fails silently on some platforms
- Cross-thread communication requires careful event loop reference management

## üí° Feature Backlog & Design Notes
- Move LED Manager to ESP32 for wireless control
- Add servo control for physical movements
- Implement wake word detection for hands-free operation
- Add beat detection for music-synchronized animations
- Create web dashboard for configuration and monitoring

### 2025-05-06: Event Bus Architecture Investigation
- Investigated error: "RuntimeError: no running event loop" when using push-to-talk mode
- Confirmed event bus architecture is the right approach for coordinating multiple hardware components
- Discovered key issue: synchronous keyboard listener (pynput) cannot directly interact with asyncio event loop
- Need to implement proper "bridge" between synchronous threads and asyncio using thread-safe methods
- Architecture insight: The event bus design is sound for our multi-component system, but requires careful handling of cross-thread communication
- Approach: Use asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe() or loop.call_soon_threadsafe() to properly schedule events from synchronous contexts

### 2025-05-06: Event Bus Async Handler Fix
- Enhanced EventBus to properly handle mixed sync/async event handlers with task gathering
- Fixed LED animation timing issues by properly awaiting async event handlers 

### 2025-05-06: LED Configuration Update

### 2025-05-06: Push-to-Talk Event Loop Reference Fix
- Fixed critical error: "Task got Future <_GatheringFuture pending> attached to a different loop"
- Root cause: Event loop reference mismatch between initialization and execution phases
- Problem detail: VoiceManager captures event loop with `asyncio.get_event_loop()` during init, but `asyncio.run()` in main.py creates a new loop
- When keyboard listener thread uses `run_coroutine_threadsafe()`, it references wrong loop
- Solution: Pass the running event loop explicitly from main.py to VoiceManager, ensuring consistent loop references
- Learning: When using asyncio with threaded callbacks, always capture the running loop explicitly with `asyncio.get_running_loop()` and pass it to components requiring cross-thread communication

  - Transaction support for data consistency
- **Result**: Significant performance improvement with reliable processing

### 2025-05-07: Fixed Canon URL Collection Subcategories Bug
- **Issue:** KeyError in subcategories tracking during URL categorization
- **Root Cause:** Subcategories dictionary initialized with category types instead of priority levels
- **Fix:**
  ```python
  self.subcategories = {
      "high": set(),
      "medium-high": set(),
      "medium": set(),
      "medium-low": set(),
      "low": set()
  }
  ```

  - Aligned subcategory tracking with priority-based organization
  - Ensures consistent categorization across all priority levels
  - Optimized dry-run mode to skip API calls, using URL-based categorization only
  - Removed overly conservative rate limiting (MediaWiki allows 50 req/sec)

### 2025-05-07: Adjusted Canon URL Priority Scoring
- **Initial Distribution Analysis:**
  - High Priority: 0.5% (244 articles)
  - Medium Priority: 0.9% (438 articles)
  - Low Priority: 98.6% (48,604 articles)
  - Medium-high and Medium-low: 0%

- **Scoring Adjustments:**
  - Increased weights for droid and entertainment terms (3.0 ‚Üí 4.0)
  - Increased related content weight (1.0 ‚Üí 2.0)
  - Adjusted category match weights upward
  - Lowered priority thresholds to better distribute content:
    ```python
    PRIORITY_THRESHOLDS = {
        "high": 4.5,         # Unchanged
        "medium-high": 3.0,  # Was 3.5
        "medium": 2.0,       # Was 2.5
        "medium-low": 1.0,   # Was 1.5
        "low": 0.0          # Unchanged
    }
    ```

- **Expected Improvements:**
  - Better distribution across priority levels
  - More droid and entertainment content in medium-high category
  - More related content in medium and medium-low categories
  - Reduced number of low-priority articles

### 2025-05-07: Optimized Canon URL Collection Process
- **Performance Bottleneck Resolution:**
  - Identified slow URL categorization and database writes
  - Previous: Sequential processing of 49,286 URLs
  - Solution: Implemented batch processing and parallel execution

- **Next Steps:**
  1. Monitor batch size impact on performance
  2. Consider implementing retry mechanism for failed batches
  3. Add checkpointing for long-running processes
  4. Implement parallel content processing pipeline

### 2025-05-07: Fixed Canon URL Storage Issue
- **Issue Identified**: URLs not being saved to Supabase during batch collection
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  1. Double processing in `collect_canon_urls.py`
  2. `process_all_urls()` called twice: once in main loop and again in `store_urls()`
  3. Second call overwrites results from first call
  4. Results in empty batches being sent to Supabase

- **Technical Details**:
  ```python
  # Original problematic flow:
  await collector.process_all_urls()  # First call in main()
  await store_urls(collector, dry_run=args.dry_run)
    # which calls process_all_urls() again internally
  ```

- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Removed redundant `process_all_urls()` call from main()
  2. Enhanced error handling in `store_batch()` to raise exceptions
  3. Added detailed logging for batch storage operations
  4. Added result verification after batch storage

### 2025-05-07: Fixed URL Priority Enum Error
- **Issue Identified**: Full URL collection failing with database enum errors
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  1. Schema constraint in database requires specific enum values for `priority` field
  2. Script was using "medium-high" and "medium-low" values that don't exist in the database schema
  3. This caused batch inserts to fail with error: `invalid input value for enum url_priority: "medium-high"`

- **Technical Details**:
  ```
  ERROR: Error processing batch: Database error during batch storage: 
  {'code': '22P02', 'details': None, 'hint': None, 
  'message': 'invalid input value for enum url_priority: "medium-high"'}
  ```

- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Simplified priority levels to match database schema: "high", "medium", "low"
  2. Updated `PRIORITY_THRESHOLDS` in the code
  3. Modified the `determine_priority()` method to only return valid enum values
  4. Tested with small batches first, then full collection

- **Results**:
  1. Batch processing successfully stores URLs in database
  2. No more enum errors with priority values
  3. Full collection process working properly

### 2025-05-07: Holocron Knowledge System Vector Overlap Analysis
- **Investigation of Vector Overlap Mechanisms**:
  - Confirmed intentional embedding overlap in chunking strategy
  - Identified key overlap points:
    1. OVERLAP_TOKENS = 100: Creates a 100-token overlap between adjacent chunks
    2. Section headers & titles duplicated across related chunks to maintain context
    3. Metadata embedding (article title, source URL) across multiple chunks
  
- **Benefits of Vector Overlap**:
  - Maintains semantic continuity between chunks
  - Prevents important context loss at chunk boundaries
  - Improves retrieval quality for concepts spanning multiple segments
  - Enhances the RAG system's ability to find relevant information

- **Test Script Development**:
  - Created `scripts/simple_holocron_chat.py` for testing vector retrievals
  - Extended `holocron/knowledge/retriever.py` to support modern Supabase client
  - Updated OpenAI client usage to be compatible with SDK v1.0+
  - Isolated vector search from other dependencies for better testing

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - OpenAI SDK version compatibility issues (v0.x vs v1.0+)
  - SQL query format for pgvector semantic search
  - Supabase client initialization parameters
  - Cross-thread async execution with proper cancellation

- **Query Processing Flow**:
  1. Generate embedding for search query
  2. Execute vector similarity search against pgvector database
  3. Format retrieved contexts for prompt injection
  4. Generate DJ R3X character response using retrieved knowledge

- **Next Steps**:
  1. Benchmark semantic retrieval quality with different overlap settings
  2. Investigate performance impact of increased vector dimensions
  3. Consider hybrid retrieval strategies (keyword + semantic)
  4. Expand test suite with canonical query examples

### 2025-05-08: Vector Search Evolution and Migration
- **Initial Implementation**: Integrated Supabase with pgvector for Holocron knowledge retrieval
  - Used HNSW indexing with parameters m=16, ef_construction=64
  - Implemented tiered fallback system for reliability (RPC ‚Üí SQL ‚Üí Basic)
  - Added metadata filtering for targeted knowledge retrieval

- **Key Challenges**:
  - **Client API Compatibility**: Fixed multiple issues with Supabase client API changes and inconsistent method patterns
  - **Connection Management**: Implemented client factory with connection pooling for reliability
  - **Vector Type Handling**: Resolved vector dimension issues (1536D) and embedding format compatibility
  - **Query Performance**: Encountered timeout issues at scale with larger knowledge base
  - **Scaling Limitations**: As content grew (50k Wookieepedia URLs ‚Üí ~200-300k vectors), hitting pgvector performance limits

- **Progressive Optimizations**:
  - Simplified search architecture to two-tier approach (Primary: RPC, Fallback: LLM)
  - Optimized RPC function for better vector handling and similarity calculations
  - Standardized error handling with graceful degradation
  - Improved monitoring and progress tracking for pipeline operations

- **Decision to Migrate to Qdrant (2025-05-08)**:
  - **Rationale**: Need for better scaling, performance, and control at our projected vector scale (200-300k)
  - **Implementation Plan**:
    - Export vectors + metadata from Supabase
    - Self-host Qdrant on cloud VM (Render, DigitalOcean, or Railway)
    - Replace SQL/RPC with Qdrant API/SDK while maintaining core workflow
  - **Expected Benefits**: Reduced costs, improved query performance, simpler scaling, full control over infrastructure

- **Core Learnings**:
  - Vector database selection should align with projected scale from the beginning
  - Purpose-built vector databases outperform general-purpose DB extensions at scale
  - Client API compatibility requires careful version management and abstraction
  - Self-hosting provides important control over performance tuning and cost management
  - Knowledge retrieval quality depends on both technical implementation and proper chunking strategy
  - **Supabase Client Patterns**:
    - Pin dependencies exactly (e.g., `supabase==2.3.5` not `>=2.3.4`) to prevent API drift
    - Use `ClientOptions` objects instead of dictionaries for client initialization
    - Properly handle synchronous vs. asynchronous client methods and avoid mixing patterns
    - Implement version detection to handle API changes gracefully
  - **Vector Search Optimization (pgvector)**:
    - HNSW index parameters significantly affect performance (m=16, ef_construction=64 works well for ~50k vectors)
    - Set appropriate `work_mem` (128MB) and `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` (2) for better performance
    - Embedding dimension standardization crucial (verify 1536D for text-embedding-ada-002)
    - Similarity threshold of 0.5 balances relevance with recall rate
  - **Pipeline Engineering**:
    - Batch processing (size 100-1000) dramatically improves throughput
    - Concurrent workers (5-10) with proper rate limiting essential for web scraping
    - Progress tracking with ETA calculations improves developer experience on long-running jobs
    - Error handling should include automatic retries with exponential backoff
    - URL processing requires careful handling of special characters (especially % symbols)
  - **Testing Vector Implementations**:
    - Mock fixtures need careful design to support both sync and async patterns
    - Test vectors must match production dimensions exactly
    - RPC function tests must validate similarity sorting and thresholds
    - Consider separating unit tests from integration tests for independent verification
    - Always test with realistic content volumes to catch scaling issues early

### 2025-05-08: Switched to GPT-4.1-mini for Holocron

  - Verified data integrity (content, embeddings, metadata)
  - Confirmed search functionality with test queries
  - Index properly configured: 1536 dimensions, cosine similarity
- **Technical**: Using new Pinecone SDK with serverless index in us-east-1

### 2025-05-09: Pinecone Vector Search Threshold Analysis
- **Issue**: Luke Skywalker content not appearing in search results despite being present in database
- **Investigation**:
  - Created test scripts to evaluate Pinecone implementation
  - Ran direct Pinecone queries bypassing adapter layer
  - Tested multiple threshold configurations (0.1-0.9)
  - Scanned index content directly for Luke/Skywalker terms
- **Findings**:
  - Found 575+ vectors containing Luke/Skywalker content in the database
  - Default similarity threshold (likely 0.7+) too high for effective retrieval
  - Best results at threshold 0.01-0.05 with scores typically 0.08-0.09
  - Direct scanning confirmed quality content exists in vectors
  - Vector IDs 12250, 12253 contain detailed Luke Skywalker biographical info
  - Embedding similarity scores lower than expected for character-specific queries
- **Solution**: 
  - Modify `PineconeVectorSearch` adapter to use lower similarity threshold (0.01-0.05)
  - Update `simple_holocron_chat.py` script for proper async/await patterns
  - Consider adding metadata filtering to supplement vector search for named characters
  - Already fixed async implementation issue in Python client code

### 2025-05-09: Pinecone Vector Database Best Practices for RAG
- **Research**: Investigated advanced Pinecone configurations for optimal RAG implementation
- **Key Learnings**:
  1. **Vector Search Improvements**:
     - Lower similarity threshold (0.01-0.05) significantly improves recall for named entities
     - Increase `top_k` parameter (50+) to retrieve more candidates before filtering
     - Consider hybrid search combining dense and sparse vectors for better results
  
  2. **Reranking Pipeline**:
     - Implement two-stage retrieval: broad vector search ‚Üí reranking
     - Use `rerank` parameter with models like `bge-reranker-v2-m3` for better precision
     - Example: `index.search(..., rerank={"model": "bge-reranker-v2-m3", "top_n": 5})`
  
  3. **Metadata Filtering**:
     - Use metadata filters to supplement vector search: `filter={"content": {"$regex": "Luke"}}`
     - Combine metadata with vector search to balance precision and recall
     - Create categorical filters for content types (e.g., character info, locations)
  
  4. **Document Chunking Strategy**:
     - Confirm our approach of overlap between chunks (100 tokens) is appropriate
     - Include entity mentions in multiple chunks for better retrieval
     - Consider shorter chunks (200-300 tokens) for more precise retrieval
  
  5. **Namespace Usage**:
     - Pinecone uses empty namespace ("") by default, not "default"
     - All our content is currently in the default empty namespace
     - Consider organizing content by categories in separate namespaces
  
  6. **Optimization Path**:
     1. Adjust similarity threshold (immediate)
     2. Add reranking for important queries
     3. Implement hybrid search for better recall
     4. Refine metadata filters for named entities
  
- **Next Steps**:
  - Test reranking implementation for character-specific queries
  - Evaluate hybrid search approach for Star Wars-specific terminology
  - Monitor and fine-tune vector search parameters based on user feedback

### 2025-05-09: Implemented Two-Stage Retrieval with Custom Reranking for Holocron Knowledge
- **Enhancement**: Developed a custom two-stage retrieval system for the Holocron Knowledge Base
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. **First-Stage Retrieval**:
     - Increased initial candidate pool from 8 to 25 vectors
     - Lowered similarity threshold to 0.01 for better recall
     - Eliminated database timeouts by migrating from Supabase to Pinecone
  
  2. **Custom Reranking Algorithm**:
     - Developed weighted multi-factor reranking system:
       - Vector similarity (60% weight) - maintains semantic relevance
       - Term matching in content (20% weight) - improves lexical matching
       - Term matching in title (15% weight) - prioritizes on-topic content
       - Category relevance (5% weight) - boosts important content types
     - Applied category-specific bonuses:
       - Character information (+5%) - improves character query responses
       - Location information (+3%) - enhances spatial context
       - Canon articles (+3%) - prioritizes official lore
  
  3. **Context Formatting Improvements**:
     - Added titles to knowledge chunks for better context
     - Included both similarity and rerank scores for debugging
     - Maintained the top 8 most relevant chunks after reranking
  
- **Results**:
  - Significantly improved retrieval quality for character-specific queries

### 2025-05-10: Fixed URL Encoding Issue in Wookieepedia Scraper
- **Issue**: URLs containing % characters were being corrupted during processing
- **Root Cause**: Character corruption occurring AFTER the % character, not the % itself
  - Example: `%Echo_Two` ‚Üí `%EF%BF%BDho_Two` (E corrupted, not %)
  - Previous fixes incorrectly focused on the % character instead of what follows it
- **Technical Fix**:
  ```python
  # Find replacement char + any valid character and restore to % + that character
  article_name = re.sub(r'\ufffd([a-zA-Z0-9_])', r'%\1', article_name)
  # Same for hex-encoded version - note the % at start of pattern
  article_name = re.sub(r'%EF%BF%BD([a-zA-Z0-9_])', r'%\1', article_name)
  ```
- **Key Insight**: Corruption affects character following % symbol, not % itself
- **Examples Fixed**:
  - `%Echo_Two` ‚Üí `%EF%BF%BDho_Two` ‚Üí restored to `%Echo_Two`
  - `%Battle_of_Castilon` ‚Üí `%EF%BF%BDttle_of_Castilon` ‚Üí restored to `%Battle_of_Castilon`

### 2025-05-11: Wookieepedia Dump Processing Pipeline Implementation
- **Overview**: Established complete pipeline for processing Wookieepedia XML dump into Holocron Knowledge Base
- **Key Components**:
  1. **XML Processing & Content Filtering** (`scripts/run_pipeline.py`):
     - Processes 674,499 total pages, 283,931 in main namespace
     - Filters to ~203,000 valid content pages
     - Classifies Canon (25,742) vs. Legends (110,076) content
     - Preserves metadata and source URLs for tracking
  
  2. **Vector Generation** (`scripts/xml_vector_processor.py`):
     - Generates embeddings for article chunks
     - Implements batch processing for efficiency
     - Creates Parquet files in `data/vectors/` directory
     - Maintains URL tracking for deduplication
  
  3. **Vector Upload** (`scripts/upload_with_url_tracking.py`):

  2. Monitor upload performance and adjust parameters if needed
  3. Verify vector quality in Pinecone index
  4. Begin integration with Holocron Knowledge System

### 2025-05-12: URL Loading Behavior in Vector Upload Pipeline
- **Issue**: Vector upload process loads all 49,449 processed URLs at startup before processing any files
- **Explanation**:
  - Design choice to prevent duplicate uploads across multiple runs
  - `ProcessStatusManager` loads complete URL history from `data/processing_status.csv`
  - Allows for:
    - Resumable uploads without duplicates
    - Parallel processing safety
    - Progress tracking across pipeline stages
  - Trade-off: Higher initial memory usage for better data consistency
- **Impact**: 
  - ~2-3 second startup delay
  - Guarantees no duplicate vectors in Pinecone index
  - Enables accurate progress reporting and error recovery
- **Alternative Considered**: 
  - Streaming URL checks would reduce memory but risk duplicates
  - Current approach preferred for data integrity

### 2025-05-12: Vector Upload Issue - All Vectors Being Skipped
- **Critical Issue**: Vector upload process skipping all vectors due to URL tracking state
- **Root Cause**:
  - `data/processing_status.csv` contains 49,449 URLs marked as processed
  - These URLs were likely marked from previous runs or testing
  - System is correctly following deduplication logic but too aggressively
- **Impact**:
  - 100% of vectors being skipped (marked as "already processed")
  - No new data making it into Pinecone index
  - Pipeline technically working but not achieving desired outcome
- **Solution**:
  1. Backup current processing_status.csv
  2. Reset URL tracking state:
     ```bash
     mv data/processing_status.csv data/processing_status.csv.bak
     ```
  3. Rerun pipeline with fresh tracking state
- **Prevention**:
  - Add command line flag to force reprocessing of URLs
  - Implement URL state reset functionality in ProcessStatusManager
  - Add better logging of URL tracking state changes

### 2025-05-12: XML Processing Pipeline Missing Content
- **Critical Issue**: Only ~50K URLs processed vs expected ~200K from Wookieepedia dump
- **Analysis**:
  - Expected: ~200K content pages (25K Canon, 110K Legends, 67K undetermined)
  - Actual: Only ~50K URLs in processing_status.csv
  - Pipeline stopping prematurely or failing to process all content
- **Investigation Points**:
  1. XML Processing Stage:
     - Check if all content is being extracted from XML dump
     - Verify Canon/Legends classification working
     - Look for silent failures in content extraction
  2. Vector Generation Stage:
     - Examine error handling in batch processing
     - Check for memory issues with large batches
     - Verify all processed content moves to vector generation
  3. Upload Stage:
     - Currently seeing only processed URLs from previous partial run
     - Need to verify full content pipeline from XML ‚Üí vectors
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Run XML processor with debug logging
  2. Add progress tracking between pipeline stages
  3. Verify content counts at each stage
  4. Fix any identified bottlenecks or failures
  5. Reprocess complete dump with monitoring

### 2025-05-12: Vector Generation Error - List Object Issue
- **Critical Issue**: Vector generation failing with "'list' object has no attribute" error
- **Root Cause**:
  - `create_vectors.py` expects single article per JSON file
  - Current XML processor outputs batch files containing arrays of articles
  - Mismatch between expected and actual JSON structure
- **Impact**:
  - All vector generation attempts failing
  - No vectors being created for upload
  - Pipeline stalled at vector generation stage
- **Solution**:
  1. Modify `process_wiki_dump.py` to save individual article files:
     ```python
     def save_batch(self, batch: list[Dict[str, Any]], batch_num: int):
         batch_dir = self.output_dir / f"batch_{batch_num:04d}"
         batch_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
         
         for article in batch:
             filename = f"{article['title'].replace('/', '_')}.json"
             file_path = batch_dir / filename
             with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                 json.dump(article, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
     ```
  2. Update vector generation to handle directory structure:
     ```python
     # Find all JSON files recursively
     json_files = list(Path(input_dir).rglob("*.json"))
     ```
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Implement these changes
  2. Clear processed_articles directory
  3. Rerun full pipeline

### 2025-05-12: Vector Generation Using Dummy Embeddings
- **Critical Issue**: Vector generation is using dummy embeddings instead of real ones
- **Root Cause**:
  - `LocalDataProcessor.process_and_upload()` is using placeholder zero vectors
  - No actual embedding generation is happening
  - All vectors are 1536-dimensional zero arrays
- **Impact**:
  - Vectors being uploaded to Pinecone are not useful for search
  - All similarity searches will return meaningless results
  - ~50K articles processed but with useless vectors
- **Solution**:
  1. Implement real embedding generation in `LocalDataProcessor`:
     ```python
     # Use OpenAI embeddings for text chunks
     embedding = await openai.embeddings.create(
         model="text-embedding-3-small",
         input=chunk_text
     )
     vector = embedding.data[0].embedding
     ```
  2. Add proper text chunking for long articles
  3. Implement error handling and rate limiting
  4. Reset processing status and reprocess all articles
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Back up current Pinecone index
  2. Implement real embedding generation
  3. Reset processing status
  4. Rerun full pipeline with real embeddings

### 2025-05-12: Vector Generation Pipeline Issues & Fix Plan
- **Current State**: Pipeline broken at vector generation stage
- **Root Issues**:
  1. File Format Mismatch:
     - XML processor outputs batch JSON files (arrays of articles)
     - Vector generator expects individual article files
  2. Embedding Generation:
     - `LocalDataProcessor` has OpenAI embedding code
     - Not being properly integrated in pipeline
- **Fix Plan**:
  1. Align File Formats:
     - Update XML processor to save individual article files
     - OR update vector generator to handle batch files
  2. Fix Embedding Integration:
     - Verify OpenAI API configuration
     - Ensure proper embedding function calls in pipeline
  3. Reset Processing:
     - Clear processed articles directory
     - Reset URL tracking state
     - Rerun pipeline with fixes
- **Expected Outcome**: Complete pipeline processing ~203K articles into proper embeddings

### 2025-05-12: Wookieepedia XML Pipeline Execution Issues
- **Critical Issue**: Pipeline failing at vector generation despite successful XML processing
- **Root Cause**: Missing URL field in XML processor output
  - XML processor's `ArticleData` class doesn't include URL field
  - Vector generator requires URL for chunk ID generation and metadata
  - Results in "No records generated for batch" for all batches
- **Impact**: 
  - ~201K articles processed from XML

- **Next Steps**:
  1. Add URL field to `ArticleData` class in XML processor
  2. Generate consistent URLs from article titles
  3. Update vector generator to handle XML-sourced articles
  4. Test with small sample before full processing

### 2025-05-12: Fixed XML Pipeline URL Field Issue
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Added URL field to `ArticleData` class in process_wiki_dump.py
  - Added URL generation from article titles in standard Wookieepedia format:
    ```python
    url_title = title.replace(' ', '_').replace('/', '_').replace('\\', '_')
    url = f"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/{url_title}"
    ```
  - Enhanced vector generator's error logging to better identify missing content or URL issues

  ```

### 2025-05-14: Refined Rate Limit Handling for Vector Creation
After observing excessive rate limit hits with our previously optimized settings, we've implemented a more sophisticated token-based rate limiting system in `scripts/create_vectors_robust.py`:

1. Reduced concurrent API requests from 15 to 2
2. Reduced embedding batch size from 200 to 25
3. Implemented token-based budget system to stay under OpenAI's rate limits
4. Added active monitoring of token usage rate over a 60-second sliding window
5. Added adaptive delay between batches based on current token rate
6. Target token rate set to 250K tokens/minute (safely under OpenAI's 300K limit)

The script now pre-calculates token usage before making API calls and dynamically adjusts its pacing to prevent hitting rate limits. It also records actual token usage from the API responses for accurate rate calculations. This approach aims to maximize throughput while avoiding rate limit errors.

**Update:** Initial testing confirms the new rate limiting system is working well with no observable rate limit errors.

### 2025-05-14: Vector Creation Script Optimization and Rate Limit Handling

     - Added 60-second sliding window for token rate tracking
  2. **Dynamic Pacing**:
     - Implemented token-based budget system
     - Added adaptive delays based on current token usage:
       - 70%+ of limit: 2.0s delay
       - 50-70% of limit: 1.0s delay
       - Below 50%: 0.5s delay
  3. **Improved Monitoring**:
     - Real-time token rate calculation
     - Progress tracking with ETA
     - Detailed performance metrics logging
  4. **Resilience**:
     - Enhanced error handling with exponential backoff
     - Graceful shutdown support with progress saving
     - Resumable processing with --start-file parameter

  - Average chunk size: 2000-2500 tokens (4x larger than intended)
  - Causing ~5x more API calls and cost than necessary
  - Improper text boundary handling due to word-based splits
- **Technical Fix**:
  - Implemented proper token-based chunking using tiktoken
  - Reduced chunk size to 256 tokens (from 512)
  - Reduced overlap to 64 tokens (from 128)
  - Using exact same tokenizer as OpenAI API for consistency
- **Benefits**:
  - Expected 80% reduction in API costs
  - More efficient processing with proper chunk sizes
  - Better text boundary handling with proper tokenization
  - Improved RAG retrieval quality with consistent chunk sizes
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Delete existing vectors from Pinecone index

  - Examined metadata for token count indicators
- **Findings**:
  - Current vectors have reasonable token sizes (mostly 0-500 tokens)
  - Mean token count: ~82 tokens per chunk
  - Median token count: ~56 tokens
  - No chunks found with >2000 tokens
  - Most vectors include proper 'content_tokens' metadata
- **Conclusion**:
  - The chunking issue appears to have been resolved before vectors were uploaded to Pinecone
  - Current vectors use token-based chunking rather than word-based
  - The average token count (82) aligns with the intended size after optimization
  - No evidence of excessive token counts in the current vector database
- **Next Steps**:
