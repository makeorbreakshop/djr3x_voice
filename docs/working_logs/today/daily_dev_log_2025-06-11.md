# DJ R3X Voice App — Working Dev Log (2025-06-11)
- Focus on fixing dashboard NOW PLAYING section not updating when music commands sent
- Goal is to restore track display functionality with proper timing and control integration

## 📌 Project Overview
DJ R3X is an animatronic character from Star Wars that operates as a DJ at Oga's Cantina. This project recreates the voice and animation features with interactive conversations and synchronized LED animations.

### NOW PLAYING Dashboard Fix - DATA UNWRAPPING SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
**Time**: 07:30  
**Goal**: Fix dashboard NOW PLAYING section not updating despite successful music commands  
**Problem**: Dashboard showed "No track selected. Choose a track from the library below." even when music was playing successfully in backend  

**Investigation Results**:
- ✅ **Backend Music Playback**: MusicController correctly playing tracks and emitting MUSIC_PLAYBACK_STARTED events
- ✅ **WebBridge Event Broadcasting**: Successfully broadcasting music_status events to frontend clients
- ✅ **Socket.IO Connection**: Dashboard clients connecting and subscribing to music events properly  
- ❌ **Frontend Event Processing**: music_status events not updating React state despite being received

**Root Cause Analysis**:
Backend logs showed successful event flow:
```
[MusicController] Emitting MUSIC_PLAYBACK_STARTED with payload: {'track': {...}, 'source': 'cli', 'mode': 'IDLE'}
[WebBridge] Broadcasting music_status event: {'action': 'started', 'track': {...}, 'source': 'cli', 'mode': 'IDLE'}
```

But frontend music_status handlers weren't unwrapping event data like other handlers that used `const unwrappedData = data.data || data` pattern.

**Technical Fixes Applied**:
1. **useSocket.ts Hook** (lines 150-155):
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (BROKEN):
   newSocket.on('music_status', (data: MusicStatus) => {
     setMusicStatus(data)
   })
   
   // AFTER (FIXED):
   newSocket.on('music_status', (data: MusicStatus) => {
     const unwrappedData = (data as any).data || data
     console.log('🎵 [useSocket] Music status received:', data)
     console.log('🎵 [useSocket] Unwrapped music status:', unwrappedData)
     setMusicStatus(unwrappedData)
   })
   ```

2. **MusicTab.tsx Component** (lines 46-83):
   ```typescript
   const handleMusicStatus = (data: MusicStatus) => {
     // Handle data unwrapping like other event handlers
     const unwrappedData = (data as any).data || data
     console.log('🎵 [MusicTab] Music status update received:', data)
     console.log('🎵 [MusicTab] Unwrapped data:', unwrappedData)
     
     if (unwrappedData.action === 'started') {
       setIsPlaying(true)
       if (unwrappedData.track) {
         // Create track object from unwrapped data
         const track: Track = {
           id: unwrappedData.track.track_id || unwrappedData.track.title || '',
           title: unwrappedData.track.title || '',
           artist: unwrappedData.track.artist || 'Unknown Artist',
           duration: unwrappedData.track.duration ? `${Math.floor(unwrappedData.track.duration / 60)}:${String(Math.floor(unwrappedData.track.duration % 60)).padStart(2, '0')}` : '0:00',
           file: filename,
           path: unwrappedData.track.filepath || ''
         }
         setCurrentTrack(track)
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Data Structure Analysis**:
The backend event structure required unwrapping:
```typescript
// Received: { data: { action: 'started', track: {...} } }
// Needed: { action: 'started', track: {...} }
```

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ NOW PLAYING section updates when music tracks selected
- ✅ Track title, artist, and duration display correctly  
- ✅ Playback controls (play/pause/stop/next) all functional
- ✅ Current track highlighting in music library working
- ✅ Consistent with other dashboard event handlers (voice_status, system_status, etc.)

**Impact**: Dashboard NOW PLAYING section fully functional - users can see current track info and use playback controls properly  
**Learning**: Socket.IO event data unwrapping must be applied consistently across all event handlers to prevent React state update failures  
**Result**: NOW PLAYING Dashboard Fix - **TRACK DISPLAY FULLY RESTORED** ✅
