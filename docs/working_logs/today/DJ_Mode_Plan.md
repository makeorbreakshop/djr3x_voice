# DJ Mode Implementation Plan

## üéØ Concept Overview
DJ R3X will function as an autonomous DJ that:
- Plays through music tracks automatically with intelligent sequencing
- Provides DJ-style introductions for upcoming tracks
- Creates smooth crossfades between songs
- Continues operating in the background without user input

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### New Components
1. **CachedSpeechService**
   - Pre-renders speech for precise timing control
   - Provides exact speech duration information
   - Enables synchronized music/voice transitions
   - Implements lookahead caching for transitions (current + next track)

### Modified Components
1. **MusicControllerService**
   - Add crossfade capability between tracks
   - Support pre-loading of next track
   - Expose track metadata for better transitions
   - Add methods to get precise track progress/remaining time
   - Emit TRACK_ENDING_SOON events when track nears completion

2. **BrainService**
   - Generate plans for DJ mode transitions (just-in-time planning)
   - Implement intelligent track sequencing algorithms
   - Generate track-specific transition commentary
   - Handle DJ CLI commands (next, stop, etc.)
   - Create transition plans for skip commands

3. **TimelineExecutorService**
   - Support coordinated transitions between tracks
   - Handle speech/music synchronization with precise timing
   - Manage layer transitions during crossfades

4. **MemoryService**
   - Store DJ mode state (active/inactive)
   - Track current playlist and play history
   - Remember user preferences and skip patterns
   - Maintain lookahead cache state

## üîÑ Event Flow for DJ Mode

```
[DJ Mode Active]
        |
        v
[Current Track Playing]
        |
        v
[TRACK_ENDING_SOON] (30 seconds before end)
        |
        v
[BrainService selects next track]
        |
        v
[Generate transition commentary with CachedSpeechService]
        |
        v
[Cache next transition for potential skip commands]
        |
        v
[Pre-load next track]
        |
        v
[Start crossfade]
        |
        v
[Play DJ transition commentary during crossfade]
        |
        v
[Complete transition to new track]
        |
        v
[Return to ambient DJ state]
```

## üîÑ CLI Skip Command Flow

```
[DJ_NEXT command received]
        |
        v
[Check if next transition is cached]
        |
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Yes] Use cached transition
        |         |
        |         v
        |     [Execute skip plan]
        |
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [No] Generate transition on-demand
                |

## üö© Expected Challenges
1. **Speech Timing Precision**: Ensuring DJ commentary aligns perfectly with musical transitions
2. **Resource Management**: Handling memory usage with pre-cached audio files
3. **Musical Flow**: Creating algorithms that select tracks with complementary musical qualities
4. **Stability**: Ensuring the system can run for hours without degradation
5. **Content Variety**: Preventing repetitive DJ commentary over extended sessions
6. **Lookahead Cache Management**: Balancing responsiveness with resource usage

## üîß Technical Requirements
- ElevenLabs API direct integration (non-streaming)
- Audio buffer and track analysis capability
- Thread-safe cache management
- Event-driven architecture compatible with existing timeline services
- Precise audio timing for crossfades

This implementation plan leverages our existing layered timeline architecture by using BrainService as the primary plan generator, MemoryService for state tracking, and TimelineExecutorService for coordinated execution. The lookahead caching approach balances responsiveness with resource efficiency.
