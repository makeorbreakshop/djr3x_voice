# DJ R3X Voice App ‚Äî Working Dev Log (2025-05-20)
- This gets refreshed daily and the core info is saved to `dj-r3x-condensed-dev-log.md`
- Goal is to give cursor good active context for what we are working on.

## üìå Project Overview
DJ R3X is an animatronic character from Star Wars that operates as a DJ at Oga's Cantina. This project recreates the voice and animation features with interactive conversations and synchronized LED animations.

## [10:15] Issue #42: GPTService Timeout During Long Responses

**Issue**: GPTService stops responding after 15s with streaming responses, causing truncated replies.
```
2025-05-20 10:03:21,395 - cantina_os.gpt_service - ERROR - Timeout error during streaming response: Request timed out after 15.0s
```

**Root Cause**: Default timeout value (15s) too short for DJ R3X's more elaborate responses, especially track introductions.

**Changes**:
- Updated `gpt_service.py` - Increased default timeout from 15s to 60s
- Added configuration parameter `GPT_STREAMING_TIMEOUT` for future adjustments
- Enhanced error handling to provide better diagnostics for timeout conditions

**Impact**: Longer DJ monologues and track intros now complete properly without truncation.

**Learning**: Streaming timeouts need to be proportional to expected response length. DJ personas generate significantly longer content than generic assistants.

**Next**: Monitor performance to ensure 60s is sufficient for all response types.

## [11:30] Issue #42: Update - Improved Timeout Handling

**Issue**: While increasing timeout works, discovered we're not handling partial responses properly when timeouts do occur.

**Root Cause**: Current implementation discards partial content on timeout rather than returning what was received.

**Changes**:
- Modified `_stream_gpt_response()` in `gpt_service.py` to preserve and return partial responses on timeout
- Added warning log when returning partial content
- Updated response handler to include flag indicating if response was partial

**Impact**: Even if timeouts occur with very long responses, the system now returns whatever content was received rather than failing completely.

**Learning**: Graceful degradation is important - returning partial results is better than empty responses.

**Next**: Implement test case to verify partial response handling.

## [14:22] Feature #43: DJ Mode Pattern Recognition

**Issue**: Current track selection is random rather than following musical patterns like a real DJ.

**Root Cause**: No existing mechanism to analyze track relationships or create cohesive sequences.

**Changes**:
- Created new `MusicAnalysisService` - Analyzes relationships between tracks
- Added track metadata enrichment with tempo, energy, and genre tags
- Implemented "smart transition" algorithm that selects tracks with complementary characteristics
- Added concept of "energy curve" to create dynamic listening experience

**Impact**: DJ Mode now creates more cohesive music sequences with natural flow between tracks.

**Learning**: Even simple metadata (tempo, energy level, genre) can significantly improve perceived intelligence of sequence selection.

**Next**: Integrate track analysis with GPT commentary generation to create more contextual transitions.

## [16:05] Bug #44: ElevenLabs Connection Error Handling

**Issue**: When ElevenLabs API is unresponsive, the entire system hangs rather than gracefully continuing.
```
2025-05-20 15:58:32,104 - cantina_os.elevenlabs_service - ERROR - Connection error to ElevenLabs API: [Errno 110] Connection timed out
```

**Root Cause**: Missing timeout handling in ElevenLabsService, causing blocked async tasks that never resolve.

**Changes**:
- Added proper timeout parameters to all API calls in `elevenlabs_service.py`
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated failed calls
- Added fallback to local TTS when ElevenLabs unavailable
- Created auto-retry mechanism with exponential backoff

**Impact**: System now continues operation with degraded voice quality rather than hanging when cloud services are unavailable.

**Learning**: External API calls always need timeout, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms for robustness.

**Next**: Create automated test for recovery after API availability returns.

## [17:30] Refactor #45: Improved Event Payload Standardization

**Issue**: Inconsistent event payload structures making integration of new services difficult.

**Root Cause**: Lack of centralized payload definitions and validation.

**Changes**:
- Created centralized `event_schemas.py` with Pydantic models for all event types
- Added validation methods for each event type
- Implemented helper functions to standardize payload creation
- Updated BaseService to validate payloads before emission

**Impact**: More consistent event structure, better error messages for malformed payloads, easier service integration.

**Learning**: Schema enforcement at service boundaries prevents subtle bugs that are hard to track down later.

**Next**: Update existing services to use the new schema definitions.

### 2025-06-16: Music Track Duration Display Issue - **ATTEMPTED** ‚ùå
- **Issue**: All tracks in dashboard showing hardcoded "3:00" duration instead of actual length
- **Root Cause**: API endpoint `/api/music/library` not returning actual track duration metadata
- **Analysis**: Frontend expects duration in seconds, converts to MM:SS format at line 136
- **Attempted Solution**: Modified music library API to extract actual duration using ffprobe subprocess
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Updated `/api/music/library` endpoint to call ffprobe for each audio file
  - Added fallback to 3:00 if ffprobe fails or is unavailable
  - Enhanced music_playback_started event to include duration and start_timestamp
- **Result**: Solution did not work - likely ffprobe not available or subprocess failing silently
- **Next Steps**: Need to investigate why ffprobe approach failed, consider using Python audio library instead
