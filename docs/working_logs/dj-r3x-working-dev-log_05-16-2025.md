# DJ R3X Voice App â€” Working Dev Log (Engineering Journal)
- This gets refreshed daily and the core info is saved to `dj-r3x-condensed-dev-log.md`
- Goal is to give cursor good active context for what we are working on.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
DJ R3X is an animatronic character from Star Wars that operates as a DJ at Oga's Cantina. This project recreates the voice and animation features with interactive conversations and synchronized LED animations.

## [2025-05-16] IntentRouter Feature Implementation Complete

### Overview
Successfully completed the implementation and testing of the IntentRouter feature, which enables DJ R3X to both respond conversationally to voice commands and execute the requested actions. The feature is now fully tested and documented.

### Key Files
- [IntentRouter Feature Log](docs/featurelog/IntentRouter_Featurelog.md): Detailed documentation of the feature implementation
- [IntentRouter TODO](docs/featurelog/IntentRouter_TODO.md): Implementation checklist and progress tracking

### Integration Test Fixes
1. **Event Handling Improvements**:
   - Fixed critical issues in BaseService's event handling:
     - Updated `emit()` method to properly await event bus emissions
     - Updated `subscribe()` method to properly await event bus subscriptions
     - Resolved race conditions in the event pipeline

2. **Test Approach Enhancement**:
   - Identified and fixed issues with test mocking strategy:
     - Switched from mocking `_get_gpt_response` to `_process_with_gpt`
     - Implemented proper simulation of GPT responses with tool calls
     - Added robust test fixtures that properly initialize services

3. **Event Topic Alignment**:
   - Fixed event topic usage in tests:
     - Corrected progression: TRANSCRIPTION_TEXT â†’ TRANSCRIPTION_FINAL â†’ VOICE_LISTENING_STOPPED
     - Aligned test events with production event flow
     - Added proper event validation

### Test Coverage Achievements
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - GPTService function calling capabilities
   - IntentRouterService intent handling
   - Parameter validation and transformation
   - Error handling and edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end flow from voice transcript to hardware commands
   - Multiple intent handling in single requests
   - Invalid parameter handling
   - No-intent scenarios

### Documentation Updates
1. **Feature Log Updates**:
   - Added detailed testing implementation section
   - Documented challenges overcome and solutions implemented
   - Updated test coverage information

2. **TODO List Progress**:
   - Marked all integration tests as completed
   - Updated acceptance criteria to reflect passing tests
   - Documented remaining tasks (user documentation)

### Next Steps
1. Create user documentation for supported voice commands
2. Monitor system logs for any edge cases in production
3. Consider implementing post-MVP enhancements:
   - Intent confidence scoring
   - Multi-step command support
   - Enhanced parameter validation

The IntentRouter feature is now fully implemented, tested, and ready for production use. The implementation maintains clean separation between conversational responses and machine actions while providing a natural voice interface for controlling DJ R3X's hardware functions.
