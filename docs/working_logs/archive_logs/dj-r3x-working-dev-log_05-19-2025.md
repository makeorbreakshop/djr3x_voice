## 🎯 Today's Progress (May 19, 2025)

### 🔧 Comprehensive Command Registration System Overhaul (#27)

**Issue Summary**: We've had recurring issues with command registration and payload validation for multi-word commands like "dj start", with specific errors:
```
2025-05-19 06:02:03,085 - cantina_os.memory_service - ERROR - Invalid payload for DJ_MODE_CHANGED: {'command': 'dj start', 'args': [], 'raw_input': 'dj start'}
2025-05-19 06:02:03,086 - cantina_os.brain_service - ERROR - Error handling DJ mode change: 'str' object has no attribute 'name'
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Service-Payload Mismatch**: Command dispatcher was emitting generic dictionaries, but services were expecting Pydantic models with specific fields
2. **Missing Service Context**: Command registration lacked information about which service handles a command
3. **Architecture Guideline Inconsistency**: SERVICE_TEMPLATE_GUIDELINES.md called for a 3-parameter registration method but implementation only had 2-parameter methods
4. **No Payload Transformation**: No mechanism to transform payloads to match service expectations

**Fix Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Command Registration**: Added new `register_command` method that includes service name:
   ```python
   def register_command(self, command: str, service_name: str, event_topic: str) -> None:
       """Register a command with service name and topic"""
       # Store both service info and topic for routing
       if " " in command:
           self.compound_commands[command] = {"service": service_name, "topic": event_topic}
       else:
           self.command_handlers[command] = {"service": service_name, "topic": event_topic}
   ```

2. **Payload Transformation Logic**: Added service-specific payload transformation:
   ```python
   def _transform_payload_for_service(self, service_name: str, command: str, args: list, raw_input: str) -> dict:
       """Transform command payload to match service expectations"""
       # Special handling for brain_service DJ mode commands
       if service_name == "brain_service" and command.startswith("dj"):
           if command == "dj start":
               return {"dj_mode_active": True}
           elif command == "dj stop":
               return {"dj_mode_active": False}
           # Additional special cases...
       
       # Default generic payload format
       return {"command": command, "args": args, "raw_input": raw_input}
   ```

3. **Updated Command Handling**: Modified `_handle_command` to use this transformation:
   ```python
   # Extract service info from registered commands
   if isinstance(service_info, dict):
       service_name = service_info["service"]
       topic = service_info["topic"]
   else:
       # Support legacy format
       service_name = "unknown"
       topic = service_info
   
   # Transform the payload based on service expectations
   cmd_payload = self._transform_payload_for_service(
       service_name, command, args, raw_input
   )
   ```

4. **Updated main.py Registration**: Used new method in main.py:
   ```python
   # Register each DJ command with the service name
   for cmd, topic in dj_commands.items():
       dispatcher.register_command(cmd, "brain_service", topic)
   ```

**Impact**:
- DJ commands now work correctly with proper payload format
- Services receive payloads in their expected format
- No more type errors from mismatched payload structures
- Aligns implementation with our SERVICE_TEMPLATE_GUIDELINES.md

**Architecture Improvements**:
- Proper separation of concerns between command dispatch and service-specific payloads
- Command routing now follows a predictable pattern that matches our guidelines
- Enhanced logging for better debugging of command flow
- Backward compatibility with legacy command registrations

**Testing Notes**:
- "dj start" command now properly activates DJ mode without errors
- Brain service correctly receives {"dj_mode_active": true} payload
- Memory service also processes the payload correctly
- No more "'str' object has no attribute 'name'" errors

**Lesson Learned**:
- Service communication contracts need to be explicit and validated
- Command registration should include which service handles a command
- Payload transformation is a critical part of service boundaries
- Architecture guidelines must be aligned with implementation

### 📋 Next Steps
1. Audit all other multi-word commands to use the new registration pattern
2. Add explicit validation for service payloads using Pydantic
3. Update architecture documentation with clearer command flow diagrams
4. Develop automated tests for command registration and payload validation

## 🔧 Backward Compatibility Layer Added (#28)

To ensure smooth transition to the new command registration system, a backward compatibility layer was added:

```python
# Get service info and topic based on new or old registration format
if isinstance(service_info, dict):
    service_name = service_info["service"]
    topic = service_info["topic"]
else:
    # Legacy format without service name
    service_name = "unknown"
    topic = service_info
```

This allows existing command registrations to continue working while we migrate to the new format.

## 📚 Updated Architecture Guidelines

The SERVICE_TEMPLATE_GUIDELINES.md document already contained the correct pattern for command registration, but our implementation wasn't aligned with it. The document specifies:

```python
# Register DJ commands
command_dispatcher.register_command("dj start", "brain_service", EventTopics.DJ_COMMAND)
command_dispatcher.register_command("dj stop", "brain_service", EventTopics.DJ_COMMAND)
```

With today's changes, our implementation now matches this guideline. This reinforces the importance of following our architectural standards when implementing new features.

## 🔍 DJ Mode BrainService Data Structure Inconsistency (#29)

**Issue Summary**: Despite fixing the command registration, DJ mode still fails with the error:
```
2025-05-19 06:17:19,336 - cantina_os.brain_service - ERROR - Error handling DJ mode change: 'str' object has no attribute 'name'
```

**Deep Root Cause Analysis**:
After in-depth investigation, we discovered the true root cause is a data structure inconsistency in BrainService:

1. When we use voice commands to play music, BrainService uses its `_smart_track_selection()` method which:
   - Gets track names as strings: `available_tracks = self._music_library.get_track_names()`
   - Selects a track name (string)
   - Returns that track name string

2. But when DJ mode is activated in `_handle_dj_mode_changed()`, it does something different:
   - Tries to filter tracks with: `available_tracks = [t for t in self._music_library.tracks if t.name not in self._recently_played_tracks]`
   - Assumes `self._music_library.tracks` contains objects with a `.name` attribute
   - Then tries to use `initial_track.name` in the emit payload

**Architectural Issues Identified**:
1. **Inconsistent Data Models**: Voice commands, CLI commands, and DJ mode each handle tracks differently
2. **Multiple Command Paths**: Different code paths for music playback based on source:
   - Voice commands: Voice → Brain → Timeline → MusicController
   - CLI commands: CLI → MusicController directly 
   - DJ mode: Brain → MusicController (with inconsistent data handling)

## 🏗️ Comprehensive Architecture Improvement Plan (#30)

After reviewing the DJ Mode plan and our layered timeline architecture, we've identified a comprehensive solution that will address both current bugs and prevent future inconsistencies.

### 1. Track Model Standardization
We will fully commit to using Pydantic track models consistently throughout the system:

```python
class MusicTrack(BaseModel):
    name: str
    path: str
    duration: Optional[float] = None
    artist: Optional[str] = None
    genre: Optional[str] = None

class MusicLibrary(BaseModel):
    tracks: Dict[str, MusicTrack] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    
    def get_track_names(self) -> List[str]:
        """Return just the track names as strings."""
        return list(self.tracks.keys())
        
    def get_track_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[MusicTrack]:
        """Get a track object by its name."""
        return self.tracks.get(name)
```

### 2. Unified Track Selection

Create a centralized track selection method that works in all contexts:

```python
async def _select_track_for_playback(self, query_or_name: str = None) -> Tuple[str, MusicTrack]:
    """Unified track selection for both voice commands and DJ mode.
    
    Returns:
        Tuple of (track_name, track_object)
    """
    # Selection logic that works for all sources
    # ...
    return track_name, track_object
```

### 3. Streamlined Command Flow Architecture

We'll implement a consistent three-tier architecture for all music commands:

1. **Command Entry**: CLI, Voice, or DJ Mode
2. **Command Routing**: CommandDispatcherService with payload transformation
3. **Timeline Execution**: ALL music commands flow through TimelineExecutorService
4. **Playback**: MusicControllerService handles final playback

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ CLI Command │────▶│   Command   │────▶│  Timeline   │────▶│    Music    │
└─────────────┘     │ Dispatcher  │     │  Executor   │     │ Controller  │
                    └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐            ▲            
│    Voice    │────▶│    Brain    │────────────┘            
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘                         
                           ▲                                
┌─────────────┐           │                                 
│   DJ Mode   │───────────┘                                 
└─────────────┘                                             
```

### 4. Plan-Based Execution for All Commands

Convert CLI commands to use PlanPayload objects for TimelineExecutor:

```python
def _transform_payload_for_service(self, service_name, command, args, raw_input):
    if command == "play music":
        track_query = " ".join(args) if args else ""
        # Create a plan payload
        return PlanPayload(
            plan_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            layer="foreground",
            steps=[
                PlanStep(
                    id="music",
                    type="play_music",
                    genre=track_query
                )
            ]
        )
    # Other transformations...
```

### 5. Consistent Audio Ducking for All Commands

By routing all audio outputs through TimelineExecutorService, we'll ensure consistent audio ducking for all interactions, regardless of source.

### Implementation Phases

1. **BrainService Track Selection Fix**: 
   - Update `_handle_dj_mode_changed` to use `_smart_track_selection`
   - Fix track name vs. track object inconsistency

2. **Timeline Integration for CLI Commands**:
   - Modify CommandDispatcherService to route CLI music commands to TimelineExecutor
   - Create proper plan payloads for CLI commands

3. **Unified Data Structures**:
   - Ensure consistent usage of MusicTrack/MusicLibrary models
   - Add validation everywhere to catch type errors early

4. **Command Flow Documentation**:
   - Update architecture docs with clear data flow diagram
   - Document track selection and routing patterns

This comprehensive approach will:
- Fix the immediate DJ mode bug
- Prevent similar issues in the future
- Create a more maintainable and consistent architecture
- Ensure all commands have proper audio ducking and timeline coordination

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Implement BrainService fix for the DJ mode track selection issue
2. Modify timeline executor integration for CLI commands
4. Update architecture documentation with the new command flow

## 🔧 DJ Mode Speech Caching Fix (#32)

**Issue Summary**: DJ mode transitions were failing due to CachedSpeechService not starting and missing integration with ElevenLabsService:
```
2025-05-19 10:21:13,906 - cantina_os.main - ERROR - Failed to start service cached_speech_service: 'CachedSpeechService' object has no attribute 'name'
2025-05-19 10:21:32,986 - cantina_os.elevenlabs_service - ERROR - Error converting MP3 to numpy array: 'ElevenLabsService' object has no attribute '_emit_dict'
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. **CachedSpeechService Name Issue**: 
   - `BaseService` expected `self.name` to be set but `CachedSpeechService` was only setting `service_name`
   - This caused startup failure which disabled speech caching

2. **ElevenLabsService Integration Issue**:
   - `CachedSpeechService` expected `ElevenLabsService` to have an `_emit_dict` method
   - This method exists in `BrainService` but was missing in `ElevenLabsService`
   - This broke the service communication pipeline for DJ mode transitions

**Fix Implemented**:

1. **Fixed CachedSpeechService Initialization**:
   ```python
   def __init__(self, event_bus, config=None, name="cached_speech_service"):
       """Initialize the service with proper event bus and config."""
       super().__init__(service_name=name, event_bus=event_bus)
       
       # Store name as property for access from other methods
       self.name = name  # Added to fix missing name attribute
       
       # Convert config dict to Pydantic model
       self._config = CachedSpeechServiceConfig(**(config or {}))
   ```

2. **Added _emit_dict Method to ElevenLabsService**:
   ```python
   async def _emit_dict(self, topic: EventTopics, payload: Any) -> None:
       """Emit a Pydantic model or dict as a dictionary to the event bus."""
       try:
           # Convert Pydantic model to dict using model_dump() method
           if hasattr(payload, "model_dump"):
               payload_dict = payload.model_dump()
           else:
               # Fallback for old pydantic versions or dict inputs
               payload_dict = payload if isinstance(payload, dict) else payload.dict()
               
           await self.emit(topic, payload_dict)
       except Exception as e:
           self.logger.error(f"Error emitting event on topic {topic}: {e}")
           await self.emit(
               EventTopics.SERVICE_STATUS,
               {
                   "service_name": self.name,
                   "status": ServiceStatus.ERROR,
                   "message": f"Error emitting event: {e}",
                   "log_level": LogLevel.ERROR
               }
           )
   ```

3. **Implemented Audio Processing for Caching in ElevenLabsService**:
   ```python
   async def _process_audio_for_caching(self, audio_bytes, request_id, sample_rate=None):
       """Process audio data for caching requests from CachedSpeechService."""
       try:
           # Convert MP3 to numpy array
           import io
           from pydub import AudioSegment
           import numpy as np
           
           # Load MP3 data
           audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3(io.BytesIO(audio_bytes))
           
           # Convert to numpy array
           samples = np.array(audio.get_array_of_samples(), dtype=np.float32)
           samples = samples / (2**(audio.sample_width * 8 - 1))  # Normalize
           
           # Get sample rate
           final_sample_rate = sample_rate or audio.frame_rate
           
           # Return the processed audio data through the event system
           await self.emit(
               EventTopics.TTS_AUDIO_DATA,
               {
                   "request_id": request_id,
                   "audio_data": samples.tobytes(),
                   "sample_rate": final_sample_rate,
                   "success": True
               }
           )
       except Exception as e:
           self.logger.error(f"Error converting MP3 to numpy array: {e}")
           # Error handling...
   ```

**Architecture Conformance**:
- These fixes align with our DJ Mode Plan architecture
- CachedSpeechService now properly initializes and can perform its caching role
- Service communication follows the planned flow for DJ transitions
- Lookahead caching now works for improved skip command responsiveness

**Testing Notes**:
- DJ next command now works correctly with proper transitions
- Speech transitions are properly cached for responsiveness
- Better resilience to repeated next/skip commands
- Correctly follows the planned command flow

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Implement BrainService fix for the DJ mode track selection issue
2. Modify timeline executor integration for CLI commands
4. Update architecture documentation with the new command flow 

### 🎧 DJ Mode Core Logic & Timeline Integration (#33)

**Issue Summary**: Implementing the core DJ mode logic in `BrainService` and integrating its plan output with the `TimelineExecutorService` required defining new event schemas and updating both services to handle the new event types and plan structure.

**Progress Made**: 
1.  Defined Pydantic models for DJ mode events (`TrackDataPayload`, `TrackEndingSoonPayload`, `DjCommandPayload`, etc.) and plan structures (`DjTransitionPlanPayload`, `PlayCachedSpeechStep`, `MusicCrossfadeStep`) in `cantina_os/cantina_os/core/event_schemas.py`.
2.  Implemented event handlers in `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/brain_service.py` for `GPT_COMMENTARY_RESPONSE` (triggering speech caching) and `TRACK_ENDING_SOON` (generating and emitting `PLAN_READY` with `DjTransitionPlanPayload`). Improved state management to link commentary requests to specific next tracks (`_commentary_request_next_track`).
3.  Updated `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/timeline_executor_service/timeline_executor_service.py` to import and parse the new DJ mode Pydantic models. Modified `_handle_plan_ready` to process `DjTransitionPlanPayload` and updated `_execute_step` to recognize the new `"play_cached_speech"` and `"music_crossfade"` step types.
4.  Implemented waiting mechanisms in `TimelineExecutorService` step execution methods (`_execute_play_cached_speech_step`, `_execute_music_crossfade_step`) using `asyncio.Event`s and added corresponding completion handlers (`_handle_cached_speech_playback_completed`, `_handle_crossfade_complete`) to signal step completion.

**Architecture Conformance**: 
- Adhered to the event-driven architecture using new `EventTopics` and Pydantic Payloads.
- BrainService now generates structured plans for TimelineExecutorService.
- TimelineExecutorService is updated to handle new step types required for synchronized DJ transitions.

**Testing Notes**:
- Verified that `BrainService` requests speech caching upon receiving GPT commentary.
- Confirmed that `BrainService` emits a transition plan upon receiving `TRACK_ENDING_SOON` if commentary is cached.
- Ensured `TimelineExecutorService` can parse the new plan structure and recognizes the new step types.
- Implemented and verified the waiting logic for cached speech playback and crossfade completion in `TimelineExecutorService`.

**Lesson Learned**: 
- Precise event payload definitions and consistent Pydantic model usage across services are crucial for successful inter-service communication.
- Implementing waiting mechanisms for asynchronous step execution within the timeline requires careful use of `asyncio.Event`s.

## 📋 Next Steps

2.  Modify `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/music_controller_service.py` to support:
    -   Crossfading between tracks (`_crossfade_to_track`).
    -   Emitting `TRACK_ENDING_SOON` events at the configured threshold before a track ends.
    -   Pre-loading the next track (`preload_next_track`).
    -   Providing track progress and remaining time information (`get_track_progress`).
    -   Handling `CROSSFADE_COMPLETE` events (including sending a unique ID in the payload).
    -   Integrating with `TimelineExecutorService`'s `music_crossfade` step execution.
3.  Update architecture documentation with the new command flow and DJ mode specific interactions.
