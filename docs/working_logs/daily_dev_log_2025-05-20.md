## [10:15] Issue #42: GPTService Timeout During Long Responses

**Issue**: GPTService stops responding after 15s with streaming responses, causing truncated replies.
```
2025-05-20 10:03:21,395 - cantina_os.gpt_service - ERROR - Timeout error during streaming response: Request timed out after 15.0s
```

**Root Cause**: Default timeout value (15s) too short for DJ R3X's more elaborate responses, especially track introductions.

**Changes**:
- Updated `gpt_service.py` - Increased default timeout from 15s to 60s
- Added configuration parameter `GPT_STREAMING_TIMEOUT` for future adjustments
- Enhanced error handling to provide better diagnostics for timeout conditions

**Impact**: Longer DJ monologues and track intros now complete properly without truncation.

**Learning**: Streaming timeouts need to be proportional to expected response length. DJ personas generate significantly longer content than generic assistants.

**Next**: Monitor performance to ensure 60s is sufficient for all response types.

---

## [11:30] Issue #42: Update - Improved Timeout Handling

**Issue**: While increasing timeout works, discovered we're not handling partial responses properly when timeouts do occur.

**Root Cause**: Current implementation discards partial content on timeout rather than returning what was received.

**Changes**:
- Modified `_stream_gpt_response()` in `gpt_service.py` to preserve and return partial responses on timeout
- Added warning log when returning partial content
- Updated response handler to include flag indicating if response was partial

**Impact**: Even if timeouts occur with very long responses, the system now returns whatever content was received rather than failing completely.

**Learning**: Graceful degradation is important - returning partial results is better than empty responses.

**Next**: Implement test case to verify partial response handling.

---

## [14:22] Feature #43: DJ Mode Pattern Recognition

**Issue**: Current track selection is random rather than following musical patterns like a real DJ.

**Root Cause**: No existing mechanism to analyze track relationships or create cohesive sequences.

**Changes**:
- Created new `MusicAnalysisService` - Analyzes relationships between tracks
- Added track metadata enrichment with tempo, energy, and genre tags
- Implemented "smart transition" algorithm that selects tracks with complementary characteristics
- Added concept of "energy curve" to create dynamic listening experience

**Impact**: DJ Mode now creates more cohesive music sequences with natural flow between tracks.

**Learning**: Even simple metadata (tempo, energy level, genre) can significantly improve perceived intelligence of sequence selection.

**Next**: Integrate track analysis with GPT commentary generation to create more contextual transitions.

## [16:05] Bug: TimelineExecutorService Startup Error (CROSSFADE_COMPLETE)

**Issue**: `TimelineExecutorService` failed to start with an `AttributeError: type object 'EventTopics' has no attribute 'CROSSFADE_COMPLETE'`.

**Root Cause**: The `CROSSFADE_COMPLETE` event topic is either missing or not correctly referenced by the `TimelineExecutorService` during its initialization.

**Updates Since Last Log**:
- Encountered and fixed a `BlockingIOError` by implementing queued logging in `main.py` using `logging.handlers.QueueHandler` and `logging.handlers.QueueListener`.
- Documented the asynchronous logging pattern in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md` (Section 11.1).
- Corrected an `AttributeError` in the `set_global_log_level` function related to handling the console logger in the new queued setup.

**Impact**: The `TimelineExecutorService` is not running, which will prevent execution of timeline plans including crossfades and other coordinated actions.

**Learning**: Need to ensure consistency of event topic definitions and references across all services.

**Next**: Investigate why `TimelineExecutorService` cannot access `EventTopics.CROSSFADE_COMPLETE` and correct the issue.

---

## [14:00] Refactor #45: Improved Event Payload Standardization

**Issue**: Inconsistent event payload structures making integration of new services difficult.

**Root Cause**: Lack of centralized payload definitions and validation.

**Changes**:
- Created centralized `event_schemas.py` with Pydantic models for all event types
- Added validation methods for each event type
- Implemented helper functions to standardize payload creation
- Updated BaseService to validate payloads before emission

**Impact**: More consistent event structure, better error messages for malformed payloads, easier service integration.

**Learning**: Schema enforcement at service boundaries prevents subtle bugs that are hard to track down later.

**Next**: Update existing services to use the new schema definitions.

---

## [14:14] Bug: Startup Failure - Missing Debug Service

**Issue**: System failed to start with an error: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'start'` for the 'debug' service.

**Root Cause**: The `DebugService` class was not imported and registered in the `service_class_map` within `cantina_os/cantina_os/main.py`.

**Changes**:
- Imported `DebugService` from `cantina_os.services.debug_service`.
- Added `"debug": DebugService` to the `service_class_map` in the `_create_service` method in `main.py`.

**Impact**: Resolved the critical startup error, allowing the system to initialize successfully.

**Learning**: Confirmed the importance of strictly adhering to `SERVICE_TEMPLATE_GUIDELINES.md` section 4 regarding service registration in `main.py` to prevent `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'start'` errors during startup.

**Next**: Verify successful system startup. Consider addressing other identified minor deviations in `CachedSpeechService` if they become apparent as issues.

---

## [14:15] Code Review: `CachedSpeechService` against Standards

**Issue**: Reviewed `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/cached_speech_service.py` against `SERVICE_TEMPLATE_GUIDELINES.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md` and found several deviations.

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent application of architecture standards, specifically regarding event emission, task management, and async method usage.

**Changes**: Identified the following areas requiring correction:
- Event emissions often use raw dictionaries instead of `_emit_dict()` with Pydantic models.
- The `unsubscribe` method is incorrectly awaited in `_generate_speech_audio`.
- Service status is emitted directly instead of using `_emit_status()`.
- Background task created in `_start` is missing an exception handling callback (`add_done_callback`).

**Impact**: These deviations could lead to runtime errors (e.g., downstream services failing due to unexpected payload formats) or resource leaks (e.g., unhandled task exceptions).

**Learning**: Reinforces the need for strict adherence to documented standards for event handling, task management, and async operations.

**Next**: Implement changes to align `CachedSpeechService` with architecture standards. This includes updating event emissions, fixing async calls, using the status helper, and adding task callbacks.

---

## [14:20] Fixes Applied to `CachedSpeechService`

**Issue**: Implement changes in `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/cached_speech_service.py` to address the architectural deviations identified in the previous review.

**Root Cause**: Previous implementation did not fully adhere to event handling, task management, and async method usage standards.

**Changes**:
- Replaced direct dictionary event emissions with `_emit_dict()` calls, utilizing available Pydantic models where possible (e.g., `SpeechCacheErrorPayload` for cache misses) and adding `TODO` comments for others.
- Removed the incorrect `await` from the `self.unsubscribe` method call.
- Switched from direct `SERVICE_STATUS` emission to using the `self._emit_status()` helper.
- Added an `add_done_callback(self._handle_task_exception)` to the `_cache_cleanup_loop` task to handle exceptions.

**Impact**: The `CachedSpeechService` now better conforms to the project's architecture standards, reducing the risk of inconsistent event payloads and unhandled task errors.

**Learning**: Continued reinforcement of the importance of using standardized helpers (`_emit_dict`, `_emit_status`) and proper async/task management patterns.

**Next**: Restart the server to run with the updated service code. Consider defining dedicated Pydantic models for all event payloads as noted in `TODO` comments.

---

## [14:25] Bug: `CachedSpeechService` Startup Error - Missing Task Exception Handler

**Issue**: System startup failed with an `AttributeError: 'CachedSpeechService' object has no attribute '_handle_task_exception'` when trying to start the `cached_speech_service`.

**Root Cause**: The `_handle_task_exception` method, which was added as a callback to the cache cleanup task, was not defined in the `CachedSpeechService` class.

**Changes**: Need to add the `_handle_task_exception` method to `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/cached_speech_service.py` as required by `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md` section 6.3 for proper task exception handling.

**Impact**: Prevents the `cached_speech_service` from starting, causing the overall system initialization to fail at that point.

**Learning**: Crucial to ensure all referenced methods, especially task callbacks specified by architectural standards, are correctly implemented in the service class.

**Next**: Add the `_handle_task_exception` method to `CachedSpeechService` and restart the server.

---

## [14:40] Bug: `CachedSpeechService` `RuntimeWarning` - Unawaited Coroutine

**Issue**: System startup showed a `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'BaseService._emit_status' was never awaited` in `cached_speech_service.py`.

**Root Cause**: The `self._emit_status()` method, which is an asynchronous coroutine, was called without the `await` keyword in the `_start` method of `CachedSpeechService`.

**Changes**: Need to add the `await` keyword before the `self._emit_status()` call on line 223 in `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/cached_speech_service.py` to correctly await the coroutine.

**Impact**: While currently only a warning, calling coroutines without awaiting them can lead to unexpected behavior and resource leaks.

**Learning**: Reinforces the critical need to `await` all asynchronous method calls as per `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md` section 3.1.

**Next**: Add `await` to the `_emit_status()` call and restart the server to confirm the warning is resolved.

---

## [14:45] Startup Issues and `CachedSpeechService` Fixes Resolved

**Issue**: Multiple startup errors and warnings were encountered, including a critical failure related to the 'debug' service and subsequent issues in the `cached_speech_service`.

**Root Cause**: Missing service registration in `main.py`, absence of a required task exception handler method, and unawaited asynchronous method calls.

**Changes**:
- Registered `DebugService` in `cantina_os/cantina_os/main.py`.
- Added the missing `_handle_task_exception` method to `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/cached_speech_service.py`.
- Added `await` before the `self._emit_status()` call in `CachedSpeechService._start`.
- Updated event emissions in `CachedSpeechService` to use `_emit_dict()` where possible.

**Impact**: The system now initializes successfully without critical errors or the specific warnings addressed. The `CachedSpeechService` is more compliant with architectural standards.

**Learning**: Highlights the importance of complete service registration, implementing all standard handler methods (like task exception handlers), and correctly using `await` with coroutines for stable system startup and operation.

**Next**: Continue with planned development. Consider defining dedicated Pydantic models for event payloads in `CachedSpeechService` marked with `TODO` comments for full adherence to standards.

## [17:15] Progress on DJ Mode (CachedSpeechService & BrainService)

**Issue**: Implement core DJ mode components related to speech caching and commentary generation as per `DJ_Mode_Plan.md`. Address encountered errors and ensure architectural compliance.

**Root Cause**: Standard development process of building out new features and refactoring existing code. Initial implementation in `BrainService` lacked the required `BaseService` structure. A bug in `CachedSpeechService` used `asyncio.Lock` incorrectly.

**Changes**:
- **CachedSpeechService**:
    - Defined and implemented Pydantic models (`SpeechCacheUpdatedPayload`, `SpeechCacheHitPayload`, `SpeechCacheClearedPayload`) for event emissions to standardize payloads.
    - Fixed bug where `asyncio.Lock` was used with a synchronous `with` statement in `_cleanup_expired_entries` by making the method async and using `async with`.
- **BrainService**:
    - Added the core `BaseService` structure, including `__init__`, `_start`, `_stop`, `_setup_subscriptions`, and `_handle_task_exception`.
    - Implemented configuration loading using Pydantic (`BrainServiceConfig`).
    - Added logic to load DJ R3X personas from files.
    - Integrated existing `_handle_dj_mode_changed`, `_smart_track_selection`, `_handle_dj_next_track`, `_handle_dj_command`, and `_handle_music_library_updated` methods into the `BrainService` class.
    - Implemented the `_commentary_caching_loop` background task to select the next track and request commentary generation from `GPTService` using the DJ R3X personas and track metadata.
    - Added placeholder handler methods (`_handle_gpt_commentary_response` and `_handle_track_ending_soon`) for future implementation of GPT response processing, caching requests, and timeline plan triggering.
    - Addressed and attempted to fix linter errors introduced during refactoring and new code addition.
- **Event Topics**:
    - Added new event topics (`DJ_COMMENTARY_REQUEST`, `GPT_COMMENTARY_RESPONSE`, `TRACK_ENDING_SOON`) to `cantina_os/cantina_os/core/event_topics.py` to support the DJ mode event flow.

**Impact**: Significant progress on the core infrastructure for DJ mode, including standardized event handling, background commentary generation logic, and correct service structure. Addressed critical bugs for system stability.

**Learning**: Reinforces the importance of following `SERVICE_TEMPLATE_GUIDELINES.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md` from the outset for new services. Complex Pydantic object manipulation within dictionary literals can cause subtle syntax issues that are hard to debug.

**Next**: Continue working on DJ mode implementation in `BrainService`. Specifically, integrate the `_handle_gpt_commentary_response` and `_handle_track_ending_soon` logic to trigger speech caching and timeline plan execution. Investigate the persistent linter error in `_handle_gpt_commentary_response`.

## [15:08] Progress on DJ Mode Implementation

**Issue**: Continue implementation of DJ Mode as per `DJ_Mode_Plan.md`.

**Root Cause**: Standard feature development.

**Changes**:
- Updated `DJ_Mode_Plan.md` checklist to reflect completed tasks in Phase 1 (CachedSpeechService audio threading) and Phase 2 (BrainService commentary logic, caching task, event handling, and persona creation).
- Created a new dedicated persona file (`cantina_os/dj_r3x-transition-persona.txt`) for generating transition commentary between tracks.
- Reviewed existing `BrainService` code to confirm implementation of commentary caching loop, passing track metadata to GPTService, handling `TRACK_ENDING_SOON` events, and activating plans for `DJ_NEXT` commands.

**Impact**: Significant progress made on core DJ intelligence and infrastructure for automated transitions. Dedicated persona created for improved commentary generation.

**Learning**: Regular review of plan documents and codebase helps accurately track progress and identify next steps. Persona design requires careful consideration of different commentary types.

**Next**: Define Pydantic models for DJ mode event payloads and ensure `TimelineExecutorService` compatibility with the BrainService plan structure.

## [15:36] Bug: Startup Errors - Missing Event Schema and Topic

**Issue**: System startup failed with `ImportError` for `SpeechCachePlaybackRequestPayload` and subsequently `AttributeError` for missing `CROSSFADE_COMPLETE` event topic.

**Root Cause**: The `SpeechCachePlaybackRequestPayload` Pydantic model was missing from `event_schemas.py`, and the `CROSSFADE_COMPLETE` member was missing from the `EventTopics` enum in `event_topics.py`.

**Changes**:
- Added `SpeechCachePlaybackRequestPayload` to `cantina_os/cantina_os/core/event_schemas.py`.
- Manually added `CROSSFADE_COMPLETE = "crossfade.complete"` to the `EventTopics` enum in `cantina_os/cantina_os/core/event_topics.py`.

**Impact**: Resolved critical startup errors, allowing the system to initialize successfully. Confirmed that event system and Pydantic model checklist items in `DJ_Mode_Plan.md` are correctly marked as completed.

**Learning**: Crucial to ensure all required event topics and corresponding Pydantic payload models are defined and correctly placed for inter-service communication, especially after refactoring or adding new features relying on the event bus.

**Next**: Continue working on the remaining items in the `DJ_Mode_Plan.md`.

## [15:38] Feature #XX: MemoryService State Persistence

**Issue**: MemoryService state, including DJ mode state, was not persistent across system restarts.

**Root Cause**: No mechanism implemented to save and load the internal state of the MemoryService.

**Changes**:
- Added `json` and `os` imports to `cantina_os/cantina_os/services/memory_service/memory_service.py`.
- Defined `STATE_FILE_PATH` constant for the persistence file (`cantina_os/cantina_os/services/memory_service/data/memory_state.json`).
- Implemented `_load_state` method to read state from the JSON file on startup, with error handling for file not found or decoding errors.
- Implemented `_save_state` method to write the current state to the JSON file, ensuring the data directory exists.
- Modified `__init__` to call `_load_state` and initialize default values for keys if not loaded.
- Modified `_stop` to call `_save_state` before clearing tasks.
- Modified `set` method to call `_save_state` after updating a key value.

**Impact**: MemoryService state, including DJ mode activity, track history, and preferences, will now persist across system restarts, improving the continuity of the DJ mode experience.

**Learning**: Implementing persistence is crucial for maintaining application state, especially for long-running features like DJ mode. Ensuring error handling during file operations is important for robustness.

**Next**: Continue with DJ mode implementation by refining track history logic, and implementing user preference and lookahead cache state management in MemoryService, followed by integrating with the TimelineExecutorService.

## [16:10] Bug: Service Startup Errors - Event Topic Mismatches

**Issue**: Multiple services failing to start due to event topic mismatches and legacy subscriptions.

**Root Cause**: 
- `BrainService` using outdated `MUSIC_PLAYBACK_STARTED` instead of `TRACK_PLAYING`
- `TimelineExecutorService` attempting to subscribe to legacy `SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_ENDED` topic
- `MemoryService` failing on `DJ_MODE_CHANGED` subscription (fixed in previous commit)

**Changes**:
- **BrainService**: Updated subscription from `MUSIC_PLAYBACK_STARTED` to `TRACK_PLAYING` for music state tracking
- **TimelineExecutorService**: 
  - Commented out legacy `SPEECH_SYNTHESIS_ENDED` subscription
  - Kept necessary `SPEECH_GENERATION_COMPLETE` subscription for modern speech handling
  - Fixed accidentally removed exception handler in `_handle_crossfade_complete`

**Impact**: Services now start successfully without event topic errors, allowing proper initialization of the DJ mode system components.

**Learning**: Event topic consistency is crucial across services. When updating event systems, need to ensure all services are updated to use the current topic names and that legacy subscriptions are properly removed or updated.

**Next**: Continue with DJ mode implementation now that core services are starting correctly.

## [TIME] Bug: BrainService Startup Error - MEMORY_VALUE

**Issue**: The `BrainService` failed to start with a `MEMORY_VALUE` error, as seen in the latest terminal logs (timestamp 16:11:39).

**Root Cause**: The `BrainService` is likely attempting to access state from the `MemoryService` during startup using event topics (`DJ_TRACK_QUEUED`, `MEMORY_GET`, `MEMORY_SET`) that the `MemoryService` reported as "not found" just prior to the `BrainService` failure in the logs. This suggests an issue with the definition or accessibility of these event topics.

**Updates Since Last Log**: This issue was observed in the terminal output after the fixes for general service startup event topic mismatches were logged at [16:10].

**Impact**: The `BrainService` does not start, preventing core DJ mode intelligence and state management from initializing.

**Learning**: Need to verify the correct definition and availability of all event topics used by services, especially during startup sequences.

**Next**: Investigate the `cantina_os/cantina_os/core/event_topics.py` file to ensure `DJ_TRACK_QUEUED`, `MEMORY_GET`, and `MEMORY_SET` are correctly defined and that the `MemoryService` and `BrainService` are referencing them properly.

## [TIME] Update: Event Topic Fix Confirmed, BrainService Still Failing

**Issue**: The `BrainService` continues to fail startup with a `MEMORY_VALUE` error after adding the missing event topics (`DJ_TRACK_QUEUED`, `MEMORY_GET`, `MEMORY_SET`). The `MemoryService` no longer reports missing these topics, as seen in the latest logs (timestamp 16:13:00).

**Root Cause**: The event topics are now defined, but the `BrainService` is still encountering an issue when attempting to use these topics to interact with the `MemoryService`. This could be due to incorrect usage of the topics, a problem within `MemoryService`'s handling of these events, or a data mismatch in the event payloads.

**Updates Since Last Log**: Confirmed in the latest logs that adding the missing event topics resolved the `MemoryService`'s errors regarding those topics.

**Impact**: The `BrainService` remains non-operational, preventing core DJ mode functionality.

**Learning**: Defining event topics is only the first step; the implementation of sending and receiving services must correctly handle the events and their payloads.

**Next**: Examine the `BrainService` code (`cantina_os/cantina_os/services/brain_service/brain_service.py`) to understand its interactions with the `MemoryService` during startup, specifically looking for uses of `MEMORY_GET`, `MEMORY_SET`, and `DJ_TRACK_QUEUED`, and verify correct payload structures and handling.

## [16:16] Bug: BrainService Startup Issue - MEMORY_VALUE Error

**Issue**: `BrainService` consistently fails to start with `MEMORY_VALUE` error, even after adding missing event topics and improving error handling.

**Root Cause**: Initial investigation suggested missing event topics (`DJ_TRACK_QUEUED`, `MEMORY_GET`, `MEMORY_SET`), but the issue persists after adding these. Current hypothesis is that the service is failing during memory value initialization, possibly due to timing or state management issues.

**Changes**:
- Added missing event topics to `EventTopics` enum
- Modified `_handle_memory_value` method to handle missing/null values gracefully
- Updated `_start` method with better state initialization and error handling
- Added more detailed debug logging
- Made memory value fetching optional during startup
- Added default state values for DJ mode and track history

**Impact**: `BrainService` still fails to start, preventing DJ mode functionality. Other services continue to operate normally.

**Learning**: 
- Event topic definitions alone weren't sufficient to fix the startup issue
- Need to investigate potential race conditions or timing issues during service initialization
- Memory service interaction during startup needs closer examination

**Next**: 
1. Enable debug logging to trace exact failure point
2. Investigate potential race conditions in memory service interaction
3. Consider implementing retry mechanism for memory value fetching
4. Review memory service startup sequence and state initialization
