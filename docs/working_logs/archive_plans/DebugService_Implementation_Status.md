## üéØ Implementation Status

The core implementation of the DebugService is complete and operational. All planned features have been implemented and integrated into the system. The service is now:

1. Handling logging asynchronously
2. Providing component-level log control
3. Supporting command tracing
4. Collecting performance metrics
5. Tracking state transitions
6. Offering CLI commands for debugging

The next phase should focus on:
1. Comprehensive testing
2. Documentation updates
3. Setting up monitoring and alerts
4. Adding log rotation and management features
