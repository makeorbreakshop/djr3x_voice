# DJ R3X Holocron ‚Äî RAG Knowledge System

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan for adding a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge system to the DJ R3X voice assistant. The system will allow DJ R3X to access and utilize Star Wars canonical knowledge from Wookieepedia, enhancing the character's ability to engage in informed conversations about the Star Wars universe.

## Goals & Requirements

### Primary Goals

## Knowledge Base Expansion Plan

To scale the system from our initial proof-of-concept to a comprehensive Star Wars knowledge base, we've developed a phased approach focused on both technical scalability and content relevance.

### 1. URL Collection System (üîÑ IN PROGRESS)
- **Purpose**: Systematically gather and prioritize Wookieepedia articles
- **Tasks**:
  - [‚úÖ] Create sitemap crawler for discovering all available articles
  - [‚úÖ] Implement category-based URL collection focusing on relevant topics
  - [‚úÖ] Store URLs with metadata (priority, category, etc.) in structured format
  - [‚úÖ] Add filtering to exclude non-canonical content
  - [‚úÖ] Create reporting to understand content coverage
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Created `sitemap_crawler.py` for comprehensive article discovery
    - Implemented `category_crawler.py` for focused content collection
    - Developed `url_store.py` for Supabase storage with metadata
    - Added `content_filter.py` for canonical vs non-canonical filtering
    - Built `reporting.py` for coverage analysis
    - Resolved dependency conflicts in requirements.txt for stable deployment

### 2. Phased Content Approach (üìã PLANNED)
- **Purpose**: Prioritize the most relevant content for DJ R3X
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] **Phase 1 - Core Identity**: Collect ~50-100 articles about:
    - [ ] R3X/RX-24 specific information
    - [ ] Oga's Cantina and direct workplace
    - [ ] DJ/entertainment roles in Star Wars
  - [ ] **Phase 2 - Immediate Context**: Expand to ~200-300 articles about:
    - [ ] Batuu and Black Spire Outpost
    - [ ] Galaxy's Edge locations and characters
    - [ ] Star Tours history and locations
  - [ ] **Phase 3 - Professional Context**: Add ~500-1000 articles covering:
    - [ ] Droids (especially RX-series and entertainment models)
    - [ ] Music and musicians in Star Wars
    - [ ] Spaceports and cantinas
    - [ ] Piloting and navigation
  - [ ] **Phase 4 - General Knowledge**: Expand to broader Star Wars knowledge

   - Will be refactored to use Robot Operating System (ROS) instead
   - Core scraping and vectorization functionality will be preserved
   - Voice manager integration will need to be reimplemented for ROS

2. **Performance Optimization** (PENDING):
   - Measure and optimize response latency
   - Implement caching for common queries

3. **Visual Integration** (PENDING):
   - Add LED patterns or animations for "consulting the holocron"
   - Provide visual feedback during knowledge retrieval

## Transition Plan

### Phase 1: Standalone RAG Pipeline (CURRENT)
- Continue using the implemented scraping and vectorization components
- Maintain and expand the knowledge base in Supabase
- Run these components independently of the voice system

### Phase 2: ROS Migration (PLANNED)
- Refactor the Holocron Manager to use ROS instead of the current event bus
- Create ROS nodes for knowledge retrieval and processing
- Implement proper message passing between components
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data format

### Phase 3: Full Integration (FUTURE)
- Integrate the ROS-based Holocron system with the main DJ R3X platform
- Implement visual effects for knowledge retrieval
- Add comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Optimize for performance in real-time interactions

## Technical Insights

Based on our initial implementation and testing, we've identified several key technical considerations for scaling:

1. **Vector Database Performance**:
   - HNSW indexing provides excellent O(log N) search performance, suitable for large collections
   - Connection pooling is essential for handling parallel operations
   - Index creation becomes time-intensive at scale; incremental approaches are recommended

2. **Resource Requirements**:
   - Storage needs: ~60MB per 1000 articles (vector data only)
   - For full Wookieepedia coverage (~100K articles), we'll need ~6GB for vectors
   - Current Supabase configuration adequate for thousands of articles; may need adjustment for tens of thousands

3. **Batch Processing Considerations**:
   - Rate limiting is essential for respectful crawling
   - Worker-based parallel processing with proper coordination
   - Robust error handling and resumability crucial for large operations

## Test Queries

The following test queries can be used to validate embedding quality and retrieval performance:

1. "Tell me about the Millennium Falcon"
2. "Who is Darth Vader?"
3. "What is a lightsaber made of?"
4. "Explain the Force"
5. "What happened during the Clone Wars?"
6. "What planet is Tatooine?"
7. "Who built C-3PO?"
8. "What is the Jedi Code?"
9. "Who was Luke Skywalker's father?"
10. "What happened to the Republic?"

## Appendix: Sample RAG Flow
1. User asks: "Tell me about the history of the Millennium Falcon"
2. System detects knowledge-seeking query
3. RAG system retrieves relevant context from vector DB
4. Context is injected into GPT-4o prompt
5. DJ R3X responds: "Let me consult the holocron on that one... *brief pause* Ah, the Millennium Falcon! That legendary YT-1300 light freighter has quite the story. Originally owned by Lando Calrissian who lost it to Han Solo in a game of sabacc, it became famous for making the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs! It's been through some serious adventures, from outrunning Imperial cruisers to helping destroy not one, but two Death Stars. The ship might look like a piece of junk, but she's got it where it counts!"
