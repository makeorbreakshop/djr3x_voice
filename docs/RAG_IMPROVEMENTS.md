# DJ-R3X RAG System Improvements

This document outlines the key improvements made to the DJ-R3X Holocron Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## Overview of Improvements

The RAG system has been enhanced with the following features, focused on the "80/20" principle of maximum impact with minimal implementation effort:

1. **Enhanced Reranking Algorithm**
2. **Smart Metadata Filtering**
3. **Query Preprocessing and Expansion**

## Enhanced Reranking Algorithm

### What It Does
- Improves result ordering based on multiple relevance signals
- Considers both semantic similarity and lexical matching
- Boosts results based on:
  - Term-matching in content
  - Title matching
  - Canon status
  - Content size

### How It Helps
- More relevant results appear at the top
- Results with exact term matches are properly prioritized
- Canonical content is preferred over non-canonical content
- More comprehensive answers with better context

### Implementation Details
```python
# Calculate final rerank score
final_score = score + term_match_score + title_match + canon_boost + size_boost
```

## Smart Metadata Filtering

### What It Does
- Automatically detects filtering needs from query intent
- Applies appropriate filters to:
  - Eras (prequel, original, sequel)
  - Content types (character, location, vehicle)
  - Canon vs. Legends

### How It Helps
- Narrows search scope for more targeted results
- Filters out irrelevant content
- Respects user's implicit filtering needs

### Implementation Details
```python
def _detect_metadata_filters(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    filters = {}
    
    # Check for era indicators
    if any(term in query.lower() for term in ["prequel", "clone wars", "republic"]):
        filters["era"] = "prequel"
    elif any(term in query.lower() for term in ["original trilogy", "rebellion", "empire"]):
        filters["era"] = "original"
    # ...more filters
```

## Query Preprocessing and Expansion

### What It Does
- Expands query with Star Wars-specific terminology
- Handles follow-up questions by incorporating context
- Maps colloquial terms to canonical concepts

### How It Helps
- Improves results for queries with non-standard terminology
- Handles conversational follow-up questions
- Bridges the gap between user language and knowledge base terminology

### Implementation Details
```python
def _expand_query(self, query: str) -> str:
    expanded_query = query
    
    # Look for known terms that have aliases
    for term, aliases in self.starwars_aliases.items():
        if term.lower() in query.lower():
            continue
                
        # Check if any aliases are in the query
        for alias in aliases:
            if alias.lower() in query.lower():
                expanded_query += f" {term}"
                break
    
    # Handle follow-up questions
    # ...
```

## How to Test the Improvements

Run the example script to see the improvements in action:

```bash
python scripts/improved_rag_example.py
```

This will run through a series of demonstration queries that showcase each improvement.

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:

1. Use a proper cross-encoder model for reranking
2. Consider adding hybrid search with sparse vectors (requires new index configuration)
3. Add multi-vector retrieval for complex queries
4. Implement a more sophisticated query expansion mechanism

## Technical Requirements

The improved system requires:

- NLTK for natural language processing
- Python 3.8+ for Counter and other features
- Pinecone for vector search
- OpenAI for embeddings and completions
