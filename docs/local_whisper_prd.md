üéØ Purpose
To implement local Whisper speech recognition in DJ R3X to significantly reduce latency in speech-to-text processing while maintaining high accuracy. This change will eliminate API call overhead and network dependencies while potentially reducing operational costs.

üß† Overview
The local Whisper implementation will:
- Replace the current OpenAI Whisper API calls with local model inference
- Maintain or improve transcription accuracy
- Significantly reduce latency (50-80% improvement expected)
- Support offline operation
- Integrate seamlessly with existing DJ R3X architecture

‚ö° Performance Comparison
Current API Implementation:
- Average latency: 1-2 seconds
- Network dependent
- Cost: Pay per API call

Local Implementation Target:
- Average latency: 200-500ms
- Network independent
- Cost: One-time model download
- GPU acceleration when available

üîß Technical Requirements

1. Model Selection
   - Default: Whisper Base
   - Optional: Medium/Large models for higher accuracy
   - Model size vs. performance tradeoffs:
     * Base: 1GB, good for most use cases
     * Medium: 2.6GB, better accuracy
     * Large: 6GB, highest accuracy

2. Hardware Requirements
   - Minimum:
     * CPU: 4 cores
     * RAM: 8GB
     * Storage: 2GB for base model
   - Recommended:
     * CPU: 8+ cores
     * RAM: 16GB
     * GPU: CUDA-compatible (optional)
     * Storage: 8GB for medium model

3. Dependencies

   torch>=2.2.0
   numpy>=1.24.0
   ```

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

1. Model Management
   ```python
   class WhisperManager:
       def __init__(self, model_size: str = "base"):
           self.model = None
           self.model_size = model_size
           
       async def load_model(self):
           """Loads model in background thread"""
           
       async def transcribe(self, audio_data: np.ndarray) -> str:
           """Performs transcription"""
   ```

2. Integration Points
   - Replace current Whisper API calls in rex_talk.py
   - Maintain async interface
   - Add model initialization during startup

3. Configuration Options
   ```python
   WHISPER_CONFIG = {
       "model_size": "base",  # base, medium, large
       "device": "auto",      # cpu, cuda
       "language": "en",      # default language
       "task": "transcribe"   # transcribe or translate
   }
   ```
