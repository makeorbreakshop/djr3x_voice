# E5 Migration Issues

## 2025-05-15: Migration Script Hanging on Vector Queries

### Issue
The `migrate_to_e5_embeddings.py` script is hanging indefinitely during vector queries to the source index (holocron-knowledge).

### Details
- Script successfully loads checkpoint (9,927 processed IDs)
- Source index contains 679,826 total vectors
- Script hangs at "Fetching batch of vectors" stage
- No error messages or timeouts, just complete silence after query attempt
- Issue persists across different batch sizes (10, 100, 1000)

### Current State
- Migration is stuck at 0% progress
- No vectors successfully migrated in latest attempts
- Process appears alive but non-responsive

### Next Steps
1. Verify Pinecone connection stability
2. Test simple queries to isolate if issue is with:
   - Query size
   - Random vector generation
   - Connection timeout
   - Rate limiting
3. Consider implementing query timeout and retry mechanism
4. May need to explore alternative querying strategy (e.g., ID-based fetching)
