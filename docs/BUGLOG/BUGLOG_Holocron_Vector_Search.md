# Holocron Vector Search Bug Log

## Issue Summary
Vector search functionality is failing with error: `object list can't be used in 'await' expression` across all search methods (RPC, SQL, and basic). This prevents the Holocron RAG system from retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base.

## Environment
- Supabase Client Version: 2.3.5
- OpenAI SDK Version: Latest (v1.x)
- Python: 3.10+
- Script: `scripts/simple_holocron_chat.py`

## Observed Behavior
When running the script, the following errors occur in sequence:
1. `WARNING - Search method _search_rpc failed: object list can't be used in 'await' expression`
2. `WARNING - Search method _search_sql failed: object list can't be used in 'await' expression`
3. `WARNING - Search method _search_basic failed: object list can't be used in 'await' expression`

Despite these errors, the chat continues to function but likely without properly retrieved context from the vector database.

## Expected Behavior
The vector search should successfully retrieve relevant documents from the Supabase database using one of the three methods (preferably the RPC method), and these should be incorporated into the prompt sent to OpenAI.

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the error message and dev log entries, the core issue involves asynchronous programming patterns:

1. **Coroutine Handling Issue**: The vector search methods are returning coroutines (from async functions) but the code is attempting to await a list of objects rather than properly awaiting each coroutine or using `asyncio.gather()`.

2. **Async/Sync Mismatch**: There's inconsistency in how async functions are being called and awaited throughout the codebase.

3. **List Iteration Pattern**: The error suggests the code is trying to iterate over or access elements of what it expects to be a list, but is actually a coroutine object.

## Technical Context from Dev Log
From the dev log entry on 2025-05-08, it was identified that:
- "Vector search method in `VectorSearch` class returning coroutine instead of executing it"
- "Mismatch between sync and async methods in search implementation"
- "Need to properly await vector search results in chat interface"

## Hypothesis for Resolution
The issue can likely be resolved through the following approaches:

1. **Proper Coroutine Handling**:
   - Ensure all async methods are properly awaited
   - Use `asyncio.gather()` when awaiting multiple coroutines
   - Fix the pattern of returning coroutines versus awaiting them internally

2. **Consistent Async Patterns**:
   - Standardize how async methods are implemented across the codebase
   - Ensure all callers of async methods properly await the results
   - Create clear boundaries between sync and async code

3. **List Processing**:
   - If processing lists of results from async operations, ensure the async operation completes first
   - Check if the result processing code expects a different data structure than what's being returned

4. **Specific Focus Areas**:
   - `VectorSearch` class in `holocron/database/vector_search.py`
   - Chat interface in `scripts/simple_holocron_chat.py`
   - Database layer in `holocron/database/holocron_db.py`

## Testing Strategy
Once fixed, validate with:
1. Direct execution of `scripts/simple_holocron_chat.py`
2. Run database integration tests in `tests/test_holocron_db.py`
3. Execute vector search tests in `tests/test_vector_search.py`
4. Verify results include semantically relevant context

2. Different import path required for async client access
3. Potential version mismatch between documentation and implementation

#### Next Steps:
1. **Investigation**:
   - Research Supabase's async client implementation in version 2.3.5
   - Review Supabase's Python client documentation for correct async patterns
   - Check for alternative import paths or client creation methods

2. **Potential Solutions**:
   - Investigate using `create_client(...)` with async options instead of direct AsyncClient usage
   - Consider upgrading/downgrading Supabase client version if needed
   - Look into alternative async implementation patterns supported by current version

3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Update client_factory.py to use correct async client creation method
   - Modify type hints and imports across the codebase
   - Update documentation to reflect correct async usage patterns
   - Add version compatibility notes to documentation

4. **Validation**:
   - Test client creation with various Supabase versions
   - Verify async operations work end-to-end

# BUGLOG: Holocron Vector Search Timeout Issue

## Issue Overview

The Holocron Knowledge System is experiencing critical timeout errors during vector searches against our Supabase pgvector database. This prevents the system from retrieving relevant Star Wars information when users ask questions.

**Error Message:**
```
WARNING:holocron.database.vector_search:RPC search failed: {'code': '57014', 'details': None, 'hint': None, 'message': 'canceling statement due to statement timeout'}
```

**Context:**
- Database: Supabase with pgvector extension (v0.8.0)
- Vector dimensions: 1536 (text-embedding-ada-002)
- Records: 8,631 knowledge entries (200MB)
- Current implementation: Single RPC function `match_documents` with LLM fallback
- Current HNSW index parameters: m=32, ef_construction=100
- Current similarity threshold: 0.2

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Factors

1. **Query Performance**
   - The vector similarity search is too computationally expensive for our current setup
   - Low similarity threshold (0.2) likely returning too many results
   - Possible full table scan instead of efficient index usage
   - 1536-dimensional vectors require significant computation

2. **Resource Limitations**
   - Supabase has strict query timeout limits (default: 3 seconds)
   - Free/lower tier plans have more aggressive timeouts
   - Vector operations are CPU-intensive, quickly hitting limits

3. **Index Configuration**
   - HNSW index may not be optimized for our specific query patterns
   - Current parameters may not provide the right balance of accuracy vs. speed
   - Index may not be fully utilized by our query

4. **Implementation Issues**
   - RPC function `match_documents` may not be optimized for performance
   - Missing critical parameters like LIMIT to constrain execution time
   - Possible issues with vector data type handling

## Systematic Testing Plan

### Test 1: Baseline Query Performance

**Objective:** Establish baseline performance and identify exact timeout threshold

**Steps:**
1. Create simplified test query with minimal vector dimensions (e.g., 32d)
2. Gradually increase vector dimensions (32→128→512→1536)
3. Measure execution time at each step
4. Identify point where timeout occurs

**Expected Outcome:** Clear understanding of when queries start timing out

### Test 2: Similarity Threshold Impact

**Objective:** Determine optimal similarity threshold for performance vs. relevance

**Steps:**
1. Start with high threshold (e.g., 0.9) and gradually decrease
2. Measure:
   - Query execution time
   - Number of results returned
   - Relevance of results (manual review)
3. Find threshold where execution time approaches timeout

**Expected Outcome:** Optimal similarity threshold balancing performance and relevance

### Test 3: HNSW Index Parameter Optimization

**Objective:** Optimize HNSW index parameters for our specific workload

**Steps:**
1. Test different combinations of parameters:
   - `m`: 16, 32, 64 (connections per layer)
   - `ef_construction`: 64, 100, 200 (size of dynamic candidate list)
   - `ef`: 40, 80, 160 (search depth)
2. Measure query performance for each combination
3. Evaluate recall accuracy vs. performance

**Expected Outcome:** Optimal HNSW parameters for our specific use case

### Test 4: Query Optimization Techniques

**Objective:** Test various query optimization techniques

**Steps:**
1. Test with explicit LIMIT constraints (5, 10, 20 results)
2. Implement prefiltering with metadata (category, priority)
3. Try batched vector search (break into smaller searches)
4. Test approximate KNN vs. exact KNN search

**Expected Outcome:** Combination of techniques that prevent timeout

### Test 5: Resource Allocation Impact

**Objective:** Determine if resource allocation changes resolve the issue

**Steps:**
1. Temporarily upgrade Supabase plan (if possible)
2. Test same queries under different resource allocations
3. Measure performance improvements
4. Evaluate cost-benefit ratio

**Expected Outcome:** Understanding of resource limitations impact

## Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Query Optimization

```sql
-- Original approach (simplified)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_documents(
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  similarity_threshold float,
  match_count int
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id bigint,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  similarity float
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    hk.id,
    hk.content,
    hk.metadata,
    1 - (hk.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  FROM
    holocron_knowledge as hk
  WHERE
    1 - (hk.embedding <=> query_embedding) > similarity_threshold
  ORDER BY
    similarity DESC
  LIMIT match_count;
END;
$$;

-- Optimized approach
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_documents(
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  similarity_threshold float,
  match_count int DEFAULT 5,
  max_execution_time_ms int DEFAULT 2000
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id bigint,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  similarity float
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Set statement timeout to prevent long-running queries
  EXECUTE format('SET LOCAL statement_timeout = %L', max_execution_time_ms);
  
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    hk.id,
    hk.content,
    hk.metadata,
    1 - (hk.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  FROM
    holocron_knowledge as hk
  WHERE
    1 - (hk.embedding <=> query_embedding) > similarity_threshold
  ORDER BY
    hk.embedding <=> query_embedding  -- More efficient ordering
  LIMIT match_count;
END;
$$;
```

### Strategy 2: Index Optimization

```sql
-- Drop existing index if any
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS holocron_knowledge_embedding_idx;

-- Create optimized HNSW index
CREATE INDEX holocron_knowledge_embedding_idx
ON holocron_knowledge
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

### Strategy 3: Implementation Improvements

1. **Add graceful degradation:**
   - Start with strict parameters
   - If timeout occurs, retry with more permissive parameters
   - Gradually fall back to simpler/faster queries

2. **Client-side optimization:**
   - Implement caching for frequent queries
   - Use batched vector search for large result sets
   - Add proper timeout handling and retry logic

3. **Database maintenance:**
   - Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE operations
   - Index maintenance and rebuilding
   - Monitoring query performance over time

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Increase similarity threshold to 0.5 (immediately reduces result set)
2. Add explicit LIMIT to match_documents function (cap at 5-10 results)
3. Implement statement_timeout parameter in function (2000ms)
4. Run diagnostic queries to evaluate index usage

### Phase 2: Systematic Testing

1. Execute test plan (Tests 1-5)
2. Document results and optimal parameters
3. Develop comprehensive fix based on findings

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Optimize RPC function with findings from testing
2. Rebuild HNSW index with optimal parameters
3. Update client code to handle timeouts gracefully
