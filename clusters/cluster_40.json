When the player enters the room with the bar, the bartender will grumpily tell Kyle to get out of his bar, because he always causes trouble.\n\nSome events and descriptions in the cantina differ between the video game, the Dark Forces: Rebel Agent novelization and the audio dramatization; in the adaptations the bar is described much larger than what appears in the game. 8t88 finds Boba Fett in the booth in the novel, while in the dramatization Fett finds the droid first and announces his presence, saying that he prefers to arrange their business while standing. The subsequent skirmish with the thugs also differs between the game, the novel and the drama.\n\n",
