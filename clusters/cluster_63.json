Regardless, R-3X played the song in the town of Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu, both at Oga's Cantina and in a broadcast on the local radio station, BSO 401.72. R-3X considered both \"Droid World\" and its album to be hits.\n\nSentient 7 and the Clankers, including Pall Gopal, played onstage at a cantina in Actlyon City on Actlyon. While the band was present, the cantina was raided by bounty hunters in search of a waitress who owed them a debt. When the raiders exited the cantina, the members of Sentient 7 and the Clankers returned to their instruments and continued to play. Gopal instead approached a patron, the smuggler Izal Garsea, who the Rodian hired to deliver a package to Batuu. On Batuu, Garsea and the farmer Julen Rakab heard a portion of \"Droid World\" on the radio while delivering the package, but the signal became scrambled as they departed Black Spire Outpost.\n\n",
