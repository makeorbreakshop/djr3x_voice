Sentients drank it, and also used it in bantha butter, blue bantha buttermilk biscuits, blue-milk cheese, blue milk custard, ice cream, and yogurt. It was notably available on Outer Rim planets such as Batuu, Lah'mu, Lothal, and Tatooine. Cid's Parlor on Ord Mantell served a similar beverage that was alcoholic called Dark Blue Milk.\n\nDuring a lightsaber training session, the young Ezra Bridger had to protect himself as the astromech droid Chopper kept lobbing cartons of blue milk at him. Luke Skywalker drank blue milk while he discussed the new droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, with his aunt and uncle.\n\nTwo establishments in Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, served blue milk or blue milk-based concoctions; Milk Stand sold blue milk and an alcoholic Blue Milk Cooler, while Oga's Cantina served the non-alcoholic Blue Bantha.\n\n",

        "content": "# Blurrgfire - History[]\n\nAccording to chef Strono Tuggs, Blurrgfire was invented by a bartender at Oga's Cantina, an establishment that was owned by Oga Garra and located in Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet Batuu. In Tuggs' account, the bartender came up with a recipe that combined various juices and spices to mimic the flavor of citrom. Tuggs claimed that he could not tell the difference between citrom and Blurrgfire because the imitation was so perfect, and he included the anecdote and a recipe for the drink in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. Although Tuggs did not specify the bartender's name, author and explorer Eloc Throno wrote in his Traveler's Guide to Batuu that Garra put \"her own twist\" on the drink.\n\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, Blurrgfire was among the drink selections that the bartender Janott offered to Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala when she visited Oga's Cantina for a personal mission. It remained available at the cantina in 34 ABY, and on one occasion Resistance spy Vi Moradi drank it to stay sober and hangover-free while her ex-First Order companion Archex got intoxicated from a potent Jedi Mind Trick.\n\nAlso during 34 ABY, Blurrgfire was served at Aunt Z's Tavern on the Colossus, a mobile aircraft refueling station on the ocean planet Castilon, around the time of the First Order-Resistance War. While at the tavern, the Chadra-Fan Orka was drinking the beverage. After realizing that his pit droid G-LN was bored, Orka decided to let the repair droid try some of his Blurrgfire. Upon sipping the drink, G-LN began to cough and then became erratic, running around the tavern and disturbing other patrons. Shortly thereafter, the Klatooinian Bolza Grool hit G-LN on the head, incapacitating the droid and stopping the adverse effects of the Blurrgfire. Upon seeing G-LN unconscious, Orka made a joke to his partner Flix and ordered another round of Blurrgfire.\n\n",

Indeed, later that day, she drank a cup of it.\n\nBy the time of the Clone Wars, the Commerce Guild had taken control of Mooga and declared that Moogan Tea was their trademarked beverage with a proprietary recipe. The Commerce Guild created the Ardees Beverage Company to manufacture the bottled beverage with the brand name Ardees Beverage. The guild utilized corporate surveillance droids to identify establishments that attempted to sell their own homebrewed Moogan Tea. Despite the threat of being issued cease and desist transmissions, many businesses defiantly but discreetly continued to serve their brews.\n\nWhile the human Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala was on the Outer Rim planet Batuu for a personal mission later during the Clone Wars, she visited a cantina in Black Spire Outpost. She was offered alcoholic and non-alcoholic Moogan Tea by the bartender, Janott. In 3 ABY, the casino cruiser Morenia sold Moogan Tea for eleven credits.\n\nBy 34 ABY, that location had been named Oga's Cantina after its owner, Oga Garra, and it continued to serve the beverage during breakfast hours. In his Traveler's Guide to Batuu, author Eloc Throno described the Moogan Tea served at Oga's Cantina as \"well-garnished.\"\n\nThe Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs claimed that any respectable barkeep would know how to make real Moogan Tea from the original recipe, and he believed it was likely worth risking legal ramifications to have a taste. In 34 ABY, he took a risk himself with his cookbook The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook; it included his recipes for Moogan Tea made with his personal blend of Moogan Spice Syrup and a Christophsian sugar topping.\n\n",

There existed many types of tea. One was made from the florets of the Cassius tree. Another, known as Tarine tea, was served on planets as diverse as Lothal and Christophsis. Gatalenta was a planet famous for its tea. One tea was the Deychin tea. While some varieties of tea were consumed hot, others were served cold, such as Moogan Tea or its corporate-branded version, Ardees Beverage, which came in bottles or as a fizzy canned tea. Teahouses were establishments dedicated to the serving of tea. Sky Graf had fifty-seven percent oxidized green Orsh Mountain tea onboard the Brightbird which he served to Rooper Nitani on Batuu.\n\nAt some point during the Clone Wars, smugglers led by a Moogan named Tee Va came to Sundari, the capital city of Mandalore, where they distributed Ardees beverage tea diluted with slabin, a hazardous chemical. As a result, Tee Va's profits were doubled, but many Sundari schoolchildren became ill. However, due to to an investigation run by the Duchess of Mandalore, Satine Kryze, and the Galactic Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Tee Va and his smugglers were arrested.\n\n",

Some merchants on the desert planet Tatooine sold small tea bags at their market stalls. The drink shared its name with Moogan iced tea, a beverage served at the Day Star Hotel.\n\n",

Its flavor imitated juice from a citrom, a fruit that did not stay fresh for long, but was both sweet and sour with a burst of heat. Blurrgfire was suitable for consumption by Artiodacs, humans, and Chadra-Fans. When consumed by pit droids, Blurrgfire would cause erratic behavior.\n\n",

In Tuggs' account, the bartender came up with a recipe that combined various juices and spices to mimic the flavor of citrom. Tuggs claimed that he could not tell the difference between citrom and Blurrgfire because the imitation was so perfect, and he included the anecdote and a recipe for the drink in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. Although Tuggs did not specify the bartender's name, author and explorer Eloc Throno wrote in his Traveler's Guide to Batuu that Garra put \"her own twist\" on the drink.\n\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, Blurrgfire was among the drink selections that the bartender Janott offered to Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala when she visited Oga's Cantina for a personal mission. It remained available at the cantina in 34 ABY, and on one occasion Resistance spy Vi Moradi drank it to stay sober and hangover-free while her ex-First Order companion Archex got intoxicated from a potent Jedi Mind Trick.\n\nAlso during 34 ABY, Blurrgfire was served at Aunt Z's Tavern on the Colossus, a mobile aircraft refueling station on the ocean planet Castilon, around the time of the First Order-Resistance War. While at the tavern, the Chadra-Fan Orka was drinking the beverage. After realizing that his pit droid G-LN was bored, Orka decided to let the repair droid try some of his Blurrgfire. Upon sipping the drink, G-LN began to cough and then became erratic, running around the tavern and disturbing other patrons. Shortly thereafter, the Klatooinian Bolza Grool hit G-LN on the head, incapacitating the droid and stopping the adverse effects of the Blurrgfire. Upon seeing G-LN unconscious, Orka made a joke to his partner Flix and ordered another round of Blurrgfire.\n\n",

        "content": "# Moogan Tea - History[]\n\nAround 233 BBY, while on the snowy planet Andraven, the pilot Nash Durango eagerly anticipated drinking the tea, which she had been told would be available. Indeed, later that day, she drank a cup of it.\n\nBy the time of the Clone Wars, the Commerce Guild had taken control of Mooga and declared that Moogan Tea was their trademarked beverage with a proprietary recipe. The Commerce Guild created the Ardees Beverage Company to manufacture the bottled beverage with the brand name Ardees Beverage. The guild utilized corporate surveillance droids to identify establishments that attempted to sell their own homebrewed Moogan Tea. Despite the threat of being issued cease and desist transmissions, many businesses defiantly but discreetly continued to serve their brews.\n\nWhile the human Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala was on the Outer Rim planet Batuu for a personal mission later during the Clone Wars, she visited a cantina in Black Spire Outpost. She was offered alcoholic and non-alcoholic Moogan Tea by the bartender, Janott. In 3 ABY, the casino cruiser Morenia sold Moogan Tea for eleven credits.\n\nBy 34 ABY, that location had been named Oga's Cantina after its owner, Oga Garra, and it continued to serve the beverage during breakfast hours. In his Traveler's Guide to Batuu, author Eloc Throno described the Moogan Tea served at Oga's Cantina as \"well-garnished.\"\n\nThe Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs claimed that any respectable barkeep would know how to make real Moogan Tea from the original recipe, and he believed it was likely worth risking legal ramifications to have a taste. In 34 ABY, he took a risk himself with his cookbook The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook; it included his recipes for Moogan Tea made with his personal blend of Moogan Spice Syrup and a Christophsian sugar topping.\n\n",

There existed many types of tea. One was made from the florets of the Cassius tree. Another, known as Tarine tea, was served on planets as diverse as Lothal and Christophsis. Gatalenta was a planet famous for its tea. One tea was the Deychin tea. While some varieties of tea were consumed hot, others were served cold, such as Moogan Tea or its corporate-branded version, Ardees Beverage, which came in bottles or as a fizzy canned tea. Teahouses were establishments dedicated to the serving of tea. Sky Graf had fifty-seven percent oxidized green Orsh Mountain tea onboard the Brightbird which he served to Rooper Nitani on Batuu.\n\nAt some point during the Clone Wars, smugglers led by a Moogan named Tee Va came to Sundari, the capital city of Mandalore, where they distributed Ardees beverage tea diluted with slabin, a hazardous chemical. As a result, Tee Va's profits were doubled, but many Sundari schoolchildren became ill. However, due to to an investigation run by the Duchess of Mandalore, Satine Kryze, and the Galactic Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Tee Va and his smugglers were arrested.\n\n",

In 34 ABY, Tuggs published his cookbook The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which included recipes for his imitation syrup and the Dagobah Slug Slinger. The same year, the historian Eloc Throno included a photo of Dagobah Slug Slinger in Batuu guidebook, Traveler's Guide to Batuu, listing it as one of Oga's Cantina's offerings.\n\nAt some point no earlier than 35 ABY, Galactic Society of Creature Enthusiasts' Director of Creature Cartography, Ardis San Tekka, and her safari droid B8-T5 visited Batuu while studying non-sentient creatures throughout the galaxy. While in Oga's Cantina, San Tekka tasted a Dagobah Slug Slinger while her droid conversed with the cantia's DJ, R-3X. Later, B8-T5 mentioned his owner consumption of a Dagobah Slug Slinger in an annotation in her journal, within a section about swamp slugs. In the same publication, San Tekka noted that the decadence of the swamp slugs' slime had led to smaller specimens of the species being exported from Dagobah and kept in captivity for chefs to harvest from them for dishes and drinks.\n\n",

        "content": "# Dagobah Slug Slinger - Description[]\n\nThe Dagobah Slug Slinger was a green-colored cocktail named after swamp slugs, a native species of the swamp planet Dagobah. The large slugs secreted saccharine slime with fragrant notes from the herbs they had digested, and the slime was used to sweeten desserts and drinks. The cocktail's combination of sweet and herbaceous slime plus a tart citrus juice base masked its strong alcoholic content, which was said to have a stronger kick than a master of the martial art Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si. The drink was garnished with a sprig of an herb.\n\n",

        "content": "# Miss Mylla's Saloon - History[]\n\nMiss Mylla, an exotic female Falleen of mysterious origin, went to Lamaredd in a passenger ship at some point before 69 BBY. She arrived in the company of dozen of Falleen escorts and, for as long as anyone can remember, was escorted by the massive Chagrian known as \"Bantha\" Burloo.\n\nMiss Mylla fixed her gaze in the dull building that served as local inn and acquired it. In no time, she refurnished it and transformed the structure into \"Miss Mylla's Saloon\", a 24-hour business offering a variety of services. Customers could enjoy a good drink served by any of the beautiful, scantily-clad waitresses \u2014her travel companions\u2014 or gamble in any of the tables, listening the music and talking. It was also an economic hotel. The waitresses also provided an undisclosed second service, euphemistically known as \"the work\", for reduced groups in the private rooms of the top floor. Burloo on his own provided the security with his mere, but constant, presence in the door; rarely he needed to take a ruffian out of the door.\n\nFrom the very first moment, the business thrived and Miss Mylla's Saloon became the busiest and most popular venture in the Center Sphere District \u2014 although Nyubuna Bulul's The Even Cut Sabacc Parlor and Casino just in front of the door provided a rival alternative in the form of only gambling. In little time, Miss Mylla had a need for more employees, whom she called \"her girls.\"\n\nThe courtesans doubled as waitress, with some of them preferring one activity over the other. Knowing that inebriated, overexcited customers could tend to overlook certain limits, Miss Mylla made sure that patrons treated \"her girls\" with due respect, and provided each of the girls with a knife \u2014 not to mention Burloo's attentive eye.\n\nMiss Mylla also encouraged her employees to make themselves a life beyond that. Whenever any of them wanted to leave, Miss Mylla arranged things to give that person an offworld education for other field and, in at least one case, marrying the fortunate girl with a Falleen prince. Those former employees always considered Mylla to be their guardian.\n\nAs of c. 29 BBY, several important citizens of the Landing were also regular patrons, including the Security Chief's Senior Second Grubber Vapps, the Security Chief Mix Liddell \u2014who had some kind of personal romatic relationship with Miss Mylla\u2014 and Guther Bartyn, mayor of the town council, Administrator of the local mines, owner of Bartyn Gourmet Delicacies and a usual of the top floor.\n\nAround that time, one of the working girls had decided to leave this field of activity, with Miss Mylla approvingly accepting that the Human woman had never been made for that. Miss Mylla arranged her retirement, sending her in the form of a package to a legitimate business partner of Miss Mylla in the remote Cape Regret.\n\nIn the times immediately after the public reappearance of the thought-extinct Menahuun species, two of Miss Mylla's girls disappeared along with their customer in the lowlands of Maw range. She admitted that it had happened before, but she was nevertheless worried.\n\nAt the same time, the shipments of Corellian brandy for the Saloon were being seized by corrupt officers of the spaceport security for their personal use. Miss Mylla suspected what was happening \u2014although she was blissfully unaware of the existence of an organize smuggling ring\u2014 but she refused to turn to Chief Lidell once again, as the case could put him in conflict with his own bosses.\n\nDue to a series of events, Lidell hired a group of outsiders as his new Seconds. He suggested them to live in Miss Mylla's Saloon, and offered to pay for the rooms \u2014 only.\n\n",
