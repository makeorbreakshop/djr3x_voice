Posters were put up around Galactic City in order to promote Coruscant Nights.\n\nThere were at least two two different poster designs: The first one showed white text on a dark background and read \"Max Reebo [sic]\" \u2013 \"Coruscant Nights\". The other poster showed the silhouette of two people against a blue background, and said \"Coruscant Nights\" at the top and \"Coruscant Ballroom\" at the bottom. Fifteen years after the Clone Wars ended, the first poster was used to decorate the walls of the Ghost.\n\n",

They were common on the planet Coruscant, where a series of billboards were put up in order to advertise them, and attract potential customers. One video store was located at the corner of twelfth and G on Level 1312, next to a hotel building, although the sign was upside-down, and another sign was lying dumped on the ground nearby. Another video store was located on Level 1313, although once again, the sign was upside-down. Yet another video store was located at the wharf, where several signs were put up on a building lying next to a lake.\n\nVideo stores were also present in the central marketplace of Ro Station on Pantora, which featured a similar series of billboards, but with a different motif. The stylized multicolored motif featured on the Pantoran billboards, resembling a kneeling figure, was also featured on an alcoholic beverage served on Coruscant.\n\nOne video store was known as Pawp and was present on both Coruscant and Pantora, where a third set of billboards was used to advertise the business.\n\n",
