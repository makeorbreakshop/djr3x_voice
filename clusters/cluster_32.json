        "content": "# Star Tours - History[]\n\nThe Star Tours travel agency existed around the time of the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict that broke out in 22 BBY. At the time, the company notably organized tours to Glee Anselm, a water planet with tropical climate. However, the starline greatly expanded its business at some point between 1 and 0 BBY under new management, opening a new intergalactic space terminal on a space station in the Earth system, which it shared with fellow member companies of the Galactic Tourist Bureau. The agency hoped to promote unrestricted travel through the galaxy despite the Empire's oppression. Alderaanian Captain Raymus Antilles assisted in the launch of the expanded spaceline by assigning droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to help launch their new spaceport.\n\nFlights had a non-smoking policy, which, according to droid G2-9T, also extended to luggage. In addition, there was a policy against smuggling droids in the luggage, although G2-9T often turned a blind eye. Animals were also barred from entering flights, requiring that any animals found in luggage be placed in quarantine. Passengers were required to wear flight glasses during trips. In addition, passengers were sometimes required to bring with them Imperial authorization forms to access certain destinations, such as Bothan Space, and were also forbidden from accepting packages from unidentified individuals.\n\nOn an early voyage, prior to the ship's departure from the terminal, Imperial agents discovered the presence of a Rebel spy on board and attempted to arrest the Rebel. The vessel took off and fought its way past Imperial ships surrounding the space station, crippling an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer in the process. After being chased through hyperspace, the StarSpeeder 1000 landed and delivered the spy to safety.\n\nAt the time of the Battle of Yavin, Star Tours' space cruiser Tzarina was involved in a tragic accident that cost most of its passengers their lives. For unknown reasons the ship's droid captain decided to change course towards Yavin to show his passengers \"something neat.\" Once there, the yacht collided with an unidentified TIE fighter variant that was tumbling out of control through space. The collision caused the Tzarina's hyperdrive to initiate and throw the ship into hyperspace. When it fell out of hyperspace half a galaxy away, it crash-landed on Dathomir in the Quelii sector. Only one passenger was known to survive the crash and find his way to the Dathomir Trade Outpost, where he told others his story.\n\nImmediately following the Battle of Endor, Star Tours sought to capitalize on the Moddell sector's sudden fame by promising \"convenient daily departures to the exotic moon of Endor\" along the decaying Sanctuary Pipeline. During this time, C-3PO and R2-D2 again briefly worked for the agency, having been placed on temporary loan by the agency while their owners in the New Republic were fighting against the Tofs during the Nagai-Tof invasion. One pilot for this flight, RX-24, failed to actually make it to the Endor moon and instead sped quickly out of the system and into a battle between the New Republic and remnants of the Galactic Empire along with the third Death Star.\n\nSeveral months later, after a variety of accidents and mismanagement, the company was driven out of business.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Tours - Behind the scenes[]\n\nStar Tours is a theme-park attraction located at Tomorrowland in Disneyland, as well as at three other Disney theme parks, including the filmmaking-oriented Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World.\n\nOriginally opened at Disneyland in 1987 with a single flight, the Endor Express, Star Tours has since been re-imagined so that as many as 54 different experiences are available to passengers. Destinations now include Coruscant, Naboo, Tatooine, Hoth, Kashyyyk, Geonosis, and the first Death Star.\n\nReferences to Star Tours have appeared in various Expanded Universe sources, and a number of action figures based on the attraction's droids, particularly RX-24 (\"Rex\"), have been released.\n\nThe canonicity of the events depicted in the original Star Tours experience has been disputed for many reasons, the most obvious being the inclusion of the Death Star. R2-D2's presence aboard the StarSpeeder 3000 precludes the events taking place during the Battle of Yavin or the Battle of Endor, and the Death Star seen in the ride does not have the skeletal appearance of the Death Star prototype constructed at The Maw; additionally, Endor is far from The Maw, and R2-D2 is accounted for during the major battle over the prototype, as well. This may have indicated it was an unrevealed Death Star or, as some suggested, a modified habitation sphere. Leland Chee tentatively named it Death Star III, and it was later confirmed canon within Legends in the StarWars.com blog post Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours. This post also placed the event in question during the Nagai\u2013Tof War to explain C-3PO and R2-D2's presence in the ride.\n\nIn Star Wars: TIE Fighter, a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle called Startour 7 can be inspected by the player during one of the TIE Interceptor training missions, although it is unclear whether it had any actual affiliation with the company besides name and it carrying tourists.\n\nIn the Tokyo Disneyland version of the ride, additional planets/astro locations were added in as visitable locales: specifically, the desert world of Bar Neth, the water world of Praya, and the Edge of the Galaxy. These locations as well as the footage were in fact reused from the three endings for the defunct Epcot ride Horizons, regarding the Mesa Verde, Sea Castle, and Space Colony Brava Centauri, respectively. The endings and scenarios from that ride dealt with the concepts of arid-zone agriculture, ocean colonization, and space colonization, respectively.\n\nThe Star Tours Travel Agency has been compared to real-life airlines, including how they operate in loading passengers onto flights.\n\n",

Despite the agency's claim that the ships were highly advanced, they were often in need of repair.\n\nStar Tours used other ships besides the StarSpeeder. The ill-fated Tzarina was a Corellian vessel similar to a CR70 or CR90 corvette.\n\n",

Sequel-trilogy-era variants are non-canon.\n\nAs the ship prepares to leave the hangar, Darth Vader flies into view on a Hover Platform, flanked by Sky troopers and stormtroopers to prevent the ship from leaving. A video screen identifies one of the passengers as a Rebel spy. Vader uses the Force to stop the ship until R2-D2 fires the laser cannons, and the StarSpeeder exits the hangar backwards and is a chased by TIE fighters. The ship then evades Star Destroyers and escapes into hyperspace. Alternate version: In another version of the scene, Boba Fett joins Vader and the Sky troopers.\nWhile the StarSpeeder is docked near the Millennium Falcon and Han Solo, a droid scans the ship and one of the passengers is identified as a Rebel spy, while outside Solo gets into a firefight with stormtroopers. The StarSpeeder then follows the Falcon as it flees the hangar and flies past Star Destroyers (causing severe damage to the bridge of one) before entering hyperspace.\nNon-canon: In a scene patterned after the original Darth Vader scene, Kylo Ren and First Order stormtroopers arrive, and Ren uses the Force to prevent the ship from leaving. After he identifies a spy and \"traitor to the First Order,\" R2-D2 opens fires, and the ship flees as in the earlier version. (Added in 2017 to promote The Last Jedi.)\nNon-canon: In a scene similar to the probe droid scene featuring Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon, First Order stormtroopers join the droid while Rey and BB-8 replace Solo as they flee in the Falcon. (Added in 2017 to promote The Last Jedi.)\nNon-canon: In another variation of the probe droid scene, it is Ahsoka Tano's T-6 1974 ship that flees the stormtroopers with the StarSpeeder following close behind.

Thanks to an inexperienced and thoroughly incompetent droid pilot named RX-24, what was billed as a leisurely tour to the Endor moon became a wild ride as the tour got caught up in a battle between the Empire and the Rebels.\n\nThe first incarnation of the ride appeared in Tomorrowland at Disneyland in 1987, replacing the attraction Adventure Thru Inner Space.

        "content": "# Star Tours (real-world) - Plot summary[]\n\nAdvertised as \"The Ultimate Star Wars Adventure!,\" Star Tours puts the guest in the role of a space tourist en route to the Forest Moon of Endor via the \"Star Tours\" travel agency. Much is made of this throughout the ride queue, and the design and theme of the inside holding area is convincingly modeled to look like a spaceship boarding terminal. This area is stocked with Audio-Animatronic characters that seem to interact with the ride patrons including Mon Calamari technicians and versions of C-3PO and R2-D2, as well as a life-size mock-up of the StarSpeeder 3000, the \"starship\" that guests embark on. The figures of C-3PO and R2-D2 in the Disneyland park are actual props from the original film trilogy, modified to operate via Audio-Animatronics.\n\nOnce guests reach the head of the line, the ride operators escort them into one of several ride theaters. As the doors close, the ship's bumbling RX-24 pilot droid, a.k.a. \"Rex\" (voiced by Paul Reubens), chats up the guests about the trip as he sets up. All goes well until a slight mistake on Rex's part sends the ship down the wrong tunnel and plummeting into a maintenance yard, just managing to escape into open space before a giant mechanical appendage nearly crushes the ship.\n\nOnce in space, the ship enters hyperspace, but Rex disengages its hyperdrives too late to stop at the ship's intended destination\u2014and instead gets caught inside a comet field. The ship becomes trapped inside one of the larger comets and has to navigate its way out through a maze of passages and chambers. Just when all the trouble seems to be over, the ship encounters a Star Destroyer and finds itself caught in its tractor beam. However, a timely attack (providing assistance by destroying the tractor beam generator) by a Rebel X-wing fighter allows them to escape. Soon the ship and its tourists find themselves accompanying the Rebellion on a massive assault on the Death Star (which Death Star is unspecified). Rex uses the StarSpeeder's lasers to eliminate TIE/LN starfighters while a Rebel destroys the Death Star in the same manner as Luke Skywalker does in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. A final light-speed jump sends the StarSpeeder back to where it started, but not before a near-collision with a fuel truck in the spaceport.\n\n",

In all, the various options resulted in 54 possible combinations.\n\nTwo new segments added in 2015 to promote The Force Awakens were locked into place for the duration of the Season of the Force event, after which the randomization was re-enabled. Additionally, variations of existing segments created in 2011 were activated for the first time, increasing variability further during the lock. The 2017 addition of material to promote The Last Jedi brought in more sequel trilogy content to create a full experience focused on the era as a result of criticism of the Jakku segment mismatching the rest of the attraction. The 2019 addition of The Rise of Skywalker material, initially presented as a locked experience, allowed the sequel trilogy to share more of the original unpredictability by providing two additional planets to shuffle through when the lock was removed.\n\n2024 saw the addition of Seatos as a second planet option and additional hologram messages from Cassian Andor, Ahsoka Tano with Huyang and Chopper, and Din Djarin with Grogu. While Ahsoka and Cassian specifically reference the Rebellion, Din's message is more ambiguous. Scenes based on the sequel trilogy and new canon television series are considered non-canon since the original ride is part of the Legends continuity.\n\n",

R2 takes care of one droid, while the others are knocked off in the battle. The ship then flies through the city traffic below before reaching a landing platform, where a number of parked StarSpeeders can be found. An alternate option added later has the Millennium Falcon and Chewbacca appear on the platform instead.\nSkirmish over Naboo: The StarSpeeder reaches Naboo in the middle of a space battle. The ship then follows a group of N-1 starfighters to the surface, and eventually lands in the ocean near a Gungan city, either dodging or crashing into Jar Jar Binks upon arrival. After traveling through the planet core and encountering dangerous sea creatures, the ship launches back to the surface and crash-lands in a Rebel hangar, where it crashes into an N-1. The N-1's tail ends up inside the craft, smashing into the viewport, as a pit droid angrily shouts at Threepio. Alternatively, the StarSpeeder only breaks the tail of the N-1 off, angering the pit droid working on it, resulting in him throwing paint onto the viewport.\nSkirmish at Geonosis: In the Geonosis asteroid belt, the StarSpeeder is chased by Boba Fett in Slave I. The ship escapes but then encounters the incomplete, first Death Star while pursued by Vader and his TIE pilots. The ship escapes by flying right through the unfinished Death Star, but are then met again by Boba, who shoots a seismic charge at the ship. The StarSpeeder shoots it back, evading him and then heads into hyperspace to meet up with the Rebel fleet and land in the Home One's hangar bay.\nNon-canon: Battle of Crait: The StarSpeeder arrives on Crait in the middle of the battle between the First Order and the Resistance. After escaping Tie Fighters by going through a cave, the StarSpeeder re-emerges in the midst of a battle with a group of All Terrain MegaCaliber Sixes and after taking down a few, the ship escapes to hyperspace. (Added it 2017 to promote The Last Jedi.)\nNon-canon: Battle of Exegol: The StarSpeeder arrives in the skies over Exegol, where the Resistance is engaging the Sith Eternal forces. As we dodge shots and debris in the chaotic battle, a frightened 3PO tells us he was happy to have us as passengers assuming we won't make it. After knocking a broken Sith TIE fighter off the ship's viewport, the StarSpeeder helps take out a Xyston-class Star Destroyer and then jumps back into hyperspace. (Added in 2019 to promote The Rise of Skywalker.)\nNon-canon: Incident on Seatos: Arriving in the skies of Seatos, the StarSpeeder finds themselves in the middle of a pod of Purrgil while the T-6 1974 is engaged in battle with two RP82 Fiend fighters, with Ahsoka asking for assistance. Weaving through the tentacles and avoiding being swallowed by one of the Purrgils, the StarSpeeder is able to take out one of the fighters and R2 has the ship spin in triumph to imitate Ahsoka's ship. Before the ship jumps away, Ahsoka wishes us safe travels and remarks that it was good to see R2 again. (Added in 2024 to promote Ahsoka.)\nNon-canon: If visiting sequel trilogy locations and Seatos, one of two additional ending scenes occurs. In one version, the ship escapes to Batuu, where C-3PO muses that their adventure is just beginning. Alternatively, the StarSpeeder returns to Spaceport THX1138. After dodging several outgoing ships, we land on a lower level, frightening a group of pit droids and catching the ire of AC-38, who approaches StarSpeeder demanding an explanation before the viewport shield closes.\n\n",

With the opening of Star Tours at Disneyland Paris, the designers added a new robot to the queue area of the attraction, ROX-N, whom they designed as Rex's girlfriend. Expansion to new parks meant finding new voice talents for non-English versions of the ride; for Disneyland Paris, the company cast voice actor Luq Hamet to portray Rex.\n\nWhen Lucasfilm and Disney teamed up again to update Star Tours in 2005, designers decided to set the new version in the era between Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, well before the timeframe of the original ride. To preserve continuity with the original ride, wherein Rex tells guests that it is his first flight, the team decided to create a new pilot. The droid AC-38 (\"Ace\") was the result, and the new pilot exhibits similar physical and behavioral features to Rex. Nevertheless, the newer ride's plot sees the protocol droid C-3PO replace Ace by mistake. As a nod to the original ride, the designers included an RX-24 animatronic puppet in the queuing area audience members must pass through as they wait to board the attraction. There, the pilot-to-be is non-functioning and marked defective, uttering lines from the original Star Tours seemingly at random.

        "content": "# Star Tours (real-world) - Development[]\n\nThe ride that became Star Tours first saw light as a proposal for an attraction based on the 1979 Disney live-action flop The Black Hole. It was planned as an interactive ride simulator attraction, where guests would have had the ability to choose the ride car's route. After preliminary planning, the Black Hole attraction was shelved due to its enormous cost (approximately $50 million US) as well as the unpopularity of the film itself.\n\nWith his approval, Disney Imagineers purchased four large military flight simulators at a cost of $500,000 each and designed the ride structure. Meanwhile, Lucas and his team of special-effects technicians at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) worked on the first-person-perspective film that would be projected inside the simulators. When both simulator and film were completed, a programmer then sat inside and, with the aid of a joystick, manually synchronized the movement of the simulator with the apparent movement on the film. On January 9, 1987, at a final cost of $32 million (almost twice the cost of building the entire park in 1955), the ride finally opened to throngs of patrons, many of whom dressed as Star Wars characters for the occasion. In celebration, Disneyland remained open for a special 60-hour marathon from 10:00am on January 9, 1987 to 10:00pm on January 11, 1987.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Tours (real-world) - Continuity[]\n\nInitially a date for the events of the original Star Tours was not specified. Press materials at the time of the attraction's opening did place it after the events of Return of the Jedi, while C-3PO's dialogue refers to his visits to various planets as happening in the past, including the events of his capture by the Ewoks. The Complete Guide to Star Tours booklet made available at Tokyo Disneyland further confirmed the setting.\n\nSome were led to question whether or not the ride was canon in the Star Wars universe, mostly due to the inclusion of an attack on the Death Star, including a trench run similar to that seen in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Though early press material suggested the space station was a new Death Star appearing after Return of the Jedi, no sources that followed offered an explanation for that station for many years.\n\nIn 2005, Lucasfilm's Leland Chee first used the term \"Death Star III\" and placed its destruction a few months after the Battle of Endor in a blog post. This was later confirmed as canon in the article Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours on StarWars.com, though no explanation was given for the station. That article also set the events of the ride during the Nagai\u2013Tof War, shown to be happening months after Return of the Jedi in the Marvel Star Wars comic series. Some fans had speculated that the Death Star could have been modification of one of the habitation spheres seen under construction over Coruscant. This was later confirmed in Supreme Commander Ennix Devian's entry for the second part of the blog series The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire.\n\nAs with all material released prior to April 25, 2014, questions of canonicity regarding Star Tours apply only to the continuity of the Expanded Universe, now known as Star Wars Legends, and its story is considered entirely non-canon within the current continuity.\n\n",

Creating the film to be projected to audience members proved a challenge, since all the drama had to come from either the visuals created by Industrial Light & Magic or from dialogue; the ride, therefore, needed a compelling and sympathetic narrator.\n\nGeorge Lucas proposed a droid pilot for the role to help connect audience members to the greater experience the ride was intended to mimic. Lucas's original idea for the robot was to call him \"Crazy Harry\" and make him a sarcastic, wisecracking veteran of the Clone Wars, an idea based on the skippers of the Jungle Cruise attraction in the park's Adventureland area in the 1980s. However, the ride's director, Tony Baxter, suggested the pilot be more of a jittery beginner and that the ride's harrowing narrative arise from the pilot's beginner's blunder; such a character would be more sympathetic, Baxter suggested. The team ran with the idea, also making the robot a stand-in for the audience members. For instance, the team felt that the pilot's insistence on participating in an attack run on a Death Star\u2014along with his exclamation, \"I've always wanted to do this!\"\u2014would mirror the feelings of anyone who had seen Luke Skywalker's trench run in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Tours (real-world) - Marketing[]\n\nWhen the ride opened, Star Tours press kits were released. They each contained interviews with George Lucas, Disney's Michael Eisner, and C-3PO. The video portion of the kit lasts about an hour, with a large part of it devoted to the ride's opening ceremony, and a play with actors dressed as Luke, Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and Darth Vader\u2014dancing around and acting out several scenes from the Star Wars films.\n\nThere was also a TV special that aired around the time of the opening of the ride. The program\u2014entitled George Lucas' Star Tours and designed to promote the ride\u2014aired in late 1986, and was hosted by Gil Gerard and Ernie Reyes Jr.. The show looks at how Star Tours was made, as well as the history of space travel and space-related films. Some highlights of the program include a segment at the beginning, where C-3PO and R2-D2 make an appearance and perform a rap song, as well as a segment at the end, where Reyes boards the StarSpeeder 3000\u2014giving away some teasers of the ride itself.\n\nAs part of the Star Tours experience, upon exiting the StarSpeeder 3000, passengers are led to a store which sells merchandise based on Star Wars and the ride itself. This includes action figures, clothing, etc. At Disneyland the store is The Star Trader. At Disney's Hollywood Studios, the store was originally called Endor Vendors, and had a theme based on Endor with a facade modeled after the back door of the Endor shield generator bunker. Around the release of Episode I, that store was replaced by Tatooine Traders, themed to resemble the buildings of Mos Eisley and Mos Espa. Both stores included some exclusive merchandise sold only at Disney theme parks, including action figures of the various droids seen in the ride and queue and StarSpeeder 3000 toys.\n\n",

        "content": "# RX-24 - Characteristics[]\n\nRX-24 was a standard RX-series model, making him a class two droid, that is, one of a category of droids who aided in spaceflight and vehicle or starship maintenance. He possessed standard equipment for his model, including three clawed arms with which to manipulate starship controls, a heuristic processor to facilitate learning and creativity, two photoreceptors with which to see, a repulsorlift platform at his base for locomotion, and a vocabulator with which to speak. The droid was programmed with a masculine personality, and he was able to speak and understand Basic and Binary. Rex's photoreceptors were blue unless illuminated, which made them shine with a white light. The wider sections of his chassis were burnished metal trimmed with gold and purple; between these were narrower sections in black. Rex's clawed fingers, upper anterior facial plating, and vocabulator were also gold. The droid pilot had a retractable purple visor that he could lower over his photoreceptors.\n\nUpon his arrival at the Star Tours travel agency, RX-24 suffered from severe factory defects, sputtering random phrases and shorting out frequently. Once restored to normal working order, Rex enjoyed the same programming as other RX units. He was skilled at starship piloting, ship maintenance, and computer use. His photoreceptors had great acuity to allow him to efficiently locate obstacles in spaceflight, and his dexterity enabled him to fly through dangerous situations. Nevertheless, Rex had yet to become accustomed to actual spaceflight on his first mission; indeed, he exhibited some confusion and insecurity on the flight, nearly crashing the StarSpeeder 3000 and narrowly escaping several other hazards. Ultimately, his reflexes and daring allowed him to return to the Star Tours dock intact.\n\nSimilarly, the fully functional Rex exhibited his model's ease of interaction with organic beings. He was friendly and upbeat even in dire situations. When his first flight went awry, he tried to keep a professional veneer of calm, claiming that some of his mistakes had been intentional. Still, his anxieties manifested at particularly harrowing moments in screams and cries of exasperation. Despite his claims that he wanted to keep his passengers safe, RX-24 showed a daredevil streak on his maiden voyage; for instance, when he stumbled upon an Imperial battlestation, he chose to join a New Republic attack on it rather than retreat to safety. The pilot droid interacted smoothly with other mechanicals, such as his first navigator, R2-D2, as well as RX-24's romantic interest, ROX-N.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Tours: The Adventures Continue - Continuity[]\n\nAccording to \"The Incredible Journey,\" an article in Star Wars Insider 127, the events of Star Tours: The Adventures Continue occurred at some point between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. While the attraction itself did not provide precise data about its chronology, Admiral Ackbar's appearance set it after his rescue from Imperial slavery in 1 BBY, and droid G2-9T's comment about the Yavin 4 Rebel headquarters also places it after that date. The Star Wars Blog article Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours finally placed the ride's date at about 1 BBY.\n\nThe seasonal Season of the Force version of the attraction, which included a scene set on Jakku, characters Finn and BB-8 and the First Order, was anachronistic with the timeline presented throughout the rest of the attraction. In one scene, riders were confronted by Darth Vader, and encountered Finn in the next. It can be assumed that the events presented in these scenes are non-canon. Further Sequel trilogy additions in 2017 smoothed out some of these issues by creating a new Kylo Ren intro and a reworked version of the scanning droid intro featuring First Order stormtroopers. The attraction is still randomized, but each flight includes either original content entirely based on Episodes I to VI, or entirely based on Episodes VII to IX. This avoids the most glaring continuity issues.\n\n",

The masculine-programmed droid was purchased by the Star Tours travel agency at some point after the rise of the Galactic Empire, and prior to 1 BBY, but he was defective as of 1 BBY and saw no service until after the company upgraded its fleet of StarSpeeder 1000 spacecraft to the newer StarSpeeder 3000 sometime around the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. By that time, RX-24 had been repaired, and the company placed him into service. His initial duty to Star Tours constituted multiple firsts: Rex's first flight as a pilot, the first official Star Tours use of the StarSpeeder 3000 shuttle, and the first outing of the Endor Express with non-stop service to the Forest Moon of Endor. With the astromech droid R2-D2 as his copilot, Rex took off on Star Tours Flight 45. He never reached Endor. Instead, Rex nearly crashed the shuttle leaving the spaceport, emerged from hyperspace too late and overshot the Forest Moon, stumbled into a comet field, wandered into a battle between New Republic and Imperial forces, and joined an attack run on an Imperial battlestation. The pilot droid then returned to the spaceport from which the flight originated.\n\nRex's programming and appearance were standard for the RX series. He had a segmented body with wider sections of burnished metal trimmed in gold and purple, and narrower sections in black. He had three arms with clawed hands, blue photoreceptors that glowed with a white light, a retractable purple visor, and a repulsorlift generator at his base to facilitate movement. Rex was friendly with organic beings, and he affected a brave demeanor even during his disastrous flight to Endor. Fellow droid ROX-N was known to have romantic feelings toward Rex.\n\n",

The idea that Rex had lost control of the StarSpeeder suggested the character would need to scream frequently on the audio track. Tom Fitzgerald, lead writer and producer on the project, and Mark Eades, media producer for the ride, have both claimed credit for eventually casting comedian Paul Reubens for the role. Fitzgerald says that he thought Reubens might fit the bill after seeing the comedian's television special as the character Pee-wee Herman, a role that required Reubens to scream frequently and humorously. Fitzgerald felt the actor would fit the idea of a slightly comical, inexperienced pilot well. Eades's version of the story says that in seeking a voice actor who could portray a \"slightly cracked' character, they auditioned over two dozen talents, including Billy Barty and Frank Welker. When Eades heard Reubens as the voice of a robot spaceship in the Disney film Flight of the Navigator, he thought the comedian would suit the part. Reubens soon signed on to the project.\n\nLucas provided basic ideas for Rex's physical appearance. Based on these, Imagineer Chris Runco sculpted a prototype Rex puppet from green foam. Two other ride designers, Larry Sheldon and Lance Updyke, used this template to create the Rex puppets from aluminum. With four separate StarSpeeder 3000s that audience members might board in the attraction after its opening in 1987, four separate animatronic Rex puppets were also needed. The character first appeared in a 1986 TV promotion that aired on ABC's Sunday Night Movie feature, shortly before the ride officially opened at the start of the next year.\n\n",

        "content": "# RX-24 - Biography[]\n\nRX-24 was an RX-series pilot droid manufactured by Reubens Robotic Systems. The droid was one of several purchased by the galactic travel agency known as Star Tours circa 1 BBY. RX-24 was shipped to the agency defective; once removed from his shipping crate, the droid was almost completely non-functional, muttering random phrases in Basic, speeding up and slowing down his speech at irregular intervals, and sparking at the neck. With a decal reading, \"DEFECTIVE\" and \"RETURN TO FACTORY\" on his base, he sat outside his crate up to the time of Star Tours Flight 1401, which took place at some point between 2 and 0 BBY. Nevertheless, Star Tours decided to keep RX-24 at the company and had its in-house repair droids restore him to working order.\n\nBy 4.3 ABY, shortly after the Battle of Endor, RX-24 had been brought online as a fully functional pilot droid. He also struck up a romantic relationship with another Star Tours droid, ROX-N. Star Tours had upgraded its fleet of StarSpeeder 1000 passenger starships to the newer StarSpeeder 3000 model. Seeking to cash in on the moon of Endor's sudden fame after the defeat of Galactic Emperor Palpatine by the Alliance to Restore the Republic there, Star Tours assigned RX-24, now nicknamed \"Rex,\" to captain the StarSpeeder 3000 on its maiden voyage, taking it to the forest moon with a full complement of passengers as part of the newly implemented Endor Express service. Rex was to follow the Sanctuary Pipeline, a hyperlane that had been created by the Galactic Empire to bring supplies to the Endor system during the construction of the Death Star II battle station. Without the Empire to maintain the hyperroute, however, the Pipeline began to decay soon after the battle had ended. Nevertheless, Star Tours gave the go-ahead for Rex to pilot Star Tours Flight 45 (ST-45). Only the protocol droid C-3PO, temporarily working for the travel agency, saw the folly of the plan, noting that Rex still had his \"Remove Before Flight\" factory tag on him.\n\nRex took his post in front of the StarSpeeder's cockpit shield. Promising a smooth ride, the droid lowered the shield and greeted his passengers as his navigator, R2-D2, was loaded into the craft's astromech slot. With approval from control, Rex lurched the starship into motion but then took a wrong turn while still inside the Star Tours spaceport. Unable to find the StarSpeeder 3000's brakes, he nearly collided with a wall before wrenching the craft up and over the obstruction and into space. Despite this inauspicious beginning, RX-24 then ordered R2-D2 to launch the craft into hyperspace.\n\nThe pilot's next mistake was to come out of lightspeed too late, passing Endor completely and inadvertently moving the StarSpeeder into a field of icy comets instead. He deftly piloted the craft through the comet field only to emerge within a restricted combat zone, where several New Republic X-wing starfighters were in the midst of a battle with an Imperial Star Destroyer and its complement of TIE/LN starfighters. Rex found his passenger craft caught in the Star Destroyer's tractor beam, but a tip from one of the New Republic pilots to ease up on his main thruster allowed the droid to escape capture. The voyage nearly came to an end when an Imperial fighter shot the ship and caused it to lose altitude, but R2-D2 repaired the damaged stabilizer on the Captain's orders. Rex then moved the starship to join the New Republic's Red Squadron in an attack run against a massive Imperial battlestation. After following two X-wings through a giant trench and helping them shoot down enemy TIE fighters, Rex and his passengers saw that the attack was a success. Rex then ordered R2-D2 to take the craft to lightspeed; they returned to the spaceport from which Flight ST-45 had originated, scathed but intact.\n\nRX-24's flight proved something of a harbinger for the future of the Star Tours travel agency. Within months of the Battle of Endor, accidents and poor management drove the company to go out of business.\n\n",

They were removed from the show during the last 2 years of its run. The droids can be heard singing variations of \"I've been working on the railroad, all the livelong day,\" a reference to the song sung by the geese. The New Essential Guide to Droids nicknamed the G2s \"Goose droids\" as a nod to this show.\n\nIn the ride queue, after G2-9T somehow starts causing alarms to go off and gets a call from his supervisor, the droid at one point says \"Uh, everything's perfectly alright now, w-we're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. Uh, how are you?,\" a paraphrase of a line spoken by Han Solo in A New Hope. He also says \"Boring conversation, anyway\" after cutting his supervisor off mid-sentence, which was also in the scene from the film.\n\nOne of the items scanned in the luggage by G2-9T was a Goofy doll, prompting him to say that the design was \"really goofy.\" When finding a Goofy hat in another luggage set, G2-9T will mistake it for a Jar Jar Binks styled hat. A Chip and Dale doll set seen in scanned luggage has G2-9T calling them clones. Upon discovering the magic lamp from Aladdin, he mentions that the Star Tours' non-smoking policy extends to luggage as well.\n\nWALL-E, from the Pixar film of the same name, can also be seen in one of the scans, attempting to get G2-9T's attention. G2-9T fails to see this, and clears the suitcase without noticing. Other luggage cameos include Madame Leota from the Haunted Mansion, a Stitch plush, Sorcerer Mickey's hat from Fantasia, Mike Wazowski's teddy bear from Monsters Inc., Indiana Jones's hat and whip, the Mighty Microscope and a snowflake from Adventure Thru Inner Space, and V.I.N.CENT from The Black Hole.\n\n",

        "content": "# RX-series pilot droid - Behind the scenes[]\n\nRX-24, the first RX-series droid in Star Wars canon, was designed as the pilot for the joint Lucasfilm\u2013Walt Disney Company attraction Star Tours, for Disney's Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. Because the ride was designed as a spaceflight simulator, the creative team decided to tailor the ride experience to being on a passenger liner, with all action experienced in the first person. Such a premise necessitated the creation of a relatable narrator and guide to engage the audience throughout the ride's duration. Star Wars creator George Lucas suggested that a droid pilot might be able to serve that function, and he proposed a droid version of the skippers of the Jungle Cruise ride in Disneyland's Adventureland area in the 1980s; the droid version would be a sardonic Clone Wars veteran. Tony Baxter, the director of the ride's development, suggested instead that the droid be more nervous than cynical, a jumpy neophyte pilot whose errors set the conflict of the story in motion. The team developed the idea into Captain Rex.\n\nBased on preliminary ideas from Lucas, Disney Imagineer Chris Runco created a prototype Rex puppet in green foam. Larry Sheldon and Lance Updyke, two other ride designers, then crafted the Rex puppets from aluminum based on Runco's design. Four separate animatronic Rexes were created to man each of the four different StarSpeeder 3000s available to visitors to the Star Tours ride when it opened in 1987. As the attraction was recreated and expanded upon in various Disney theme parks, further RX-24 pilots were constructed as well.\n\nFor years, Rex remained the only droid of his kind in Star Wars continuity. In 2008, however, the Scum and Villainy sourcebook for the Saga Edition of the Wizards of the Coast Star Wars Roleplaying Game presented the RX-series pilot droid as a product line manufactured by Industrial Automaton\u2014and as a possible character choice for players of the game. However, the 2008 compendium The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia makes no mention of IA and instead states that RX-24 was manufactured by Reubens Robotic Systems. 2009's Scavenger's Guide to Droids includes an expanded description of the RX-series and supports Scum and Villainy's attribution of the model to IA. This article assumes that both companies had some role in the history of the line's manufacture.\n\nRX-series pilot droids have also featured in non\u2013Star Tours sources. The mini-game \"Droid Programming,\" part of the massively multiplayer online game Clone Wars Adventures, features an RX unit in the level \"Delete Type.\" In that stage, the player attempts to clear a screen of color blocks, which represent the memory banks of the RX-series droid. The 2012 graphic novella The Clone Wars: The Enemy Within, written by Jeremy Barlow, features the RX-series droid Z-37.\n\nIn 2005, Lucasfilm and Disney set out to update Star Tours, setting the new version of the ride in the time period between Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Because Rex had stated that he was undertaking his first flight in the original ride, set much later in the Star Wars timeline, the Lucasfilm\u2013Disney team created a new droid pilot, AC-38, for the revamped attraction. Nevertheless, the designers placed several RX-series pilot droids along the queuing area beside crates. Most bear stickers marking them as \"defective,\" and one\u2014RX-24 himself\u2014sparks at the neck and mutters lines from the original attraction. The attraction opened to the public in 2011.\n\n",

        "content": "# RX-series pilot droid - History[]\n\nThe RX-series hit the galactic market by approximately 22 BBY. Both Reubens Robotic Systems and Industrial Automaton (IA) were companies involved in the design and manufacture of the droids. IA in particular designed the RX-series to bridge the gap between the astromech and protocol droid markets by not only programming them to pilot vehicles but also providing them with the capacity to interface directly with passengers. To that end, IA's designers chose to replace the dome-shaped head common among astromech droids with a more humanoid head to which organics could better relate. The droids retailed for between 7,300 credits and 9,855 credits, and most spaceports purchased at least a few RX-series droids to help move docked starships, pilot supply skiffs, and take chartered flights through well-traveled regions. Other customers could purchase the droids with a proper license.\n\nAround 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, Commander Griebs Kishpaugh of the Galactic Republic employed an RX-series droid designated Z-37. When a group of clone troopers under Kishpaugh's command were shot down on the planet Oznek, they traveled by foot to their target, a power plant run by the Confederacy of Independent Systems\u2014unbeknownst to them, Kishpaugh had one of the clones, codenamed \"Ghost,\" act as his personal agent to destroy the power plant and anger the inhabitants of Oznek into joining the Confederacy, with whom the Commander was secretly aligned. However, trooper Banks discovered the ruse, killed Ghost, and impersonated him in an encounter with Kishpaugh aboard the Commander's shuttle. During their encounter, Kishpaugh accidentally shot and destroyed the RX-series droid before it could launch the craft and allow its master to escape. During the same conflict, the astromech droid R2-D2 reprogrammed an RX-series pilot droid's memory banks to purge them of corruption and disorganization. A few years later, in 19 BBY, the Rodian technician Geri and his team salvaged an RX-series head and fitted it to a P2-series droid chassis. The resulting hybrid, named Candy, aided the Rodian in his shop on the planet Toprawa.\n\nThe Jawa trader Klikk knew of an RX-series droid that had a spectacular malfunction on the planet Naboo. Its owner had just stepped down from a starship boarding ramp when the RX flew away with the ship. The Naboo system observation post launched starfighters to stop the wayward automaton, but they failed to catch it before the ship jumped to hyperspace, its course consistent with hyperlanes leading to the planets Bothawui, Nal Hutta, and Rodia.\n\nRX droids were frequently used as pilots by space tourism companies. Indeed, the Star Tours travel agency used them aboard their StarSpeeder 1000 passenger transports, and later StarSpeeder 3000s, as early as 1 BBY. The company's first shipment of RX-series droids were defective, but rather than return them, Star Tours opted to have its in-house repair droids fix them back up. One droid form this shipment was RX-24.\nRX-24, nicknamed \"Rex,\" was repaired in house by 4.3 ABY, when he was tasked with conducting the maiden voyage of the Star Tours agency's new StarSpeeder 3000 passenger starship to the Forest Moon of Endor. The flight nearly proved disastrous when the droid's beginner's mistakes brought the starship into the midst of a field of icy comets, a battle between New Republic and Imperial forces, and an attack run on an Imperial battlestation. Nevertheless, Rex's deft piloting allowed him to escape the perils into which his inexperience had cast him and his passengers. Within a few months of Rex's flight, the Star Tours travel agency was driven out of business by similar accidents and poor management. Besides RX-24, two other RX-series pilot droids existed during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War: RX-23, a red-colored RX-series pilot droid, and HHG-RX, the latter of whom spent most of his time hitch-hiking at Spaceport THX1138.\n\n",

The initial robots were developed under a year and manually operated with two joysticks\u2014but they were more complex than Disney's pre-existing repertoire of animatronics as Imagineers used reinforcement learning, based on artists' animations, for the robots to move in imitated motions while navigating various terrain via real-time simulation. Each had two NVIDIA Jetson computers, plus four actuators in the head and neck and five more actuators for each leg. 3D-printed components, sensors, cameras, and LEDs completed each unit. They were unveiled by Disney Imagineers in October 2023 when three \"droids-in-training\" roamed the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge themed land in Disneyland in California. The \"play test\" showed that the robots could maneuver on uneven ground, dance without losing their balance, and \"interact\" with guests with pre-set responses.\n\nDuring development, the three BDX units were jokingly named after Disney triplets Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After the October play test, Lucasfilm Story Group member Matt Martin said that he was not yet able to reveal the names of the \"sweet babies\" because they were still in development, though he did reveal the Huey, Dewey, and Louie joke shared behind the scenes. Martin credited the talents of the Imagineers with their creation. On April 5, 2024, it was confirmed the robots would appear as a limited time feature of Galaxy's Edge during the Season of the Force event, and their in-universe name was officially revealed to be \"BDX droids.\" They were also deployed the Disney Wish cruise ship and learned to balance on deck.\n\nBDX units were later featured at the Disney Experience SXSW conference on March 8, 2025, where Imagineers explained their development of the robots via reinforcement learning and simulation. Jon Favreau then revealed that the BDX units would appear in the 2026 film The Mandalorian and Grogu. They would also visit Walt Disney World in Florida, Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Paris in 2025, with milled parts replacing 3D-printed parts to accomodate Florida's heat. During NVIDIA's AI conference ten days later, on March 18, CEO Jensen Huang announced that his company was collaborating with Google DeepMind and Disney Research to further develop Newton, an advanced physics engine that would allow AI models to be trained precisely and at high speeds. A BDX unit named \"Blue\" operating with Newton featured with Huang on stage.\n\n",

Many years later, Lucasfilm's Leland Chee first used the term \"Death Star III\" and placed its destruction a few months after Endor in a blog post. This was later confirmed as canon in the article Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours on StarWars.com.\n\nThe station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the Death Star II before it is similar to an original concept for Return of the Jedi, where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). Later sources then used the concept art as the basis for habitation spheres. Based on the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, some fans suggested them as the origin of the new Death Star. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire.\n\nIn the non-canon game Tiny Death Star, a random HoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the Death Star is simply staying there until he can afford to stay at the Death Star 3.\n\n",

The Squibs, collecting space debris for the Squib Merchandising Consortium, came to the conclusion that the material they have been scavenging could be repurposed and built into fully functional droids. With usual Squib enthusiasm, they went to work building the droids without defining its specific function. They were excited to be able to haggle about the price of the units with potential customers and ended up building droids that had a host of devices and technology bolted on to.\n\nThe main body of the C2-R4 was a scavenged R-series shell mounted on two tank-style treads. Welded onto the unit was a collection of household appliances linked together by power cells and electrical leads. The programming matrices were whatever the Squibs could get their hands on, leading to mixture of functions and ability. C2-R4 units were capable of catalytic fuel conversion, enzymatic breakdown, chemical diagnostic programming , and bacterial composting. However, they were also capable of preparing food by reprocessing trash along with their attached blender, toaster oven, and bang-corn air popper.\n\nWith no clear design philosophy, the C2-R4 series was a colossal flop. Even Gamorreans did not want a droid capable of creating meals from garbage. While a disappointment to their Squib creators, they still enjoyed the propose of haggling with their bill collectors and the remainder houses. One unit, C2-R4, ended up on the planet Tatooine and came into the possession of Wuher, the bartender at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. C2-R4 was pressed into service as a distillery, using his combination of equipment to allow Wuher to make a cocktail using Greedo's corpse.\n\n",

However, G2-9T sometimes fell asleep on the job to \"recharge batteries,\" resulting in some contraband being allowed onto the flight. He also once let a satellite receiver onboard a flight, despite it being a contraband object, because it was \"so cute.\" He also ended up destroying a passenger's camera within their luggage, having mistaken it for an alien weapon especially after it activated inside the luggage. He also expressed a desire to travel the universe, but he was outfitted with a restraining bolt, preventing him from doing so for reasons implied to be related to his job. He apparently knew about the Rebel base on Yavin 4, briefly mentioning it at one point before stopping himself.\n\nHe was later reprogrammed to act as a repair droid again. Because of his possessing remnant programming of his original owner, he also sometimes mistook a Star Tours patron for a Troig. After Star Tours was closed, the droid found work with Talon Karrde in 19 ABY. Though the droid claimed to be a fifth degree labor droid, it was actually a second-degree repair droid.\n\nG2-9T listened to the radio station FM Droid, which played Top 40 droid music. The droid was very fond of the song \"I Wanna Weld Your Hand,\" from the band Danny and the Droids.\n\n",

        "content": "# G2-9T - Behind the scenes[]\n\nHasbro released G2-9T as an exclusive Star Tours action figure. The actual model designed for the ride was built from a goose from the \"America Sings\" show, which had been removed two days prior to the show's official closure. The Goose was stripped of its 'Skin' and its head was replaced. G2-9T did, however, sometimes sing the song \"I've Been Working on the Same Droid, all the livelong day\"/\"I've Been Looking at the Same Bag, all the livelong day\", a remix of one of the goose animatronic songs, \"I've Been Working on the Railroad.\" In both versions of the Star Tours attraction, G2-9T was voiced by Disney Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald.\n\nAt one point in Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, after G2-9T somehow starts causing alarms to go off and gets a call from his supervisor, G2-9T at one point says \"Uh, everything's perfectly all right now, w-we're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. Uh, how are you?\", a paraphrase of what Han Solo said when trying to maintain cover after killing most of the security detail for the Detention Block AA-23 in A New Hope. He also says, \"Boring conversation, anyway\" shortly after cutting his supervisor off mid-sentence regarding the alarms, another phrase Solo said in the same film, after blasting the console. On another occasion, he suggests to some guests, relating to a trip to Kashyyyk for a Holochess tournament, to \"let the Wookiee win,\" referring to a line from C-3PO in A New Hope. He checked luggage with Madame Leota from The Haunted Mansion inside and reminds the guest, that \"There's always my way,\" referring to a line from that ride's \"Ghost Host.\" Sometimes, G2-9T will sing \"Star Tours! Nothing but Star Tours!\", referring to a Saturday Night Live sketch where Bill Murray portrayed a lounge singer who sang a lyrical version of the Star Wars main theme.\n\nHe temporarily disappeared from the Disneyland Paris version of Star Tours on March 18, 2013, for repair work.\n\n",
