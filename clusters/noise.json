It was part of material reprinted from the 2000 reference book Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Episode I, which was written by Kristin Lund, illustrated by Richard Chasemore and Hans Jenssen, and marked the first mention of the device in the Star Wars Legends continuity. The book's illustration of Watto's junkshop including the alta-wave calibration device, then appeared as an area where players would search out specific items in the 2012 non-canon video game Star Wars Galactic Spy.\n\n",

When the droid spotted a person or creature, a beam of light would appear and lock on to the target. When close enough, the beam would turn red, indicating the person or creature is in imminent danger of being blown up. By 9 BBY, the origins of the roller mine were shrouded in mystery. Many assumed the droid was made for blasting through rock and debris, and some claim it was created by one of the earliest priorite prospectors. At one point, the Gotarite prospector Soont Madas attempted to use roller mines to access a Jedi Meditation Chamber on Koboh. In doing so, he reprogrammed the mines such that they became hostile to any passersby.\n\n",

When the station was contacted by clone troopers Clone Captain Rex and Clone Commander Cody, Sparky posed as a clone by wearing a helmet and modulating its voice in an unsuccessful attempt to make them leave.

Its armament consisted of two front-mounted laser cannons and a rotatable SW-4 ion cannon controlled from the gunner's turret. The ship had extendable legs for landing on the ground. 23.4 meters in length, the bomber could carry three crew members: a pilot in its cockpit, a gunner in the central bubble turret, and an astromech droid in the onboard socket, situated to the rear of the gunner's turret. Accessible by a three-paned hatch, the cockpit contained controls to activate the starfighter's engines and to open the gunner's turret. The Y-wing had a largely white paint job, with blue stripes on its central body and grey markings down the length of the engines, which were also marked with the Republic crest in black.\n\n",

After Tano had freed Clone Commander Rex from his inhibitor chip, the two attempted to escape the Tribunal, which had fallen into a collision course with a moon after Darth Maul, a former prisoner on the starship, destroyed its hyperdrive. Maul stole the shuttle Tano and Rex had intended to take, and the two found the starfighter in the repair bay at the last minute as enemy clones fired on them, effecting a narrow and dangerous escape.\n\nAfter the Republic was reformed into the Galactic Empire, Rex continued to utilize the Y-wing as he sought to fight back against the new regime. When he met the former clone commandos of the Bad Batch on the junk planet Bracca so that they could use the medical facilities of a wrecked Star Destroyer to remove the Batch's inhibitor chips, Rex landed the Y-wing inside the remains of another vessel. When the Bad Batch arrived, they landed their transport, the Marauder, beside the Y-wing, disembarking to follow Rex to their destination.\n\n",

In its intended role, the T-7 made short work of many armored vehicles, mechanized infantry, airspeeders, and even starships - its intense ionization being particularly deadly to aircraft, as it could shut down critical components and send them into a death spiral - the T-7 was capable of chewing through nearly anything its path. The T-7 was, however, a slow firing weapon and required a lengthy pause between shots to recharge and cool down. Further, the T-7 was resolutely unmodifiable, and could not benefit from attachments or modifications to grant faster firing speeds, improvements to its range, or grant multiple shots.\n\nDespite its deadly fire capability, the T-7 gained its notorious reputation from its use on sentient beings; a single shot from a T-7 produced an explosive blast that could atomize entire groups of lifeforms - when used on an organic being, the victim was disintegrated on the molecular level atom by atom, resulting in a slow, painful, and excruciatingly grotesque death.\n\n",

However, Kalani, who was stationed on Agamar aboard a Separatist supply ship at the time with a battle droid garrison, assumed the shutdown command was nothing more than a Republic trick so he ignored it and did not relay to the droids under his command.\n\nYears later, Captain Rex, Lasat Garazeb Orrelios, Jedi Kanan Jarrus, and his Padawan Ezra Bridger arrived on Agamar, looking to find weapons and explosives for the rebellion. Kalani had his forces captured them and brought them to him so that he could play a little \"war game,\" saying that he could finally \"end\" the Clone Wars his way. Kalani held Zeb hostage while Rex, Kanan, and Ezra fought through his troops. After defeating waves of battle droids and making their way to the command center, Rex, Kanan, and Ezra ordered Kalani to surrender. Kalani refused, but Ezra convinced him that neither the Republic nor the Separatists won the war and the Republic became the Empire. When the Empire arrived on Agamar, Kalani agreed to help the rebels escape. While the droids and Zeb attacked the stormtroopers and AT-DP's, Kalani had five droids fired at Ezra and Kanan, who redirected their shots at proton bombs underneath the AT-AT's, destroying one of them in the process. The droids and the rebels made their escape in three Sheathipede-class transport shuttles, one being destroyed in the process. Kalani bid farewell to the rebels but refused to join them, believing that they had less than a 1% chance of successfully overthrowing the Empire.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Behind the scenes[]\n\nGregor first appeared in \"Missing in Action,\" an episode of the fifth season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. A preview clip featuring Gregor was later shown at Celebration VI. He is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. A trailer for the show's fifth season includes Aurebesh on Gregor's profile notes indicating that he went missing in action during the Battle of Sarrish.\n\nDuring the episode, a hologram showing Gregor's military records was displayed in Aurebesh after R2-D2 scanned his identifying code. As well as displaying Gregor's status as MIA during the Battle of Sarrish, it displayed \"SGT 1st Class,\" \"212 Attack Battalion,\" and \"Foxtrot Group,\" as well as Gregor's height and weight. The designation of SGT 1st Class contradicts Colonel Gascon stating that Gregor was a captain, despite the fact that Gascon was going off of the hologram.\n\nThe markings on Gregor's helmet were inspired by the hash-marks that Boston Bruins goaltender Gerry Cheevers stenciled on his mask to denote the stitches he would get had he not been wearing protective gear.\n\nBaker later reprised his role as Gregor in the second season of the Disney XD animated television series Star Wars Rebels; appearing in the episodes \"The Lost Commanders\" and \"Relics of the Old Republic,\" which premiered on October 8, 2015 at the 2015 New York Comic Con. He was erroneously referred to as a Clone Commander in the former episode. Three years later, Baker reprised his role as Gregor once more in the final Rebels episodes \"A Fool's Hope\" and \"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell,\" which premiered on March 5, 2018 on Disney XD.\n\nDuring development of the Star Wars Adventures: The Clone Wars \u2013 Battle Tales comic book series, Michael Moreci wanted to have Gregor make an appearance, but he was not allowed to do so.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Mission to Geonosis[]\n\nIn 2 BBY, Saw led a mission to investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species of the planet Geonosis. His Partisan group had become one of the many cells that would form the Rebel Alliance. Saw undertook the Geonosian mission on behalf of Rebel Command and Senator Bail Organa, an ally of the growing rebellion in the Imperial Senate. His team lost contact with Rebel Command after picking up an energy reading, which turned out to be an operational deflector shield generator.\n\nWhile exploring an underground labyrinth, Saw and his team were ambushed by Klik-Klak, the sole Geonosian to have survived the Sterilization of Geonosis. Klik-Klak's battle droids killed Saw's team but Saw managed to survive long enough for members of the Spectres rebel cell and Rex to rescue him. Saw saved the Spectres and Rex from a group of B1 battle droids and a droideka. Believing that the \"bug\" Klik-Klak was key to finding out why the Empire had exterminated the population of Geonosis, Saw convinced Rex and the Spectres to help him capture Klik-Klak.\n\nWhile exploring the central air shaft, Saw and his team discovered Klik-Klak hiding on the other side. While the Spectres Ezra Bridger and Chopper pursued the Geonosian, Saw waited with Kanan and Rex when the Spectres' leader Hera Syndulla contacted Kanan. When Hera told them to leave, Saw convinced the Spectres to delay their stay so that they could complete his original mission to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian species. Using the Force, Kanan used a stone bridge to ferry Saw and Rex safely across to the other side of the air shaft.\n\nOnce they had crossed, Saw and his rebel companions managed to corner Klik-Klak. Saw also shot out Klik Klak's remote controller with his blaster; deactivating several droidekas which were attacking the Spectres Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios above. Saw then interrogated Klik-Klak and demanded to know what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Unable to speak Galactic Basic Standard, Klik-Klak drew in the sand repeatedly. Ezra managed to befriend Klik-Klak. After Chopper picked up an energy reading, Saw forced Klik-Klak to lead them to the source.\n\nSaw and his companions soon discovered the energy reading came from Klik-Klak's nest, which served as his workshop and contained a transmitter. Still bitter about the loss of his sister Steela at the hands of the Separatists, Saw aggressively questioned Klik-Klak and rummaged through his place. Saw's aggressive methods yielded no results while Ezra's gentler methods convinced Klik-Klak to reveal that he was the custodian of the last known Geonosian queen egg. Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak off-world but Ezra objected on the grounds that Klik-Klak and the egg were among the last of their species and belonged on Geonosis. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise whereby the rebels could question Klik-Klak at Chopper Base and then return him to Geonosis.\n\nSaw, his rebel allies and their prisoner Klik-Klak rendezvoused with the Spectres' ship Ghost in the central air shaft. Once aboard, Saw exchanged pleasantries with Hera and the rest of her crew. While Kanan and Hera were preoccupied, Saw reneged on his earlier agreement and tried to take Klik-Klak off-world on the shuttle Phantom II. To force Klik-Klak's cooperation, Saw shocked him with an electro-shock device. This sparked an argument with the Spectres and Rex, who all objected to Saw's harsh methods. After fighting off Ezra and Rex, Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg. In response, Ezra and Rex urged him not to become like the Empire he was fighting against.\n\nSaw's argument with the Spectres was interrupted by the arrival of Captain Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser, which blocked the air shaft and deployed a squad of Jumptroopers to board the Ghost. Saw joined the rebels in repelling the Imperial boarders as the ship descended into the depths of Geonosis. Once at the bottom, Saw and his rebel comrades discovered several poison canisters which provided compelling evidence that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. Regretting his past behavior towards Klik-Klak, Saw argued that the Geonosians deserved the same right to rebuild as other peoples and released Klik-Klak and the Geonosian egg.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Assassination of Moff Panaka[]\n\nIn 3 BBY, Gerrera, shaven his head bald again, arranged for a bomb to detonate at the residence of Moff Quarsh Panaka. The bomb achieved its objective of killing the Moff who was supposedly one of the Emperor's most loyal servants. The timing of the bomb narrowly missed killing Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan and Naboo's queen Daln\u00e9, who had only just bid farewell to the Moff in his chalet moments before the explosion after discussing improving the working conditions of the miners on Onoam. Although no real proof was ever given that Saw ordered the Moff's death, Leia's mother Breha Organa correctly surmised that as leader of the Partisans, he must have been involved in some way and told Leia that she and her husband would be telling Saw how close he had come to murdering their daughter.\n\nThe assassination of Panaka greatly upset the rest of the rebels, who became increasingly frustrated at trying to keep the Partisans in line, as Panaka was the highest ranking member of the Emperor's inner circle that they had any hope of contacting some day and possibly even working with. With Saw's actions this was no longer a possibility. Princess Leia also didn't approve of Panaka's assassination as she viewed him as a good man though she initially allowed the Partisan she saw on Onoam to escape Imperial arrest as she feared that her parents may have been involved in the assassination, an accusation that greatly angered and offended Bail Organa.\n\nUnbeknownst to Gerrera, his actions had indirectly saved Leia and her adoptive family as during Panaka's meeting with her and Danl\u00e9, Leia was wearing the jubilation dress that was once worn by her biological mother Padm\u00e9 Amidala which caused Panaka a great shock, and he managed to deduce Leia's heritage, unknown to even the princess at the time, and had planned on telling Palpatine however his death prevented this.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Behind the scenes[]\n\nThe character of Saw Gerrera was voiced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: The Bad Batch by Andrew Kishino. Saw Gerrera was played by Forest Whitaker in the 2016 Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, who returned to voice the character in Star Wars Rebels and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. He was originally conceived by Star Wars creator George Lucas for the unproduced live-action television series Star Wars: Underworld.\n\nAccordingly, the character's name is a \"mnemonic riff\" on real-life Argentinian revolutionary and associate of Castro - Che Guevara as revealed in The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Lucasfilm Story Group's Kiri Hart was the one who suggested that the character be used in Rogue One. Another inspiration for Gerrera's character, according to Phil Szostak, was Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz from Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now. According to writer Gary Whitta, Forest Whitaker was the only actor they considered to play Gerrera in Rogue One.\n\nWhitaker reprised his role as Gerrera in the episodes \"Narkina 5\" and \"Daughter of Ferrix\" in the Andor television series. Executive producer and writer Tony Gilroy wanted Gerrera and the other legacy characters to not provide fan service. The night before a rehearsal for Gerrera and Luthen Rael's argument in \"Narkina 5,\" Whitaker asked director Toby Haynes questions about backstory and kyber crystals. During the rehearsal, Whitaker and Rael's actor, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, read the scene for the first time and went at each other. According to Haynes, when the scene was filmed for real, Whitaker and Skarsg\u00e5rd almost deconstructed what they did in a natural and spontaneous way. They then had to completely reconstruct the scene, and it was hard to get to the same pitch. Haynes wanted to end Gerrera's rant with a very direct, face-on shot of Whitaker to build the intensity and bring the audience into the argument. To accomplish this, Haynes had Whitaker do his speech several times, telling him to \"go crazy with it.\"\n\n",

Skywalker forced his way through the Gamorrean guards posted at the door before interrogating the Ithorian bartender, using a Force choke when the Ithorian tried to extort him. The pair left as soon as they learned that the fugitives had recently purchased a ship and left.\n\nThe saloon's indoor and outdoor areas were packed with dozens of individuals of a variety of alien species.

While Yalli sipped an iced beverage, the smugglers lamented the growing shortage of work. As they argued about the band's music, with Obitt expressing distaste for the song they were playing, two other patrons in the cantina drew knives and began a fight. When Imperial stormtroopers entered the cantina and detained the pair, the rest of the customers in the Wanton Wellspring booed and cursed at the troopers. Shortly after the incident, Obitt noticed his contact Matese, a former Republic Intelligence direct action operative who now served the Empire, enter the Wellspring and sit at a corner table far away from the bar. Obitt made his way over, with Matese informally greeting him by saying that he hated the song that was playing. After a conversation, Matese offered Obitt work in smuggling arms. Obitt accepted the job and worked with Yalli, Ribert, and the other human to deliver Separatist weapons to the planet Samovar.\n\nAfter the job, which had resulted in Obitt and the others making more money than they had made during the entire war, Matese insisted Obitt return to Jibuto to meet with him at the Wanton Wellspring. As he entered the establishment, the Gamorrean bouncers ushered him inside despite the line to get in, and as Obitt made his way towards the corner table that Matese had reserved, he noticed many other smugglers inside staring at him. Although Matese was not present, Obitt say and waited for them. The smuggler Molo approached Obitt and began questioning Obitt about the nature of his job on Samovar. Obitt learned that the weapons drop had been an Imperial operation designed to \"discover\" the weapons on the planet and use the event as a means to strip the planet of its Legacy world status, meaning the Empire could begin mining operations there. Molo accused Obitt of being an Imperial sympathizer for working with an undercover Imperial like Matese, but when Matese entered Molo left and returned to his own table. Matese feigned innocence on the nature of the job on Samovar and gave Obitt another weapons delivery job, which would involve travel to the planet Wadi Raffa.\n\nshortly before they carried out a smuggling operation. Later, following his stand against the Galactic Empire, Obitt returned to the Wanton Wellspring and received a hero's welcome at the Wellspring.\n\n",

        "content": "# Porg - History[]\n\nPorgs evolved from seabirds on Ahch-To. Considered quite tasty by some species, they were sometimes hunted by the resident Lanai as well as visitors to Ahch-To. At the time of the First Order-Resistance War, when Jedi Master Luke Skywalker threw his lightsaber off a cliff, two porgs investigated the weapon. The birds nearly activated the weapon, before they were scared off by Rey. Shortly afterwards, another porg watched in curiosity from its nest as the Jedi Master spearfished from an island cliff. Rey found the porgs to be helpful to her Jedi training after she used the Force to catch one in midair in order to retrieve the lightsaber it had snatched. Finding that the porg's flock was visibly fascinated by her power, Rey promised them all \"a turn.\" While staying on Ahch-To, the Wookiee Chewbacca roasted two porgs for supper. A few of the birds stared at him before he could take a bite, but Chewbacca scared them off. When Chewbacca landed on Ahch-To, he considered porgs as a tasty treat, but found it hard to kill the winged creatures when the pack turned their sad eyes on him.\n\nUnable to acquire a patch of blue moss for their young twins, a couple of porgs snatched wiring of the same color from the Millennium Falcon, hindering repairs that were being performed by Chewbacca and R2-D2. Following the porgs to their nest, Chewbacca tried to barter the blue wiring for a blanket but was declined. Soon realizing the plight of the porgs, Chewbacca was convinced by R2 to brave strong winds in order to harvest the moss from the high tree. Grateful for his assistance, the parents returned the wiring to Chewbacca, marking his first amicable relationship with porgs.\n\nLater, at least four porgs found their way aboard the Millennium Falcon and made a nest. One of them accompanied Chewbacca during the Battle of Crait. Despite having an initial antagonism with the porgs, Chewbacca grew to like them and became their friend. These stowaways eventually managed to spread their species far from the borders of their home planet.\n\nBoarding the Millennium Falcon, General Leia Organa observed a number of the creatures roosting aboard the vessel, prompting her to ask Chewbacca when the ship had become a birdcage.\n\nAmong the porgs which resided on the Millennium Falcon were the Porg Stowaway, Puffy, and Snappy.\n\nIn 34 ABY, porgs were imported to the planet Batuu and sold as pets in the Creature Stall at Black Spire Outpost. According to author and explorer Eloc Throno, porgs were brought to Batuu when a light freighter arrived in the spacesport. Oga's Cantina served a deep orange-colored fruity beverage from Ahch-To called a Cliff Dweller in mugs carved to look like porgs.\n\nIn 35 ABY, a pair of porgs watched as Rey attempted to destroy Kylo Ren's TIE whisper and her lightsaber on Ahch-To.\n\n",

        "content": "# Club Lao Che - History[]\n\nAround 18 BBY, Omega and Phee Genoa met up with the criminal Lanse Crowder and his associates at the cantina to purchase a tree-shaped artifact. When Crowder insisted that they pay first, Genoa countered by insisting on checking that it was not a \"knock-off.\" When Crowder noticed Omega and asked if she works alone, Genoa explained that she was teaching Omega the \"art of negotiation.\" Crowder offered drinks but Genoa refused, dismissing it as poison. Genoa admitted that he was impressed but secretly released a kouhun under the table.\n\nMeanwhile, Omega's fellow Clone Force 99 member Hunter sensed movement. Omega responded that Genoa was not a pirate but a liberator of ancient wonders. Genoa agreed while Hunter played a game of sabacc with a Bith, and proceeded to grab the Bith's hands before they could reach for a card. Before the kouhun could pierce Genoa's neck with its stinger, however, Hunter impaled the creature against the wall with his knife. Crowder's helmeted henchmen raised their blasters at Hunter. Crowder believed that he has the upper hand but Genoa revealed that Hunter was not her sole \"muscle.\"\n\nAt that, Wrecker, another member of Clone Force 99, made his presence known and took out several of Crowder's henchmen, triggering a gunfight. Omega jointed the gunfight and fired her energy bow at Crowder and his men, before grabbing the artifact and shooting down the hanging ceiling lamp over Chowder. Hunter requested pick-up from fellow team member Tech, who readied the Marauder away from the club. Genoa and the clones made a getaway by using smoke bombs to disorientate Crowder and his men. They escaped the cantina and fled aboard the parked Marauder.\n\n",

He paid ten credits for the pair's drinks, before parting with another hundred credits for information from the bartender on how to meet Nuat. Just after he paid the credits, Nuat walked in and was flanked by a pack of guards. In his custody was the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari, whom he planned to sell to the Empire. Rath Velus recognized Emari from an encounter during the Battle of Endor and offered to buy her from the crime lord while posing as an Imperial. After Nuat told Rath Velus that he had not informed the Empire that he had Emari in his possession, he ordered his guards to kill the ex-Imperial. During the ensuing chaos, Dokura was killed and Rath Velus was knocked unconscious by the bartender and taken by Nuat's thugs where he was imprisoned in one of the dungeon's cages, along with Emari.\n\nThe same night, Temmin Wexley had been brought to Nuat's office under the cantina after it had been identified he had stolen a weapon from the crime lord. After Wexley pleaded with Nuat to be freed, the youngster was taken by Nuat's Herglic enforcer Gor-kooda to the facilities cistern where Nuat intended to cut out the boy\u2019s tongue.\n\nAfter Emari escaped her cage, she freed Rath Velus and the pair looked to leave the compound. However, Rath Velus decided to save Wexley, believing he could be useful for repairs. They overpowered Gor-kooda, who had Wexley by the wrists, and made their way to the bar area, where they were quickly spotted by an Ithorian guard. A short blaster fight ensued before the trio were able to escape through the damaged side door and away from the cantina.\n\n",

By circa 396 BBY, during his days as a student at Reena University, Axel Greylark let the laboratory's mynocks loose as a prank. Like other pranks carried out by the young man, no investigation could link him and the action, although Dean of Student Life Ry Harket knew for certain Greylark was to blame, even without evidence.\n\nAt one point during the Galactic Civil War, Commander Tylux of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Bellicose led his ship on a chase to capture a spy of the Alliance to Restore the Republic in order to not fail the Sith Lord Darth Vader, eventually commanding the Bellicose to pursue the Rebel ship into an Exogorth that lived in an asteroid field. The Star Destroyer rammed through the space creature, with a number of mynocks that lived inside it taking the opportunity to latch on and feast off the Bellicose. Damage caused by the mynocks and asteroids cost the destroyer its tractor beam, shielding, and brought damage to the ship's hull. Thus, one of Tylux's Imperial officers suspected the rebel had led them into a trap, although the spy had actually been surpirsed by the Star Destroyer's action. The mynocks continued their feast as five Rebel starships arrived to reinforce the spy, firing upon the Bellicose as the crew abandoned the destroyer.\n\nIn 3 ABY, a short time after the Battle of Hoth, the crew of the Millennium Falcon attempted to hide from Vader's personal starfleet in the Hoth asteroid belt, landing in what they assumed to be a cave. In reality, they landed in the gullet of an Exogorth named Sy-O. Unlike other Exogorths, Sy-O loved mynocks and welcomed them into their internal ecosystem. After several mynocks attacked and Captain Han Solo realized what they were standing in, the Falcon and its crew escaped Sy-O.\n\n",

The character's costume was made up of items from the costumes of several other Mos Eisley Cantina patrons, including Trinto Duaba's robe, M'iiyoom Onith's shirt, and a mask and claws used by fellow Gotals Feltipern Trevagg and Cobb Sonbepol. The mask was designed by conceptual artist Ron Cobb and created by makeup artist Laine Liska.\n\nCostume designer Rick Baker had originally created the claws as props for the 1974 horror film It's Alive. Liska modified the claws with fur for Star Wars. The cantina character Myo also used a separate pair of the same claw props but without the fur.\n\nThe Hennet Kayn character name was first created at the \"Behind the Scenes of the Cantina\" panel at Star Wars Celebration Chicago in 2019.\nAfter panel host Tom Spina discovered production images of Kayn, he and Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee named the character based on panel attendee Kenneth Haynie, who won the honor during the panel.\n\n",

Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, the Gotal was in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley when the smuggler Han Solo attempted to leave the establishment, only to be forced back into his seat by the bounty hunter Greedo.\n\nAs Solo and Greedo discussed the bounty on the smuggler's head, Kayn walked from the direction of the cantina's main bar into a booth, where the Abyssin Myo and the Talz Muftak were seated. Solo and Greedo then exchanged blasterfire, with Solo killing the bounty hunter, which briefly drew the attention of many patrons in the cantina.\n\n",

        "content": "# Oga Garra - Biography[]\n\nAbout four months following the Battle of Crait, Oga caught her Wookiee lover, Dhoran, having an affair with one of Oga's waitresses, the Rodian, Meeba. Oga fatally shot Dhoran and fired Meeba. As she picked over her late lover's corpse, Oga lamented her habit of falling for \"the big, hairy, bad boys.\"\n\nAfter Vi Moradi began snooping around Black Spire Outpost, Oga had one of her goons, the Karkarodon, Rusko, bring Moradi to her in her hidden cantina office. Moradi confirmed that Oga's suspicions were correct and that she was with the Resistance, and explained her intent to set up a local base. Oga had no love for Moradi's Resistance; regardless, she offered some of Moradi's supplies back to her in exchange for a specific Batuu artifact. Dok-Ondar had been on the search for the artifact to no avail, and Oga, who had a buyer for the artifact, was eager to acquire it directly, avoiding paying Dok-Ondar a cut of the profits. She had previously dispatched multiple people to find the artifact, but they had fallen prey to the various traps left in the Black Spire Ruins by the Ancients. Moradi negotiated permission to use the ruins as a Resistance base, explaining that Resistance troops and pilots around Black Spire Outpost would be good for business and that when they eventually left, the ruins would be left clean and trap-free. Oga agreed to these terms and mockingly welcomed her to Black Spire Outpost.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath of the First Order arrived in Black Spire Outpost, demanding to see Oga, Oga consented to receive him in her hidden office. When Kath offered Oga the favor of the First Order in exchange for giving up Vi Moradi, who he knew as Starling, Oga reiterated what she had told Moradi: Oga cared only about Black Spire Outpost and her own interests. She then offered the First Order her own favor, and information on Starling, in exchange for the mysterious artifact.\n\nIt was Moradi who returned with the artifact, a necklace crafted of ethereal blue gems. Oga was incensed to learn that Moradi had stopped by Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, although Moradi was able to pacify the Blutopian. Oga accepted the necklace and confirmed to Moradi that Kath was searching for her specifically. Moradi hinted that Oga may have sold her out, which Oga refuted. She assured the spy that her lost cargo was to be returned to her, and dismissed her.\n\nOga was also involved in a spat with Zade Kalliday and his partner Valoss. They owed Oga credits, including years worth of docking fees. She sent the pair on a job retrieving a load of Moogyyrko sap from the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk to be refined into liquor later. In exchange, Oga would drop the substantial debt. Unfortunately, Kalliway lost both the cargo and his partner after their ship was boarded by the First Order. Returning to Black Spire Outpost empty-handed, a furious Oga impounded his ship..\n\nAs conflict between Moradi's burgeoning Resistance cell and Kath's forces escalated, Oga reached out to local scrap merchant Savi, of Savi & Son Salvage, forbidding him from interfering with either of them.\n\nShortly after Kath\u2019s defeat, Moradi would return to Oga's Cantina, and Oga invited her into her office. Off the record, Oga complimented Moradi. She understood that the First Order\u2019s presence in Black Spire Outpost was bad for the general populace and recognized Moradi's efforts in protecting them from the tyrants. Regardless, Oga stressed that she was still no friend to the Resistance, claiming that if the First Order returned offering money, friendship and respect, she would welcome them with open arms. As their talk wound down, Oga returned to Moradi the long-range comm that had been lost in Moradi's crash. Moradi questioned the reason for the gift, and Oga confirmed that she wanted Moradi to owe her, and to respect her power in Black Spire..",

The Resurgent-class Star Destroyer the Finalizer would be crippled in battle over the planet and escape pods full of Resistance infiltrators would rain down on the outpost.

        "content": "# Old Jho's Pit Stop - Description[]\n\nOne of the few places where Lothal's old frontier spirit survived, Old Jho's Pit Stop was a remote repair facility and docking bay located in the heart of a small outpost informally known as \"Jhothal,\" both of which were named after the facility's owner, an Ithorian named Jho. Located hours from Capital City, the Pit Stop's main attraction was a quaint cantina where Old Jho served drinks, popular with locals and travelers alike, beneath which was a storeroom. A holoprojector was mounted on the wall behind the bar. Jho kept his antiquated hauler beneath a tarp behind the Pit Stop. Although a very friendly bar owner, the Ithorian kept a hunting blaster under the counter in case of troublemakers.\n\nMany of Jho's furnishing were made from repurposed goods, such as lamps built from pit droids and an overhead fan made out of a gunship engine, as well as repurposed moisture vaporator tanks. Scavenged relics from the Clone Wars were scattered around the bar to remind patrons of the galaxy's wartime history, including a Phase I clone trooper helmet on a shelf behind the bar and what appeared to be the nose of a Low Altitude Assault Transport known as the Crumb Bomber, which Jho claimed was authentic, was mounted above its hangar bay entrance. The repair facility's signage, written in a combination of Outer Rim Basic and Aurebesh, was featured on a pair of LAAT/i wings attached on either side of the gunship's nose.\n\nThe Pit Stop was said to be the only place on Lothal where one could enjoy refreshments while their vehicle's power converters were being changed. Unlike some, Jho did not discriminate, and as long as one had credits to spare, he would serve whatever a customer wanted, which included humans, humanoids, and even droids, whether it was bantha milk or lubricator fluid. However, Old Jho's Pit Stop was not particularly Empire-friendly, ignoring an Imperial mandate that the HoloNet News be played at all times. Despite this, TIE fighter pilots and other Imperials could still be found there. The Pit stop offered a discreet meeting place to smugglers, gamblers, and the occasional Imperial.\n\nJho served simple meals and drinks such as spicebrew, ice-cold fizzy, and ice water, as well as desserts such as space waffles with muja sauce, minced Loth-rat pie, jogan fruitcake, blue milk custard, and spiced nysillin tea. After Jho was executed for aiding the Rebellion in 1 BBY, the bar was taken over by Baron Valen Rudor, who turned it into a haunt popular with Imperial personnel.\n\n",

The vessel possessed a pair of docking rings, along the port and starboard sides of its spine, in addition to two of both sides of its bow, which were designated for Launch Pod Docks. The docks onboard, equipped with airlocks, would accept the passengers of the multiple Launch Pods from a planet-bound terminal, as they rendezvous with the Star Cruiser. Another set of docks, referred to as Transport Docks, were designated for transport shuttles docking with the starship. During 34 ABY, transport shuttles belonging to the Batuu Transport Company would service the passengers aboard the Halcyon, by taking individuals to the Batuu hub of Black Spire Outpost during denoted excursion periods.\n\n",

Initially, one scene was to have featured Beru Lars, played by Shelagh Fraser, pouring blue milk into a jug in her kitchen. That footage, however, was left on the cutting room floor. Mark Hamill stated the blue milk was \"life-long milk\" with \"additives \u2013 they put blue food coloring in it \u2013 and it was really ghastly. Oily and sweet and euch! Triggered your gag reflex. But I said, 'Look \u2013 if they gave me blue milk, you bet I'm going to drink it on camera, because what other chance am I going to get?' So there's an indication that I'm an underrated actor \u2013 I gulped it and acted like I liked it without vomiting.\"\n\nThe anthology novel From a Certain Point of View, celebrating the 40th anniversary of A New Hope, was first teased on social media on April 6, 2017, using the hashtag #OperationBlueMilk. The real-world Milk Stand found at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge serves \"blue milk,\" which is actually a frozen plant-based blend of coconut and rice milks that the menu describes as having \"alluring fruity characteristics.\" The Disney's Hollywood Studios location additionally serves an alcoholic Blue Milk Cooler. The real-world Oga's Cantina at both parks serves Blue Bantha, a non-alcoholic cocktail with a cookie.\n\nIn the real world, naturally occurring blue items are rarely edible. Writer Melissa T. Miller dedicated the Star Wars Insider article \"Got Blue Milk?\" to analyzing blue Star Wars items, such as blue milk, and their lack of real world counterparts. In the piece, Miller theorized that blue milk either got its color from its refining process or, drawing on how real world milk can change in hue based on the producer's diet, something ate by Banthas that affected the coloration. Miller specifically pondered if fields of blue wildflowers existed amongst the Tatooine sands. The 2020 non-canon video game expansion The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey to Batuu includes blue milk as a drink sold to the player's Sims at the Milk Stand vendor in the Black Spire Outpost neighborhood. In the home neighborhood, it can be purchased as a quick meal from refrigerators.\n\n",

Following a raid on an Imperial outpost that had been relaying messages to the Imperial-controlled planet Pandem Nai, Tensent joined the pilots of Hail Squadron at the Krayt Hut until past midnight and into the morning, where they compared notes on Y-wing repair. As the ragtag crew that made up the newly assembled Alphabet Squadron, namely Tensent, Lark, Yrica Quell, Kairos, and Chass na Chadic, eventually began to bond, they also began to hang out at the Krayt Hut.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Pandem Nai, which was a resounding New Republic win, a victory party was held aboard the Lodestar, with Ranjiy's Krayt Hut playing host to a group of over thirty pilots, mechanics, and specforce troops. Although some of the partygoers expected General Hera Syndulla, the Lodestar's commander, to shut the party down, a captain arrived at the Krayt Hut to deliver the news that she would be allowing the party. Syndulla eventually joined the party herself, with Tensent buying her a drink. As the party at the Krayt Hut wore on, Kairos and Chadic played sabacc and Chadic heard her music playing, learning that Lark had taken her datachips of deva pop music to play. Chadic invited Lark to stay and participate in the celebrations at the Krayt Hut, which he did.\n\nIn 5 ABY, New Republic forces, including the Lodestar, were attacked by the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, the same outfit who had failed to stop the New Republic at Pandem Nai. The Lodestar had been positioned above the planet Troithe but was attacked by squadrons of Imperial fighters, resulting in the ship being completely destroyed.\n\n",

Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Leids was a patron of Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on the planet Tatooine. He was standing at the cantina's bar when Luke Skywalker entered with C-3PO and R2-D2, a pair of droids, turning around when the bartender Wuher informed them of the establishment's no droid policy.\n\nLeids had brown skin and a pair of large, black eyes, and, because his species evolved to breathe methane, not oxygen, he wore a breath mask and carried his own supply of the gas while on Tatooine.\n\nMany years later, Leids was present on Oba Diah, where he told Karr Nuq Sin about Skywalker and Kenobi's appearance at the cantina, though Leids did not remember what planet it had occurred on, just that it had two suns.\n\n",

Its design was based on a Ralph McQuarrie sketch that depicted the interior of Jabba's Palace.\n\nThe cantina was first unveiled during the D23 Expo for 2017 via a scale model of the Galaxy's Edge park area. The exterior of the cantina also appeared very briefly in a scene added to the Star Tours: The Adventures Continue attraction on November 17, 2017. Further details were revealed during the Galactic Nights event on December 16 of the same year via two trading cards that gave some details of the locations and expected elements of the park. The first, the cover of the card, revealed that RX-24 from the original Star Tours was re-purposed as a DJ, with the new name \"R3X,\" and the second, as part of the map portion of the card, revealed that it acted as the local watering hole, was located near Smuggler's Alley, and that one of its beverages was Blurrgfire. It included two Aurebesh statements on its borders, stating, \"BLACK WAS THE SPIRE THAT\" and \"CALLED ME TO STAY.\"\n\nAccording to the Walt Disney World News Today fan site, the cantina is the place where one can purchase drinks, as well as interact with various criminals, bounty hunters, and smugglers, and see live music performed. A piece of concept art released earlier by Disney resembled the card's image of the cantina. A name and more details were revealed on August 30, 2018 on the Disney Parks Blog.\n\n",

After the monks disappeared, the building became a business.\n\nBy 3 ABY, the Domak Refectory began specializing in hot teas, soups and stew such as Kyumo stew. It had a Fathier racing betting station installed which projected races from Canto Bight. A Melitto member of the Ashiga Clan named Mehdo had a high\u2013roller Kessel Sabacc parlor in a backroom of the refectory.\n\nIn 3 ABY, Kay Vess visited the Domak Refectory when looking for the Chadra-Fan explosives expert, Ank Parako who was a regular at the cantina. A bartender at the cantina informed Vess that Parako had been forced to work at the Ashiga weapons factory on Kijimi after a job went south. After improving her relationship with the Ashiga Clan, Vess was contacted by Krisk Ashiga, daughter of the clan's queen, to meet at the Refectory. Once there Vess was introduced to Qi'ra, the leader of the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Vess learned that Krisk was planning a coup on queen Ashiga with the support of Crimson Dawn and that the group wanted Vess to free Parako from the weapons factory.\n\nDuring the same year, a human mercenary named Rooster Trace spent her time at the reflectory after the Galactic Empire destroyed here ship and confiscated her weapons. Kranash, a Trandoshan contract broker, operated out of the entrance of the cantina. A copy of episode 44 of the Glarnok & Yabassi holodrama and a copy of Jet Kordo's journal entry on bounty hunters had been left in the cantina. EE'zok's keycard to Crimson Dawn's vault on the planet had also been left on a loft at the reflectory.\n\nKay Vess took several jobs from individuals at the cantina, including from a Crimson Dawn enforcer and an arms dealer. A datapad left at the cantina gave Vess the code to unlock a gate and retrieve a stash of goods left by an individual named Venti. Vess also approached Rooster Trace about getting training with heavy weapons, however Trace refused. During the conversation, Trace disclosed her trouble with the Empire. After Vess was able to track down Trace's confiscated weapons to Tatooine, Trace decided to leave the cantina and meet Vess.\n\n",

A bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian arrived to collect a bounty on the Mythrol, and, despite the attempted intervention of the bartender, a fight ensued between the Mandalorian and the three companions threatening the Mythrol.

During that time, host Palob Godalhi of the Black Spire Outpost radio station BSO 401.72 sometimes told listeners they should visit the cantina and order the beverage.\n\nIn 34 ABY, after the Battle of Takodana, Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs published his cookbook The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook and included a recipe for the beverage, which he enjoyed drinking for its bold flavor and its energizing effects. He compared its ability to provide energy with a hypothetical digestible version of coaxium, a form of hypermatter used as fuel for hyperdrives.

The tavern's roof eventually developed a hole, which the owner did not repair due to the constant state of strife on the world. By that time, many Strop's End locals enjoyed gathering in the tavern to enjoy alcoholic vinbeer or a bowl of scrambled grubbub.\n\nBetween around 234 BBY and 232 BBY, the Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm and his Padawan, Bell Zettifar, visited the tavern after searching for a communal spot in Strop's End to meet the local community during their mission to the world. Several Terionese eyed the pair warily as they walked in, prompting Zettifar to reach for his lightsaber. However, Greatstorm signaled him to put the weapon away and addressed the tavern's occupants to introduce himself and his Padawan. The Jedi Master then indicated to the bartender that he wished to purchase a round of beverages for the establishment's Terionese patrons. Though skeptical, the worker eventually lined up several glasses and mugs to distribute vinbeer to those in the tavern. When Greatstorm attempted to pay the bartender in Galactic Republic credits, the latter incredulously indicated that they were not accepted as currency. The two Jedi instead repaired the establishment's roof for its owner to pay for the beverages.\n\nAfterward, Greatstorm and Zettifar spent time in the tavern nearly every night, paying for their vinbeer and scrambled grubbub with local currency or promises of work. They often listened intently to the locals' conversations about the state of war on Teriona, which gradually became more informative as the Terionese became more comfortable with their presence. After weeks had passed, the Terionese man Argeel and several other locals visited the Jedi and thanked them for showing them a more peaceful way of life, with the former expressing their gratefulness for fixing the tavern's roof. In 229 BBY, Zettifar reflected on how he and his Master's fixing of the tavern's roof had inspired Teriona's locals to pursue peace.\n\n",

The pilot menu had curry and fruit, the trooper menu had burger and pie, the agent menu had hot dog and milkshake, and the force menu had soup and cookies. The cantina also served HoloSim-themed beverages, where the drink order was tyed to special in-sim benefits through individuals' datapads. These beverages were the Battery Recharger, \"Chip\" Magnet, Smooth Shot, Speed Demon, and XP-Resso. The cantina did not serve the Trandoshan Kiq Zu, for a reason only he and the cantina staff knew.

Prior to the film's release, it was revealed in the film's teaser trailer, which was posted on April 7, 2016. In the trailer, a shot shows a sign naming the bar as Bar Belloq in aurebesh; however, this shot did not make it into the final film where the establishment goes unnamed. Pablo Hidalgo gave the tapcafe's proper name for the first time in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book released alongside the film. Hidalgo created the name in reference to the Decraniated that can be seen inside, who had been known as \"Headless Gesihas\" during production. Hidalgo later clarified that Gesh's Tapcafe was the establishment seen in the film and provided explanation for the alternate names, also calling the building Cafe Belloq, on Twitter on September 23, 2023.\n\n",

The two clones met there to discuss the events surrounding the destruction of Tipoca City, where Cade revealed to Slip at the bar that he was prepared to do whatever it took to bring the truth to light, as Vice Admiral Edmon Rampart, who oversaw the destruction, publicly claimed it was a storm that razed the city. However, as Cade left the bar, he was assassinated by a sniper hired by Rampart. Following the shooting, Slip escaped the scene on a speeder bike and several other clones came outside to see what the situation was, securing the perimeter when they found one of their brothers dead.\n\nLater, Senator Riyo Chuchi traveled to 79's to meet with the clones there, prepared to argue on their behalf in the Senate as they deliberated Rampart's Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill. Several clones were not receptive to working with her, but Chuchi convinced them that they needed to face the reality of being decommissioned and that she wanted to make sure their needs were met.\n\n",

The entrance was a steeped archway topped with a flashing holosign, and the establishment was often packed with the tired workers of Galentro Heavy Works, who worked long hours in the planet's factories. The layout included a long hallway that was lined with several side rooms. A scaffolding stage was situated against one wall, set-up for local bands to provide music for the patrons. One such band that played in the Arcade Omicron was the Screaming Jawas. In the center of the main hallway was a holozoetroscope, one of the the only devices that existed outside of Coruscant. The side rooms were situated with scenic replicators which could transform the small rooms into a variety of different planetary locations.\n\nDuring Operation Death-Hunter, a Rebel infiltration team formed by Colonel Dursa Conegan met up with two of its Rebel contacts, Cooper Dray and Lady Amber Comark in this cantina. The group was lead there by Lady Comark's astromech droid, R2-B4.\n\n",

Javi was familiar with the music genre and considered it a deep cut, but refused the request, telling Toa that the other patrons would not appreciate the intonations.\n\n",

In 21 BBY, the Republic Senate Head of Public Affairs, Mar Rugeyan, had authorized military leave for the clone soldiers of the Grand Army of the Republic at the behest of military contractor Kal Skirata. 79's soon became a popular destination for clone troops on Coruscant leave, leading many to identify the establishment simply as a \"clone bar,\" though 79's served numerous other customers who were not clone soldiers.\n\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, circa 20 BBY, the fugitive Advanced Recon Commando, CT-5555\u2014known by the nickname Fives\u2014came to 79's seeking a way to alert the Jedi Order to a conspiracy he had unintentionally discovered, and clear his name of the accusations lobbied against him by those who wanted the danger covered up. That night, 79's hosted several dozen off-duty clone troopers and non-clone Republic officers, as well as civilian customers of various races, including Twi'leks, Siniteen, and Dugs. Among the patrons in attendance, Fives located his former comrade from the 501st Legion, Kix. In the privacy of 79's latrine, Fives arranged for Kix to set up a meeting with Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex in order to help the troubled and framed commando. Soon after, shock troopers from the Coruscant Guard arrived in pursuit of Fives, forcing the ARC trooper to sneak out of 79's in order to evade capture. A probe droid which was outside 79's followed the speeder with Fives without him knowing and eventually led him to be found by the the Coruscant Guard shock troopers.\n\n",

On one occasion, he negotiated a deal with Empire to sell them a large supply of T-7 ion disruptor rifles, meeting with Imperial Minister Maketh Tua on the planet Lothal. Their negotiation proved difficult, as the two did not share a common language and had to use the protocol droid C-3PO as a translator. This was used by the crew of the starship Ghost to disrupt the deal in an attempt to steal the disruptors, as by removing the pair's translator they were able to provide their own translation services to Tua and Wabo during a trip from Lothal to Garel.\n\nThe thieves managed to misdirect Tua and the Imperials to the wrong hangar bay in Garel City Spaceport, while they loaded the disruptors onto their own ship. Once Wabo and Tua realized they had been tricked, the Imperials attacked the crew of the Ghost but were unable to prevent them from stealing the weapons, after which Wabo turned on Tua in the belief she had double crossed him.\n\n",

By circa 396 BBY, during his days as a student at Reena University, Axel Greylark let the laboratory's mynocks loose as a prank. Like other pranks carried out by the young man, no investigation could link him and the action, although Dean of Student Life Ry Harket knew for certain Greylark was to blame, even without evidence.\n\nAt one point during the Galactic Civil War, Commander Tylux of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Bellicose led his ship on a chase to capture a spy of the Alliance to Restore the Republic in order to not fail the Sith Lord Darth Vader, eventually commanding the Bellicose to pursue the Rebel ship into an Exogorth that lived in an asteroid field. The Star Destroyer rammed through the space creature, with a number of mynocks that lived inside it taking the opportunity to latch on and feast off the Bellicose. Damage caused by the mynocks and asteroids cost the destroyer its tractor beam, shielding, and brought damage to the ship's hull. Thus, one of Tylux's Imperial officers suspected the rebel had led them into a trap, although the spy had actually been surpirsed by the Star Destroyer's action. The mynocks continued their feast as five Rebel starships arrived to reinforce the spy, firing upon the Bellicose as the crew abandoned the destroyer.\n\nIn 3 ABY, a short time after the Battle of Hoth, the crew of the Millennium Falcon attempted to hide from Vader's personal starfleet in the Hoth asteroid belt, landing in what they assumed to be a cave. In reality, they landed in the gullet of an Exogorth named Sy-O. Unlike other Exogorths, Sy-O loved mynocks and welcomed them into their internal ecosystem. After several mynocks attacked and Captain Han Solo realized what they were standing in, the Falcon and its crew escaped Sy-O.\n\n",

When Imperial stormtroopers entered the cantina and detained the pair, the rest of the customers in the Wanton Wellspring booed and cursed at the troopers. Shortly after the incident, Obitt noticed his contact Matese, a former Republic Intelligence direct action operative who now served the Empire, enter the Wellspring and sit at a corner table far away from the bar. Obitt made his way over, with Matese informally greeting him by saying that he hated the song that was playing. After a conversation, Matese offered Obitt work in smuggling arms. Obitt accepted the job and worked with Yalli, Ribert, and the other human to deliver Separatist weapons to the planet Samovar.\n\nAfter the job, which had resulted in Obitt and the others making more money than they had made during the entire war, Matese insisted Obitt return to Jibuto to meet with him at the Wanton Wellspring. As he entered the establishment, the Gamorrean bouncers ushered him inside despite the line to get in, and as Obitt made his way towards the corner table that Matese had reserved, he noticed many other smugglers inside staring at him. Although Matese was not present, Obitt say and waited for them. The smuggler Molo approached Obitt and began questioning Obitt about the nature of his job on Samovar. Obitt learned that the weapons drop had been an Imperial operation designed to \"discover\" the weapons on the planet and use the event as a means to strip the planet of its Legacy world status, meaning the Empire could begin mining operations there. Molo accused Obitt of being an Imperial sympathizer for working with an undercover Imperial like Matese, but when Matese entered Molo left and returned to his own table. Matese feigned innocence on the nature of the job on Samovar and gave Obitt another weapons delivery job, which would involve travel to the planet Wadi Raffa.\n\nshortly before they carried out a smuggling operation. Later, following his stand against the Galactic Empire, Obitt returned to the Wanton Wellspring and received a hero's welcome at the Wellspring.\n\n",

The droids had crablike bodies and manipulator arms, with which they dismantled machinery. The Nihil employed scav droids on Rekelos, during an attack on the Cyclor Shipyards, and an attack on the Republic Fair on the planet Valo.\n\nThe scav droids were designed and engineered to dismantle, salvage, and steal whatever the Nihil needed. Former Tempest Runner Pan Eyta also made use of scav droids, made out of older models of droids due to being low on resources, in the crew he led after being betrayed by Eye Marchion Ro and fellow Runner Lourna Dee. Despite their primary purpose for disassembly, the slicer Quin Carree was able to force scav droids to repair technology.\n\nAn associate of Deva Lompop deployed a group of scav droids to disassemble a pair of TIE/IN interceptors that were disabled by an ion blast from the Vector Bundle above Hynestia.\n\n",

The exterior of the cantina also appeared very briefly in a scene added to the Star Tours: The Adventures Continue attraction on November 17, 2017. Further details were revealed during the Galactic Nights event on December 16 of the same year via two trading cards that gave some details of the locations and expected elements of the park. The first, the cover of the card, revealed that RX-24 from the original Star Tours was re-purposed as a DJ, with the new name \"R3X,\" and the second, as part of the map portion of the card, revealed that it acted as the local watering hole, was located near Smuggler's Alley, and that one of its beverages was Blurrgfire. It included two Aurebesh statements on its borders, stating, \"BLACK WAS THE SPIRE THAT\" and \"CALLED ME TO STAY.\"\n\nAccording to the Walt Disney World News Today fan site, the cantina is the place where one can purchase drinks, as well as interact with various criminals, bounty hunters, and smugglers, and see live music performed. A piece of concept art released earlier by Disney resembled the card's image of the cantina. A name and more details were revealed on August 30, 2018 on the Disney Parks Blog.\n\n",

        "content": "# Old Jho's Pit Stop - Description[]\n\nOne of the few places where Lothal's old frontier spirit survived, Old Jho's Pit Stop was a remote repair facility and docking bay located in the heart of a small outpost informally known as \"Jhothal,\" both of which were named after the facility's owner, an Ithorian named Jho. Located hours from Capital City, the Pit Stop's main attraction was a quaint cantina where Old Jho served drinks, popular with locals and travelers alike, beneath which was a storeroom. A holoprojector was mounted on the wall behind the bar. Jho kept his antiquated hauler beneath a tarp behind the Pit Stop. Although a very friendly bar owner, the Ithorian kept a hunting blaster under the counter in case of troublemakers.\n\nMany of Jho's furnishing were made from repurposed goods, such as lamps built from pit droids and an overhead fan made out of a gunship engine, as well as repurposed moisture vaporator tanks. Scavenged relics from the Clone Wars were scattered around the bar to remind patrons of the galaxy's wartime history, including a Phase I clone trooper helmet on a shelf behind the bar and what appeared to be the nose of a Low Altitude Assault Transport known as the Crumb Bomber, which Jho claimed was authentic, was mounted above its hangar bay entrance. The repair facility's signage, written in a combination of Outer Rim Basic and Aurebesh, was featured on a pair of LAAT/i wings attached on either side of the gunship's nose.\n\nThe Pit Stop was said to be the only place on Lothal where one could enjoy refreshments while their vehicle's power converters were being changed. Unlike some, Jho did not discriminate, and as long as one had credits to spare, he would serve whatever a customer wanted, which included humans, humanoids, and even droids, whether it was bantha milk or lubricator fluid. However, Old Jho's Pit Stop was not particularly Empire-friendly, ignoring an Imperial mandate that the HoloNet News be played at all times. Despite this, TIE fighter pilots and other Imperials could still be found there. The Pit stop offered a discreet meeting place to smugglers, gamblers, and the occasional Imperial.\n\nJho served simple meals and drinks such as spicebrew, ice-cold fizzy, and ice water, as well as desserts such as space waffles with muja sauce, minced Loth-rat pie, jogan fruitcake, blue milk custard, and spiced nysillin tea. After Jho was executed for aiding the Rebellion in 1 BBY, the bar was taken over by Baron Valen Rudor, who turned it into a haunt popular with Imperial personnel.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Behind the scenes[]\n\nGregor first appeared in \"Missing in Action,\" an episode of the fifth season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. A preview clip featuring Gregor was later shown at Celebration VI. He is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. A trailer for the show's fifth season includes Aurebesh on Gregor's profile notes indicating that he went missing in action during the Battle of Sarrish.\n\nDuring the episode, a hologram showing Gregor's military records was displayed in Aurebesh after R2-D2 scanned his identifying code. As well as displaying Gregor's status as MIA during the Battle of Sarrish, it displayed \"SGT 1st Class,\" \"212 Attack Battalion,\" and \"Foxtrot Group,\" as well as Gregor's height and weight. The designation of SGT 1st Class contradicts Colonel Gascon stating that Gregor was a captain, despite the fact that Gascon was going off of the hologram.\n\nThe markings on Gregor's helmet were inspired by the hash-marks that Boston Bruins goaltender Gerry Cheevers stenciled on his mask to denote the stitches he would get had he not been wearing protective gear.\n\nBaker later reprised his role as Gregor in the second season of the Disney XD animated television series Star Wars Rebels; appearing in the episodes \"The Lost Commanders\" and \"Relics of the Old Republic,\" which premiered on October 8, 2015 at the 2015 New York Comic Con. He was erroneously referred to as a Clone Commander in the former episode. Three years later, Baker reprised his role as Gregor once more in the final Rebels episodes \"A Fool's Hope\" and \"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell,\" which premiered on March 5, 2018 on Disney XD.\n\nDuring development of the Star Wars Adventures: The Clone Wars \u2013 Battle Tales comic book series, Michael Moreci wanted to have Gregor make an appearance, but he was not allowed to do so.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Mission to Geonosis[]\n\nIn 2 BBY, Saw led a mission to investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species of the planet Geonosis. His Partisan group had become one of the many cells that would form the Rebel Alliance. Saw undertook the Geonosian mission on behalf of Rebel Command and Senator Bail Organa, an ally of the growing rebellion in the Imperial Senate. His team lost contact with Rebel Command after picking up an energy reading, which turned out to be an operational deflector shield generator.\n\nWhile exploring an underground labyrinth, Saw and his team were ambushed by Klik-Klak, the sole Geonosian to have survived the Sterilization of Geonosis. Klik-Klak's battle droids killed Saw's team but Saw managed to survive long enough for members of the Spectres rebel cell and Rex to rescue him. Saw saved the Spectres and Rex from a group of B1 battle droids and a droideka. Believing that the \"bug\" Klik-Klak was key to finding out why the Empire had exterminated the population of Geonosis, Saw convinced Rex and the Spectres to help him capture Klik-Klak.\n\nWhile exploring the central air shaft, Saw and his team discovered Klik-Klak hiding on the other side. While the Spectres Ezra Bridger and Chopper pursued the Geonosian, Saw waited with Kanan and Rex when the Spectres' leader Hera Syndulla contacted Kanan. When Hera told them to leave, Saw convinced the Spectres to delay their stay so that they could complete his original mission to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian species. Using the Force, Kanan used a stone bridge to ferry Saw and Rex safely across to the other side of the air shaft.\n\nOnce they had crossed, Saw and his rebel companions managed to corner Klik-Klak. Saw also shot out Klik Klak's remote controller with his blaster; deactivating several droidekas which were attacking the Spectres Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios above. Saw then interrogated Klik-Klak and demanded to know what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Unable to speak Galactic Basic Standard, Klik-Klak drew in the sand repeatedly. Ezra managed to befriend Klik-Klak. After Chopper picked up an energy reading, Saw forced Klik-Klak to lead them to the source.\n\nSaw and his companions soon discovered the energy reading came from Klik-Klak's nest, which served as his workshop and contained a transmitter. Still bitter about the loss of his sister Steela at the hands of the Separatists, Saw aggressively questioned Klik-Klak and rummaged through his place. Saw's aggressive methods yielded no results while Ezra's gentler methods convinced Klik-Klak to reveal that he was the custodian of the last known Geonosian queen egg. Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak off-world but Ezra objected on the grounds that Klik-Klak and the egg were among the last of their species and belonged on Geonosis. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise whereby the rebels could question Klik-Klak at Chopper Base and then return him to Geonosis.\n\nSaw, his rebel allies and their prisoner Klik-Klak rendezvoused with the Spectres' ship Ghost in the central air shaft. Once aboard, Saw exchanged pleasantries with Hera and the rest of her crew. While Kanan and Hera were preoccupied, Saw reneged on his earlier agreement and tried to take Klik-Klak off-world on the shuttle Phantom II. To force Klik-Klak's cooperation, Saw shocked him with an electro-shock device. This sparked an argument with the Spectres and Rex, who all objected to Saw's harsh methods. After fighting off Ezra and Rex, Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg. In response, Ezra and Rex urged him not to become like the Empire he was fighting against.\n\nSaw's argument with the Spectres was interrupted by the arrival of Captain Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser, which blocked the air shaft and deployed a squad of Jumptroopers to board the Ghost.

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Assassination of Moff Panaka[]\n\nIn 3 BBY, Gerrera, shaven his head bald again, arranged for a bomb to detonate at the residence of Moff Quarsh Panaka. The bomb achieved its objective of killing the Moff who was supposedly one of the Emperor's most loyal servants. The timing of the bomb narrowly missed killing Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan and Naboo's queen Daln\u00e9, who had only just bid farewell to the Moff in his chalet moments before the explosion after discussing improving the working conditions of the miners on Onoam. Although no real proof was ever given that Saw ordered the Moff's death, Leia's mother Breha Organa correctly surmised that as leader of the Partisans, he must have been involved in some way and told Leia that she and her husband would be telling Saw how close he had come to murdering their daughter.\n\nThe assassination of Panaka greatly upset the rest of the rebels, who became increasingly frustrated at trying to keep the Partisans in line, as Panaka was the highest ranking member of the Emperor's inner circle that they had any hope of contacting some day and possibly even working with. With Saw's actions this was no longer a possibility. Princess Leia also didn't approve of Panaka's assassination as she viewed him as a good man though she initially allowed the Partisan she saw on Onoam to escape Imperial arrest as she feared that her parents may have been involved in the assassination, an accusation that greatly angered and offended Bail Organa.\n\nUnbeknownst to Gerrera, his actions had indirectly saved Leia and her adoptive family as during Panaka's meeting with her and Danl\u00e9, Leia was wearing the jubilation dress that was once worn by her biological mother Padm\u00e9 Amidala which caused Panaka a great shock, and he managed to deduce Leia's heritage, unknown to even the princess at the time, and had planned on telling Palpatine however his death prevented this.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Mission to Geonosis[]\n\nIn 2 BBY, Saw led a mission to investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species of the planet Geonosis. His Partisan group had become one of the many cells that would form the Rebel Alliance. Saw undertook the Geonosian mission on behalf of Rebel Command and Senator Bail Organa, an ally of the growing rebellion in the Imperial Senate. His team lost contact with Rebel Command after picking up an energy reading, which turned out to be an operational deflector shield generator.\n\nWhile exploring an underground labyrinth, Saw and his team were ambushed by Klik-Klak, the sole Geonosian to have survived the Sterilization of Geonosis. Klik-Klak's battle droids killed Saw's team but Saw managed to survive long enough for members of the Spectres rebel cell and Rex to rescue him. Saw saved the Spectres and Rex from a group of B1 battle droids and a droideka. Believing that the \"bug\" Klik-Klak was key to finding out why the Empire had exterminated the population of Geonosis, Saw convinced Rex and the Spectres to help him capture Klik-Klak.\n\nWhile exploring the central air shaft, Saw and his team discovered Klik-Klak hiding on the other side. While the Spectres Ezra Bridger and Chopper pursued the Geonosian, Saw waited with Kanan and Rex when the Spectres' leader Hera Syndulla contacted Kanan. When Hera told them to leave, Saw convinced the Spectres to delay their stay so that they could complete his original mission to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian species. Using the Force, Kanan used a stone bridge to ferry Saw and Rex safely across to the other side of the air shaft.\n\nOnce they had crossed, Saw and his rebel companions managed to corner Klik-Klak. Saw also shot out Klik Klak's remote controller with his blaster; deactivating several droidekas which were attacking the Spectres Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios above. Saw then interrogated Klik-Klak and demanded to know what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Unable to speak Galactic Basic Standard, Klik-Klak drew in the sand repeatedly. Ezra managed to befriend Klik-Klak. After Chopper picked up an energy reading, Saw forced Klik-Klak to lead them to the source.\n\nSaw and his companions soon discovered the energy reading came from Klik-Klak's nest, which served as his workshop and contained a transmitter. Still bitter about the loss of his sister Steela at the hands of the Separatists, Saw aggressively questioned Klik-Klak and rummaged through his place. Saw's aggressive methods yielded no results while Ezra's gentler methods convinced Klik-Klak to reveal that he was the custodian of the last known Geonosian queen egg. Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak off-world but Ezra objected on the grounds that Klik-Klak and the egg were among the last of their species and belonged on Geonosis. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise whereby the rebels could question Klik-Klak at Chopper Base and then return him to Geonosis.\n\nSaw, his rebel allies and their prisoner Klik-Klak rendezvoused with the Spectres' ship Ghost in the central air shaft. Once aboard, Saw exchanged pleasantries with Hera and the rest of her crew. While Kanan and Hera were preoccupied, Saw reneged on his earlier agreement and tried to take Klik-Klak off-world on the shuttle Phantom II. To force Klik-Klak's cooperation, Saw shocked him with an electro-shock device. This sparked an argument with the Spectres and Rex, who all objected to Saw's harsh methods. After fighting off Ezra and Rex, Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg. In response, Ezra and Rex urged him not to become like the Empire he was fighting against.\n\nSaw's argument with the Spectres was interrupted by the arrival of Captain Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser, which blocked the air shaft and deployed a squad of Jumptroopers to board the Ghost. Saw joined the rebels in repelling the Imperial boarders as the ship descended into the depths of Geonosis. Once at the bottom, Saw and his rebel comrades discovered several poison canisters which provided compelling evidence that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. Regretting his past behavior towards Klik-Klak, Saw argued that the Geonosians deserved the same right to rebuild as other peoples and released Klik-Klak and the Geonosian egg.\n\nAfter releasing Klik-Klak and taking several of the poison canisters, the Ghost managed to escape Geonosis by blasting through the Imperial light cruiser with proton torpedoes. Despite their successful escape, the rebels lost the poison canisters and were forced to make do with images of the canisters instead. Though Senator Organa and Commander Jun Sato regarded the mission as a success for rescuing Saw and obtaining a new deflector core, Saw was disappointed that they still had not found out what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Kanan reassured him that they would eventually find out sooner or later.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Behind the scenes[]\n\nThe character of Saw Gerrera was voiced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: The Bad Batch by Andrew Kishino. Saw Gerrera was played by Forest Whitaker in the 2016 Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, who returned to voice the character in Star Wars Rebels and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. He was originally conceived by Star Wars creator George Lucas for the unproduced live-action television series Star Wars: Underworld.\n\nAccordingly, the character's name is a \"mnemonic riff\" on real-life Argentinian revolutionary and associate of Castro - Che Guevara as revealed in The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Lucasfilm Story Group's Kiri Hart was the one who suggested that the character be used in Rogue One. Another inspiration for Gerrera's character, according to Phil Szostak, was Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz from Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now. According to writer Gary Whitta, Forest Whitaker was the only actor they considered to play Gerrera in Rogue One.\n\nWhitaker reprised his role as Gerrera in the episodes \"Narkina 5\" and \"Daughter of Ferrix\" in the Andor television series. Executive producer and writer Tony Gilroy wanted Gerrera and the other legacy characters to not provide fan service. The night before a rehearsal for Gerrera and Luthen Rael's argument in \"Narkina 5,\" Whitaker asked director Toby Haynes questions about backstory and kyber crystals. During the rehearsal, Whitaker and Rael's actor, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, read the scene for the first time and went at each other. According to Haynes, when the scene was filmed for real, Whitaker and Skarsg\u00e5rd almost deconstructed what they did in a natural and spontaneous way. They then had to completely reconstruct the scene, and it was hard to get to the same pitch. Haynes wanted to end Gerrera's rant with a very direct, face-on shot of Whitaker to build the intensity and bring the audience into the argument. To accomplish this, Haynes had Whitaker do his speech several times, telling him to \"go crazy with it.\"\n\n",

        "content": "# Alternative Aurebesh numerals - Behind the scenes[]\n\nAurebesh was originally created by Stephen Crane of West End Games, for the 1993 book Star Wars Miniatures Battles Companion. Crane based the alphabet on an unidentified script seen on the on the monitor readouts on the second Death Star at the beginning of the 1983 movie Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. However, Crane never created numbers for the Aurebesh alphabet, because the Death Star monitors in film show regular Arabic numerals.\n\nHowever, an unrelated numerical system made up of dots and lines first appeared in the West End Games sourcebook Platt's Starport Guide, which features a graphic called \"Current transponder code profile\", with the numerals along both axes of a graph. Unlike later appearances, numerals for 0 through 16 are represented. The graph was reused for the West End Games publication Star Wars Gamemaster Screen, Revised, and the West End Games sourcebook Stock Ships.\n\nThese numerals were digitized by Star Wars fan Peter Schuster in 1998, as part of an alternate Aurebesh font that Schuster named New Aurabesh, which can be downloaded online. Although most canon appearances of Aurebesh use Arabic numbers, the alternative font has also appeared in various Star Wars media, although it has never been named.\n\nIn Star Wars canon, these numerals first appeared on a map of destinations on the subtram in the Coruscant Underworld, created for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"To Catch a Jedi.\" However, although the map does appear on-screen in the episode, it is too far away to decipher.\n\nThe only Star Wars canon media to map any of the alternate numbers are the 2014 Episode Guide for Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion on StarWars.com, whose Concept Art Gallery includes a translation for a sign on Lothal, containing the numbers 7, 1, 8 and 9; and the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia, which presents an Aurebesh font which includes two examples of Aurebesh numbers, 3 and 7. Both these sources use West End Games' alternate font.\n\nConcept art for the Star Wars Resistance episode \"Descent\" on StarWars.com reveals an unused design for two First Order officers wearing a rank insignia on their sleeve, which says \"HAL 4\". However, the insignia do not appear in the finished episode.\n\nCostume concept art by Glyn Dillon in the behind-the-scenes book The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker shows Finn wearing a yellow jacket with Aurebesh on the back, reading \"FN 2187\", \"FINN\"/\"TICO\". The inscription is written in an alternative Aurebesh font and alternative numerals.\n\n",

With a bar as well as a gambling area with a sabacc table, the outpost's entrance was guarded, making it a difficult place to gain access to.\n\nThe human Lando Calrissian visited the jungle outpost soon after leaving Savareen aboard a battered Millennium Falcon, his personal YT-1300 light freighter. However, Calrissian was tracked down by the human Han Solo and the faithful Wookiee Chewbacca.\n\nSolo sat down with Calrissian in a game of sabacc, famously winning the Millennium Falcon in the process.

Around 9 ABY, a Mythrol was a customer in the bar when he was threatened by two humans (an alpha and beta) and a Quarren. A bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian arrived to collect a bounty on the Mythrol, and, despite the attempted intervention of the bartender, a fight ensued between the Mandalorian and the three companions threatening the Mythrol. The Mandalorian won the fight, incapacitating the two humans and bisecting the Quarren by forcing the bar's front entrance to close over his body.\n\n",

        "content": "# The Domak Refectory - History[]\n\nThe building was originally an refectory for one of the Dai Bendu monasteries in Kijimi City. After the monks disappeared, the building became a business.\n\nBy 3 ABY, the Domak Refectory began specializing in hot teas, soups and stew such as Kyumo stew. It had a Fathier racing betting station installed which projected races from Canto Bight. A Melitto member of the Ashiga Clan named Mehdo had a high\u2013roller Kessel Sabacc parlor in a backroom of the refectory.\n\nIn 3 ABY, Kay Vess visited the Domak Refectory when looking for the Chadra-Fan explosives expert, Ank Parako who was a regular at the cantina. A bartender at the cantina informed Vess that Parako had been forced to work at the Ashiga weapons factory on Kijimi after a job went south. After improving her relationship with the Ashiga Clan, Vess was contacted by Krisk Ashiga, daughter of the clan's queen, to meet at the Refectory. Once there Vess was introduced to Qi'ra, the leader of the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Vess learned that Krisk was planning a coup on queen Ashiga with the support of Crimson Dawn and that the group wanted Vess to free Parako from the weapons factory.\n\nDuring the same year, a human mercenary named Rooster Trace spent her time at the reflectory after the Galactic Empire destroyed here ship and confiscated her weapons. Kranash, a Trandoshan contract broker, operated out of the entrance of the cantina. A copy of episode 44 of the Glarnok & Yabassi holodrama and a copy of Jet Kordo's journal entry on bounty hunters had been left in the cantina. EE'zok's keycard to Crimson Dawn's vault on the planet had also been left on a loft at the reflectory.\n\nKay Vess took several jobs from individuals at the cantina, including from a Crimson Dawn enforcer and an arms dealer. A datapad left at the cantina gave Vess the code to unlock a gate and retrieve a stash of goods left by an individual named Venti. Vess also approached Rooster Trace about getting training with heavy weapons, however Trace refused. During the conversation, Trace disclosed her trouble with the Empire. After Vess was able to track down Trace's confiscated weapons to Tatooine, Trace decided to leave the cantina and meet Vess.\n\n",

Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Leids was a patron of Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on the planet Tatooine. He was standing at the cantina's bar when Luke Skywalker entered with C-3PO and R2-D2, a pair of droids, turning around when the bartender Wuher informed them of the establishment's no droid policy.\n\nLeids had brown skin and a pair of large, black eyes, and, because his species evolved to breathe methane, not oxygen, he wore a breath mask and carried his own supply of the gas while on Tatooine.\n\nMany years later, Leids was present on Oba Diah, where he told Karr Nuq Sin about Skywalker and Kenobi's appearance at the cantina, though Leids did not remember what planet it had occurred on, just that it had two suns.\n\n",

When close enough, the beam would turn red, indicating the person or creature is in imminent danger of being blown up. By 9 BBY, the origins of the roller mine were shrouded in mystery. Many assumed the droid was made for blasting through rock and debris, and some claim it was created by one of the earliest priorite prospectors. At one point, the Gotarite prospector Soont Madas attempted to use roller mines to access a Jedi Meditation Chamber on Koboh.

While Yalli sipped an iced beverage, the smugglers lamented the growing shortage of work. As they argued about the band's music, with Obitt expressing distaste for the song they were playing, two other patrons in the cantina drew knives and began a fight. When Imperial stormtroopers entered the cantina and detained the pair, the rest of the customers in the Wanton Wellspring booed and cursed at the troopers. Shortly after the incident, Obitt noticed his contact Matese, a former Republic Intelligence direct action operative who now served the Empire, enter the Wellspring and sit at a corner table far away from the bar. Obitt made his way over, with Matese informally greeting him by saying that he hated the song that was playing. After a conversation, Matese offered Obitt work in smuggling arms. Obitt accepted the job and worked with Yalli, Ribert, and the other human to deliver Separatist weapons to the planet Samovar.\n\nAfter the job, which had resulted in Obitt and the others making more money than they had made during the entire war, Matese insisted Obitt return to Jibuto to meet with him at the Wanton Wellspring. As he entered the establishment, the Gamorrean bouncers ushered him inside despite the line to get in, and as Obitt made his way towards the corner table that Matese had reserved, he noticed many other smugglers inside staring at him. Although Matese was not present, Obitt say and waited for them. The smuggler Molo approached Obitt and began questioning Obitt about the nature of his job on Samovar. Obitt learned that the weapons drop had been an Imperial operation designed to \"discover\" the weapons on the planet and use the event as a means to strip the planet of its Legacy world status, meaning the Empire could begin mining operations there. Molo accused Obitt of being an Imperial sympathizer for working with an undercover Imperial like Matese, but when Matese entered Molo left and returned to his own table. Matese feigned innocence on the nature of the job on Samovar and gave Obitt another weapons delivery job, which would involve travel to the planet Wadi Raffa.\n\nshortly before they carried out a smuggling operation. Later, following his stand against the Galactic Empire, Obitt returned to the Wanton Wellspring and received a hero's welcome at the Wellspring.\n\n",

It could only be performed underwater and used the low-frequency band as a carrier for deep-sea telemetry.\n\nIn 9 BBY, having read about the intonations, the academic Toa requested that the music producer Ashe Javi have the DJ droid DD-EC play Anselmi throat intonations at the cantina Pyloon's Saloon on the planet Koboh, suggesting that they could decode the subaqueous music in atmosphere. Javi was familiar with the music genre and considered it a deep cut, but refused the request, telling Toa that the other patrons would not appreciate the intonations.\n\n",

        "content": "# Old Jho's Pit Stop - Description[]\n\nOne of the few places where Lothal's old frontier spirit survived, Old Jho's Pit Stop was a remote repair facility and docking bay located in the heart of a small outpost informally known as \"Jhothal,\" both of which were named after the facility's owner, an Ithorian named Jho. Located hours from Capital City, the Pit Stop's main attraction was a quaint cantina where Old Jho served drinks, popular with locals and travelers alike, beneath which was a storeroom. A holoprojector was mounted on the wall behind the bar. Jho kept his antiquated hauler beneath a tarp behind the Pit Stop. Although a very friendly bar owner, the Ithorian kept a hunting blaster under the counter in case of troublemakers.\n\nMany of Jho's furnishing were made from repurposed goods, such as lamps built from pit droids and an overhead fan made out of a gunship engine, as well as repurposed moisture vaporator tanks. Scavenged relics from the Clone Wars were scattered around the bar to remind patrons of the galaxy's wartime history, including a Phase I clone trooper helmet on a shelf behind the bar and what appeared to be the nose of a Low Altitude Assault Transport known as the Crumb Bomber, which Jho claimed was authentic, was mounted above its hangar bay entrance. The repair facility's signage, written in a combination of Outer Rim Basic and Aurebesh, was featured on a pair of LAAT/i wings attached on either side of the gunship's nose.\n\nThe Pit Stop was said to be the only place on Lothal where one could enjoy refreshments while their vehicle's power converters were being changed. Unlike some, Jho did not discriminate, and as long as one had credits to spare, he would serve whatever a customer wanted, which included humans, humanoids, and even droids, whether it was bantha milk or lubricator fluid. However, Old Jho's Pit Stop was not particularly Empire-friendly, ignoring an Imperial mandate that the HoloNet News be played at all times. Despite this, TIE fighter pilots and other Imperials could still be found there. The Pit stop offered a discreet meeting place to smugglers, gamblers, and the occasional Imperial.\n\nJho served simple meals and drinks such as spicebrew, ice-cold fizzy, and ice water, as well as desserts such as space waffles with muja sauce, minced Loth-rat pie, jogan fruitcake, blue milk custard, and spiced nysillin tea. After Jho was executed for aiding the Rebellion in 1 BBY, the bar was taken over by Baron Valen Rudor, who turned it into a haunt popular with Imperial personnel.\n\n",

Its design was based on a Ralph McQuarrie sketch that depicted the interior of Jabba's Palace.\n\nThe cantina was first unveiled during the D23 Expo for 2017 via a scale model of the Galaxy's Edge park area. The exterior of the cantina also appeared very briefly in a scene added to the Star Tours: The Adventures Continue attraction on November 17, 2017. Further details were revealed during the Galactic Nights event on December 16 of the same year via two trading cards that gave some details of the locations and expected elements of the park. The first, the cover of the card, revealed that RX-24 from the original Star Tours was re-purposed as a DJ, with the new name \"R3X,\" and the second, as part of the map portion of the card, revealed that it acted as the local watering hole, was located near Smuggler's Alley, and that one of its beverages was Blurrgfire. It included two Aurebesh statements on its borders, stating, \"BLACK WAS THE SPIRE THAT\" and \"CALLED ME TO STAY.\"\n\nAccording to the Walt Disney World News Today fan site, the cantina is the place where one can purchase drinks, as well as interact with various criminals, bounty hunters, and smugglers, and see live music performed. A piece of concept art released earlier by Disney resembled the card's image of the cantina. A name and more details were revealed on August 30, 2018 on the Disney Parks Blog.\n\n",

Being an MPO-1400 model, manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, and belonging to the family of Purrgil-class starcruisers, the Halcyon was distinguished as the \"jewel\" of the cruise liner company.\n\nThe Halcyon was propelled by an array of 13 engine units, whilst also possessing a ventral hanger bay, similar to that of the infamous line of Star Destroyers of the Galactic Empire. The vessel possessed a pair of docking rings, along the port and starboard sides of its spine, in addition to two of both sides of its bow, which were designated for Launch Pod Docks. The docks onboard, equipped with airlocks, would accept the passengers of the multiple Launch Pods from a planet-bound terminal, as they rendezvous with the Star Cruiser. Another set of docks, referred to as Transport Docks, were designated for transport shuttles docking with the starship. During 34 ABY, transport shuttles belonging to the Batuu Transport Company would service the passengers aboard the Halcyon, by taking individuals to the Batuu hub of Black Spire Outpost during denoted excursion periods.\n\n",

On one occasion, he negotiated a deal with Empire to sell them a large supply of T-7 ion disruptor rifles, meeting with Imperial Minister Maketh Tua on the planet Lothal. Their negotiation proved difficult, as the two did not share a common language and had to use the protocol droid C-3PO as a translator. This was used by the crew of the starship Ghost to disrupt the deal in an attempt to steal the disruptors, as by removing the pair's translator they were able to provide their own translation services to Tua and Wabo during a trip from Lothal to Garel.\n\nThe thieves managed to misdirect Tua and the Imperials to the wrong hangar bay in Garel City Spaceport, while they loaded the disruptors onto their own ship. Once Wabo and Tua realized they had been tricked, the Imperials attacked the crew of the Ghost but were unable to prevent them from stealing the weapons, after which Wabo turned on Tua in the belief she had double crossed him.\n\n",

By circa 396 BBY, during his days as a student at Reena University, Axel Greylark let the laboratory's mynocks loose as a prank. Like other pranks carried out by the young man, no investigation could link him and the action, although Dean of Student Life Ry Harket knew for certain Greylark was to blame, even without evidence.\n\nAt one point during the Galactic Civil War, Commander Tylux of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Bellicose led his ship on a chase to capture a spy of the Alliance to Restore the Republic in order to not fail the Sith Lord Darth Vader, eventually commanding the Bellicose to pursue the Rebel ship into an Exogorth that lived in an asteroid field. The Star Destroyer rammed through the space creature, with a number of mynocks that lived inside it taking the opportunity to latch on and feast off the Bellicose. Damage caused by the mynocks and asteroids cost the destroyer its tractor beam, shielding, and brought damage to the ship's hull. Thus, one of Tylux's Imperial officers suspected the rebel had led them into a trap, although the spy had actually been surpirsed by the Star Destroyer's action. The mynocks continued their feast as five Rebel starships arrived to reinforce the spy, firing upon the Bellicose as the crew abandoned the destroyer.\n\nIn 3 ABY, a short time after the Battle of Hoth, the crew of the Millennium Falcon attempted to hide from Vader's personal starfleet in the Hoth asteroid belt, landing in what they assumed to be a cave. In reality, they landed in the gullet of an Exogorth named Sy-O. Unlike other Exogorths, Sy-O loved mynocks and welcomed them into their internal ecosystem. After several mynocks attacked and Captain Han Solo realized what they were standing in, the Falcon and its crew escaped Sy-O.\n\n",

In 21 BBY, the Republic Senate Head of Public Affairs, Mar Rugeyan, had authorized military leave for the clone soldiers of the Grand Army of the Republic at the behest of military contractor Kal Skirata. 79's soon became a popular destination for clone troops on Coruscant leave, leading many to identify the establishment simply as a \"clone bar,\" though 79's served numerous other customers who were not clone soldiers.\n\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, circa 20 BBY, the fugitive Advanced Recon Commando, CT-5555\u2014known by the nickname Fives\u2014came to 79's seeking a way to alert the Jedi Order to a conspiracy he had unintentionally discovered, and clear his name of the accusations lobbied against him by those who wanted the danger covered up. That night, 79's hosted several dozen off-duty clone troopers and non-clone Republic officers, as well as civilian customers of various races, including Twi'leks, Siniteen, and Dugs. Among the patrons in attendance, Fives located his former comrade from the 501st Legion, Kix. In the privacy of 79's latrine, Fives arranged for Kix to set up a meeting with Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex in order to help the troubled and framed commando. Soon after, shock troopers from the Coruscant Guard arrived in pursuit of Fives, forcing the ARC trooper to sneak out of 79's in order to evade capture. A probe droid which was outside 79's followed the speeder with Fives without him knowing and eventually led him to be found by the the Coruscant Guard shock troopers.\n\n",

The two clones met there to discuss the events surrounding the destruction of Tipoca City, where Cade revealed to Slip at the bar that he was prepared to do whatever it took to bring the truth to light, as Vice Admiral Edmon Rampart, who oversaw the destruction, publicly claimed it was a storm that razed the city. However, as Cade left the bar, he was assassinated by a sniper hired by Rampart. Following the shooting, Slip escaped the scene on a speeder bike and several other clones came outside to see what the situation was, securing the perimeter when they found one of their brothers dead.\n\nLater, Senator Riyo Chuchi traveled to 79's to meet with the clones there, prepared to argue on their behalf in the Senate as they deliberated Rampart's Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill. Several clones were not receptive to working with her, but Chuchi convinced them that they needed to face the reality of being decommissioned and that she wanted to make sure their needs were met.\n\n",

She declined each time, and, upon his last attempt, asked him if she looked like the kind of person who drank the beverage; Ohnaka agreed that Netal did not. According to Resistance spy Vi Moradi, the former First Order stormtrooper Archex was another human who did not seem the type to drink the beverage.\n\nThat year, Julen Rakab and Volt Vescuso, a pair of humans, drank congratulatory Fuzzy Tauntauns at Oga's Cantina after Rakab successfully thwarted Ana Tolla's attack on Saka Homestead.

The character's costume was made up of items from the costumes of several other Mos Eisley Cantina patrons, including Trinto Duaba's robe, M'iiyoom Onith's shirt, and a mask and claws used by fellow Gotals Feltipern Trevagg and Cobb Sonbepol. The mask was designed by conceptual artist Ron Cobb and created by makeup artist Laine Liska.\n\nCostume designer Rick Baker had originally created the claws as props for the 1974 horror film It's Alive. Liska modified the claws with fur for Star Wars. The cantina character Myo also used a separate pair of the same claw props but without the fur.\n\nThe Hennet Kayn character name was first created at the \"Behind the Scenes of the Cantina\" panel at Star Wars Celebration Chicago in 2019.\nAfter panel host Tom Spina discovered production images of Kayn, he and Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee named the character based on panel attendee Kenneth Haynie, who won the honor during the panel.\n\n",

During the clones' fight to retake the station, the droid captain attacked Rex, but Rex instead destroyed the droid by dodging its vibrosword strike, breaking its neck and slamming it face-first into the floor.\n\n",

Multiple QR-units, including Q-4 \"Kew-For\" and CT-Thirty-Eight, served Hutt Clan enforcer Lourna Dee aboard the starcruiser Lourna Dee, previously the Jedi starship Ataraxia. When attempting to reclaim the Ataraxia after Dee turned against the Hutts, Jedi Master Keeve Trennis destroyed the two QR-units. The Jedi Knight Ceret utilized the destroyed Kew-For to retrieve the access code for the Nihil's scav droids. They overwrote Kew-For's autonomy circuits and forced the droid to give them the code, claiming they did not have the time to negotiate with a QR-unit.\n\n",

A preview clip featuring Gregor was later shown at Celebration VI. He is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. A trailer for the show's fifth season includes Aurebesh on Gregor's profile notes indicating that he went missing in action during the Battle of Sarrish.\n\nDuring the episode, a hologram showing Gregor's military records was displayed in Aurebesh after R2-D2 scanned his identifying code. As well as displaying Gregor's status as MIA during the Battle of Sarrish, it displayed \"SGT 1st Class,\" \"212 Attack Battalion,\" and \"Foxtrot Group,\" as well as Gregor's height and weight. The designation of SGT 1st Class contradicts Colonel Gascon stating that Gregor was a captain, despite the fact that Gascon was going off of the hologram.\n\nThe markings on Gregor's helmet were inspired by the hash-marks that Boston Bruins goaltender Gerry Cheevers stenciled on his mask to denote the stitches he would get had he not been wearing protective gear.\n\nBaker later reprised his role as Gregor in the second season of the Disney XD animated television series Star Wars Rebels; appearing in the episodes \"The Lost Commanders\" and \"Relics of the Old Republic,\" which premiered on October 8, 2015 at the 2015 New York Comic Con. He was erroneously referred to as a Clone Commander in the former episode. Three years later, Baker reprised his role as Gregor once more in the final Rebels episodes \"A Fool's Hope\" and \"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell,\" which premiered on March 5, 2018 on Disney XD.\n\nDuring development of the Star Wars Adventures: The Clone Wars \u2013 Battle Tales comic book series, Michael Moreci wanted to have Gregor make an appearance, but he was not allowed to do so.\n\n",

The droids had crablike bodies and manipulator arms, with which they dismantled machinery. The Nihil employed scav droids on Rekelos, during an attack on the Cyclor Shipyards, and an attack on the Republic Fair on the planet Valo.\n\nThe scav droids were designed and engineered to dismantle, salvage, and steal whatever the Nihil needed. Former Tempest Runner Pan Eyta also made use of scav droids, made out of older models of droids due to being low on resources, in the crew he led after being betrayed by Eye Marchion Ro and fellow Runner Lourna Dee. Despite their primary purpose for disassembly, the slicer Quin Carree was able to force scav droids to repair technology.\n\nAn associate of Deva Lompop deployed a group of scav droids to disassemble a pair of TIE/IN interceptors that were disabled by an ion blast from the Vector Bundle above Hynestia.\n\n",

Initially, one scene was to have featured Beru Lars, played by Shelagh Fraser, pouring blue milk into a jug in her kitchen. That footage, however, was left on the cutting room floor. Mark Hamill stated the blue milk was \"life-long milk\" with \"additives \u2013 they put blue food coloring in it \u2013 and it was really ghastly. Oily and sweet and euch! Triggered your gag reflex. But I said, 'Look \u2013 if they gave me blue milk, you bet I'm going to drink it on camera, because what other chance am I going to get?' So there's an indication that I'm an underrated actor \u2013 I gulped it and acted like I liked it without vomiting.\"\n\nThe anthology novel From a Certain Point of View, celebrating the 40th anniversary of A New Hope, was first teased on social media on April 6, 2017, using the hashtag #OperationBlueMilk. The real-world Milk Stand found at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge serves \"blue milk,\" which is actually a frozen plant-based blend of coconut and rice milks that the menu describes as having \"alluring fruity characteristics.\" The Disney's Hollywood Studios location additionally serves an alcoholic Blue Milk Cooler. The real-world Oga's Cantina at both parks serves Blue Bantha, a non-alcoholic cocktail with a cookie.\n\nIn the real world, naturally occurring blue items are rarely edible. Writer Melissa T. Miller dedicated the Star Wars Insider article \"Got Blue Milk?\" to analyzing blue Star Wars items, such as blue milk, and their lack of real world counterparts. In the piece, Miller theorized that blue milk either got its color from its refining process or, drawing on how real world milk can change in hue based on the producer's diet, something ate by Banthas that affected the coloration. Miller specifically pondered if fields of blue wildflowers existed amongst the Tatooine sands. The 2020 non-canon video game expansion The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey to Batuu includes blue milk as a drink sold to the player's Sims at the Milk Stand vendor in the Black Spire Outpost neighborhood. In the home neighborhood, it can be purchased as a quick meal from refrigerators.\n\n",

Crane based the alphabet on an unidentified script seen on the on the monitor readouts on the second Death Star at the beginning of the 1983 movie Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. However, Crane never created numbers for the Aurebesh alphabet, because the Death Star monitors in film show regular Arabic numerals.\n\nHowever, an unrelated numerical system made up of dots and lines first appeared in the West End Games sourcebook Platt's Starport Guide, which features a graphic called \"Current transponder code profile\", with the numerals along both axes of a graph. Unlike later appearances, numerals for 0 through 16 are represented. The graph was reused for the West End Games publication Star Wars Gamemaster Screen, Revised, and the West End Games sourcebook Stock Ships.\n\nThese numerals were digitized by Star Wars fan Peter Schuster in 1998, as part of an alternate Aurebesh font that Schuster named New Aurabesh, which can be downloaded online. Although most canon appearances of Aurebesh use Arabic numbers, the alternative font has also appeared in various Star Wars media, although it has never been named.\n\nIn Star Wars canon, these numerals first appeared on a map of destinations on the subtram in the Coruscant Underworld, created for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"To Catch a Jedi.\" However, although the map does appear on-screen in the episode, it is too far away to decipher.\n\nThe only Star Wars canon media to map any of the alternate numbers are the 2014 Episode Guide for Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion on StarWars.com, whose Concept Art Gallery includes a translation for a sign on Lothal, containing the numbers 7, 1, 8 and 9; and the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia, which presents an Aurebesh font which includes two examples of Aurebesh numbers, 3 and 7. Both these sources use West End Games' alternate font.\n\nConcept art for the Star Wars Resistance episode \"Descent\" on StarWars.com reveals an unused design for two First Order officers wearing a rank insignia on their sleeve, which says \"HAL 4\". However, the insignia do not appear in the finished episode.\n\nCostume concept art by Glyn Dillon in the behind-the-scenes book The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker shows Finn wearing a yellow jacket with Aurebesh on the back, reading \"FN 2187\", \"FINN\"/\"TICO\". The inscription is written in an alternative Aurebesh font and alternative numerals.\n\n",

The tavern's roof eventually developed a hole, which the owner did not repair due to the constant state of strife on the world. By that time, many Strop's End locals enjoyed gathering in the tavern to enjoy alcoholic vinbeer or a bowl of scrambled grubbub.\n\nBetween around 234 BBY and 232 BBY, the Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm and his Padawan, Bell Zettifar, visited the tavern after searching for a communal spot in Strop's End to meet the local community during their mission to the world. Several Terionese eyed the pair warily as they walked in, prompting Zettifar to reach for his lightsaber. However, Greatstorm signaled him to put the weapon away and addressed the tavern's occupants to introduce himself and his Padawan. The Jedi Master then indicated to the bartender that he wished to purchase a round of beverages for the establishment's Terionese patrons. Though skeptical, the worker eventually lined up several glasses and mugs to distribute vinbeer to those in the tavern. When Greatstorm attempted to pay the bartender in Galactic Republic credits, the latter incredulously indicated that they were not accepted as currency. The two Jedi instead repaired the establishment's roof for its owner to pay for the beverages.\n\nAfterward, Greatstorm and Zettifar spent time in the tavern nearly every night, paying for their vinbeer and scrambled grubbub with local currency or promises of work. They often listened intently to the locals' conversations about the state of war on Teriona, which gradually became more informative as the Terionese became more comfortable with their presence. After weeks had passed, the Terionese man Argeel and several other locals visited the Jedi and thanked them for showing them a more peaceful way of life, with the former expressing their gratefulness for fixing the tavern's roof. In 229 BBY, Zettifar reflected on how he and his Master's fixing of the tavern's roof had inspired Teriona's locals to pursue peace.\n\n",

In 34 ABY, it was served in Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet Batuu at Oga's Cantina, an establishment that used a hyperdrive to supply power. During that time, host Palob Godalhi of the Black Spire Outpost radio station BSO 401.72 sometimes told listeners they should visit the cantina and order the beverage.\n\nIn 34 ABY, after the Battle of Takodana, Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs published his cookbook The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook and included a recipe for the beverage, which he enjoyed drinking for its bold flavor and its energizing effects. He compared its ability to provide energy with a hypothetical digestible version of coaxium, a form of hypermatter used as fuel for hyperdrives. Around the same time, Tuggs included his cookbook's recipe for the punch in a small pamphlet of recipes meant to help a Batuu visitor learn more about the planet.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Assassination of Moff Panaka[]\n\nIn 3 BBY, Gerrera, shaven his head bald again, arranged for a bomb to detonate at the residence of Moff Quarsh Panaka. The bomb achieved its objective of killing the Moff who was supposedly one of the Emperor's most loyal servants. The timing of the bomb narrowly missed killing Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan and Naboo's queen Daln\u00e9, who had only just bid farewell to the Moff in his chalet moments before the explosion after discussing improving the working conditions of the miners on Onoam. Although no real proof was ever given that Saw ordered the Moff's death, Leia's mother Breha Organa correctly surmised that as leader of the Partisans, he must have been involved in some way and told Leia that she and her husband would be telling Saw how close he had come to murdering their daughter.\n\nThe assassination of Panaka greatly upset the rest of the rebels, who became increasingly frustrated at trying to keep the Partisans in line, as Panaka was the highest ranking member of the Emperor's inner circle that they had any hope of contacting some day and possibly even working with. With Saw's actions this was no longer a possibility. Princess Leia also didn't approve of Panaka's assassination as she viewed him as a good man though she initially allowed the Partisan she saw on Onoam to escape Imperial arrest as she feared that her parents may have been involved in the assassination, an accusation that greatly angered and offended Bail Organa.\n\nUnbeknownst to Gerrera, his actions had indirectly saved Leia and her adoptive family as during Panaka's meeting with her and Danl\u00e9, Leia was wearing the jubilation dress that was once worn by her biological mother Padm\u00e9 Amidala which caused Panaka a great shock, and he managed to deduce Leia's heritage, unknown to even the princess at the time, and had planned on telling Palpatine however his death prevented this.\n\n",

        "content": "# Alliance to Restore the Republic - The early rebellion[]\n\nHowever, by 5 BBY, a number of rebel cells had formed, operating all across the galaxy as part of an early rebellion against growing Imperial oppression, especially in light of the Empire's continuing expansion throughout the Outer Rim. One insurgency began in the Atrivis sector, where the Liberators seized an Imperial garrison but were devastatingly defeated by the Imperial Navy soon afterwards. A rebel operative named Luthen Rael did much of the on-the-ground early work in forming a network of rebel cells, receiving funding from and working alongside Senator Mon Mothma. Mothma also established a rebel cell of her own at some point. The three principle architects of the Rebel Alliance would prove to be Mothma, Senator Bail Organa, and Partisan leader Saw Gerrera, the most extreme of the three. Organa and former Jedi Ahsoka Tano operated as part of their own resistance movement that would fall into the larger whole of an emerging alliance of rebel cells.\n\nWith the Empire beginning to take notice of Mothma's banking activities, Rael set up a rebel infiltration team under Mothma's cousin Vel Sartha to steal the quarterly payroll for the Imperial sector surrounding the planet Aldhani. Rael also reasoned such a major strike against the Empire would make the regime lash out, inspiring more people to rise up as they suffered under a sudden burst of Imperial tyranny. However, the success of the Aldhani mission effectively froze Mothma's bank accounts under new laws, thereby leaving Mothma with few ways to even out her accounts before the Empire fully investigated. In the end, the only solution before Mothma was to marry her daughter Leida off to the son of Chandrilan oligarch Davo Sculdun. If she went through with the proposal, Sculdun promised to deposit into her account, thereby covering up the missing funds she had delivered to Rael.\n\nWhile Mothma could find Rael's tactics hard to stomach, particularly his usage of the Aldhani heist to hasten the speed of Imperial oppression in the name of inspiring more people to rebel, she did reflect in her personal journal that the Rebellion she was helping to form needed to show its teeth, lest Palpatine's military crush it in its infancy. While she did have hope of a peaceful end to the conflict in the Senate, she and Bail Organa helped organize paramilitary attacks from the shadows, all while presenting themselves as principled dissenters in public. Furthermore, she knew that the galaxy's assorted rebel cells needed to unify in the name of opposing Palpatine or else each would be hunted down one by one.\n\nRael also met with Saw Gerrera of the Partisans in an effort to convince him to work alongside former Separatist Anto Kreegyr's group, arguing that the rebel cells, despite their political differences, needed to join together to become a true threat to the Empire. By the time Gerrera agreed, the Imperial Security Bureau had discovered Kreegyr's looming raid on the Spellhaus Imperial power station. Reasoning that Kreegyr's demise would make the ISB overconfident and protect Rael's agent within the ISB, Lonni Jung, the two reluctantly agreed to sacrifice Kreegyr's forces for the greater good of their war effort. Shortly afterward, the raid indeed ended in the total destruction of Kreegyr's attack party. Following the Rix Road riot, Rael also formally recruited Cassian Jeron Andor into his network. The Atrivis Resistance Group, led by Travia Chan, was also active in the Atrivis sector. After deliberation, they decided to join Mothma, becoming one of the first groups of what Mothma had begun calling \"the Alliance.\"\n\nOne rebel cell was the Spectres, which largely fought on the Imperial-controlled Outer Rim planet of Lothal. Another rebel cell was Phoenix Cell, led by Commander Jun Sato, which was a part of the larger rebel network led by Tano and Senator Organa. At that point, members of those cells were not supposed to know they were part of a larger movement known as the rebellion, so if captured, they could not give information on the other rebel cells. The cells were only provided with intelligence on a need-to-know basis by Tano, using the codename \"Fulcrum.\"",

        "content": "# Alliance to Restore the Republic - The early rebellion[]\n\nDue to the increased rebel activities around Lothal, the Imperial Security Bureau dispatched Agent Alexsandr Kallus to hunt down the Spectres. Kallus saw the rebel activities as part of a pattern which could lead to a spark of rebellion. The Spectres further came to the attention of Organa and recieved information from Tano as \"Fulcrum.\" After the Spectres frustrated several Imperial efforts to capture them, Grand Moff Tarkin visited Lothal and warned the Imperial officials and officers that while the various cells lacked unity, the rebels on Lothal were unique because they had unity, which made them a credible threat to the Empire. Tarkin warned that the failures of Imperial forces on Lothal allowed the Spectres to represent hope, and ordered the Grand Inquisitor to execute two of the incompetent Imperial officers. He warned the others that failure would have consequences.\n\nThe Rebellion's existence was finally revealed to the Empire when they captured Kanan Jarrus after he and the rest of the Spectres were able to hack and send out a rebellious transmission to Lothal and many surrounding systems. His capture prompted his fellow Spectres to launch a mission to rescue him from Tarkin's personal Imperial Star Destroyer, the Sovereign, over Mustafar. In order to save one of their cells and the only other Jedi involved in the movement other than herself, Tano led Phoenix Squadron to assist in their escape. Following the successful rescue, she informed the Spectres that their protocol of secrecy had changed. In response to the transmission sent by the Spectres and the rumors of the rebel action over Mustafar, anti-Imperial unrest began on Lothal and several other worlds. In response, the Emperor dispatched Darth Vader to deal with the issue.\n\nFollowing the Siege of Lothal, the Spectres were forced to retreat from Lothal and Phoenix Cell was crippled when Vader destroyed their command ship. As a result of their encounter with Vader on Lothal, the Spectres decided to permanently join Phoenix Cell. Despite the attack, the Spectres were able to recruit retired Clone Captain Rex to their cause. Phoenix Cell was also able to acquire a prototype B-wing starfighter from Mon Calamari engineer Quarrie. Working with Rex, the Spectres were able to destroy the Imperial Interdictor. The Spectres also prevented members of the Inquisitorius from capturing several Force-sensitive children.\n\nLater, Phoenix Cell suffered a major blow when the Empire learned they were hiding on the planet Garel. The Phoenix Squadron managed to escape but suffered some losses during the Battle of Garel. After Senator Organa learned of their losses, he sent his daughter Princess Leia Organa to deliver three Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes to them on Lothal. In 3 BBY, Phoenix Cell undertook a mission to seek safe passage for the Rebellion through the Concord Dawn system. After meeting resistance from Fenn Rau's Mandalorian Protectors, the Spectres managed to kidnap him and force him to meet their demands for safe passage after a second attempt.\n\nAfterward, the Spectres and Cham's Free Ryloth movement joined forces to steal a Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier above the planet Ryloth. The stolen carrier became the new flagship Phoenix Nest of Phoenix Squadron. With the help of Chopper and the former Imperial RA-7 protocol droid AP-5, Phoenix Squadron established a new base called Chopper Base on the planet Atollon.\n\nThe Imperial tactician Thrawn was promoted by the Emperor to Grand Admiral for his role in obliterating the rebel insurgency in the Batonn sector and the mastermind vigilante Nightswan. Nightswan once planned on bringing various rebel and insurgent groups together as an alliance, but, as he had recalled to Thrawn, he stopped because of paranoia, distrust, \"squabbling,\" and pride. Nightswan did not know if any individual would succeed in creating a rebel alliance, simply knowing he was not the man who could.\n\nGrand Admiral Thrawn believed the Empire was facing a galaxy-wide insurgency and studied his enemies' philosophy, art, and history in order to defeat them. In response to the activities of Phoenix Cell in the Lothal sector, Governor Arihnda Pryce enlisted his help in defeating them. Thrawn was not content with destroying Phoenix Squadron but sought to destroy the entire rebel fleet. Consequently, he allowed the squadron to escape with several stolen Y-wings during a mission to Reklam Station. These Y-wings were sent to General Jan Dodonna's unit.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Mission to Geonosis[]\n\nIn 2 BBY, Saw led a mission to investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species of the planet Geonosis. His Partisan group had become one of the many cells that would form the Rebel Alliance. Saw undertook the Geonosian mission on behalf of Rebel Command and Senator Bail Organa, an ally of the growing rebellion in the Imperial Senate. His team lost contact with Rebel Command after picking up an energy reading, which turned out to be an operational deflector shield generator.\n\nWhile exploring an underground labyrinth, Saw and his team were ambushed by Klik-Klak, the sole Geonosian to have survived the Sterilization of Geonosis. Klik-Klak's battle droids killed Saw's team but Saw managed to survive long enough for members of the Spectres rebel cell and Rex to rescue him. Saw saved the Spectres and Rex from a group of B1 battle droids and a droideka. Believing that the \"bug\" Klik-Klak was key to finding out why the Empire had exterminated the population of Geonosis, Saw convinced Rex and the Spectres to help him capture Klik-Klak.\n\nWhile exploring the central air shaft, Saw and his team discovered Klik-Klak hiding on the other side. While the Spectres Ezra Bridger and Chopper pursued the Geonosian, Saw waited with Kanan and Rex when the Spectres' leader Hera Syndulla contacted Kanan. When Hera told them to leave, Saw convinced the Spectres to delay their stay so that they could complete his original mission to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian species. Using the Force, Kanan used a stone bridge to ferry Saw and Rex safely across to the other side of the air shaft.\n\nOnce they had crossed, Saw and his rebel companions managed to corner Klik-Klak. Saw also shot out Klik Klak's remote controller with his blaster; deactivating several droidekas which were attacking the Spectres Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios above. Saw then interrogated Klik-Klak and demanded to know what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Unable to speak Galactic Basic Standard, Klik-Klak drew in the sand repeatedly. Ezra managed to befriend Klik-Klak. After Chopper picked up an energy reading, Saw forced Klik-Klak to lead them to the source.\n\nSaw and his companions soon discovered the energy reading came from Klik-Klak's nest, which served as his workshop and contained a transmitter. Still bitter about the loss of his sister Steela at the hands of the Separatists, Saw aggressively questioned Klik-Klak and rummaged through his place. Saw's aggressive methods yielded no results while Ezra's gentler methods convinced Klik-Klak to reveal that he was the custodian of the last known Geonosian queen egg. Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak off-world but Ezra objected on the grounds that Klik-Klak and the egg were among the last of their species and belonged on Geonosis. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise whereby the rebels could question Klik-Klak at Chopper Base and then return him to Geonosis.\n\nSaw, his rebel allies and their prisoner Klik-Klak rendezvoused with the Spectres' ship Ghost in the central air shaft. Once aboard, Saw exchanged pleasantries with Hera and the rest of her crew. While Kanan and Hera were preoccupied, Saw reneged on his earlier agreement and tried to take Klik-Klak off-world on the shuttle Phantom II. To force Klik-Klak's cooperation, Saw shocked him with an electro-shock device. This sparked an argument with the Spectres and Rex, who all objected to Saw's harsh methods. After fighting off Ezra and Rex, Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg. In response, Ezra and Rex urged him not to become like the Empire he was fighting against.\n\nSaw's argument with the Spectres was interrupted by the arrival of Captain Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser, which blocked the air shaft and deployed a squad of Jumptroopers to board the Ghost. Saw joined the rebels in repelling the Imperial boarders as the ship descended into the depths of Geonosis. Once at the bottom, Saw and his rebel comrades discovered several poison canisters which provided compelling evidence that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. Regretting his past behavior towards Klik-Klak, Saw argued that the Geonosians deserved the same right to rebuild as other peoples and released Klik-Klak and the Geonosian egg.\n\nAfter releasing Klik-Klak and taking several of the poison canisters, the Ghost managed to escape Geonosis by blasting through the Imperial light cruiser with proton torpedoes. Despite their successful escape, the rebels lost the poison canisters and were forced to make do with images of the canisters instead. Though Senator Organa and Commander Jun Sato regarded the mission as a success for rescuing Saw and obtaining a new deflector core, Saw was disappointed that they still had not found out what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Kanan reassured him that they would eventually find out sooner or later.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Behind the scenes[]\n\nThe character of Saw Gerrera was voiced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: The Bad Batch by Andrew Kishino. Saw Gerrera was played by Forest Whitaker in the 2016 Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, who returned to voice the character in Star Wars Rebels and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. He was originally conceived by Star Wars creator George Lucas for the unproduced live-action television series Star Wars: Underworld.\n\nAccordingly, the character's name is a \"mnemonic riff\" on real-life Argentinian revolutionary and associate of Castro - Che Guevara as revealed in The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Lucasfilm Story Group's Kiri Hart was the one who suggested that the character be used in Rogue One. Another inspiration for Gerrera's character, according to Phil Szostak, was Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz from Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now. According to writer Gary Whitta, Forest Whitaker was the only actor they considered to play Gerrera in Rogue One.\n\nWhitaker reprised his role as Gerrera in the episodes \"Narkina 5\" and \"Daughter of Ferrix\" in the Andor television series. Executive producer and writer Tony Gilroy wanted Gerrera and the other legacy characters to not provide fan service. The night before a rehearsal for Gerrera and Luthen Rael's argument in \"Narkina 5,\" Whitaker asked director Toby Haynes questions about backstory and kyber crystals. During the rehearsal, Whitaker and Rael's actor, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, read the scene for the first time and went at each other. According to Haynes, when the scene was filmed for real, Whitaker and Skarsg\u00e5rd almost deconstructed what they did in a natural and spontaneous way. They then had to completely reconstruct the scene, and it was hard to get to the same pitch. Haynes wanted to end Gerrera's rant with a very direct, face-on shot of Whitaker to build the intensity and bring the audience into the argument. To accomplish this, Haynes had Whitaker do his speech several times, telling him to \"go crazy with it.\"\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Mission to Geonosis[]\n\nIn 2 BBY, Saw led a mission to investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species of the planet Geonosis. His Partisan group had become one of the many cells that would form the Rebel Alliance. Saw undertook the Geonosian mission on behalf of Rebel Command and Senator Bail Organa, an ally of the growing rebellion in the Imperial Senate. His team lost contact with Rebel Command after picking up an energy reading, which turned out to be an operational deflector shield generator.\n\nWhile exploring an underground labyrinth, Saw and his team were ambushed by Klik-Klak, the sole Geonosian to have survived the Sterilization of Geonosis. Klik-Klak's battle droids killed Saw's team but Saw managed to survive long enough for members of the Spectres rebel cell and Rex to rescue him. Saw saved the Spectres and Rex from a group of B1 battle droids and a droideka. Believing that the \"bug\" Klik-Klak was key to finding out why the Empire had exterminated the population of Geonosis, Saw convinced Rex and the Spectres to help him capture Klik-Klak.\n\nWhile exploring the central air shaft, Saw and his team discovered Klik-Klak hiding on the other side. While the Spectres Ezra Bridger and Chopper pursued the Geonosian, Saw waited with Kanan and Rex when the Spectres' leader Hera Syndulla contacted Kanan. When Hera told them to leave, Saw convinced the Spectres to delay their stay so that they could complete his original mission to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian species. Using the Force, Kanan used a stone bridge to ferry Saw and Rex safely across to the other side of the air shaft.\n\nOnce they had crossed, Saw and his rebel companions managed to corner Klik-Klak. Saw also shot out Klik Klak's remote controller with his blaster; deactivating several droidekas which were attacking the Spectres Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios above. Saw then interrogated Klik-Klak and demanded to know what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Unable to speak Galactic Basic Standard, Klik-Klak drew in the sand repeatedly. Ezra managed to befriend Klik-Klak. After Chopper picked up an energy reading, Saw forced Klik-Klak to lead them to the source.\n\nSaw and his companions soon discovered the energy reading came from Klik-Klak's nest, which served as his workshop and contained a transmitter. Still bitter about the loss of his sister Steela at the hands of the Separatists, Saw aggressively questioned Klik-Klak and rummaged through his place. Saw's aggressive methods yielded no results while Ezra's gentler methods convinced Klik-Klak to reveal that he was the custodian of the last known Geonosian queen egg. Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak off-world but Ezra objected on the grounds that Klik-Klak and the egg were among the last of their species and belonged on Geonosis. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise whereby the rebels could question Klik-Klak at Chopper Base and then return him to Geonosis.\n\nSaw, his rebel allies and their prisoner Klik-Klak rendezvoused with the Spectres' ship Ghost in the central air shaft. Once aboard, Saw exchanged pleasantries with Hera and the rest of her crew. While Kanan and Hera were preoccupied, Saw reneged on his earlier agreement and tried to take Klik-Klak off-world on the shuttle Phantom II. To force Klik-Klak's cooperation, Saw shocked him with an electro-shock device. This sparked an argument with the Spectres and Rex, who all objected to Saw's harsh methods. After fighting off Ezra and Rex, Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg. In response, Ezra and Rex urged him not to become like the Empire he was fighting against.\n\nSaw's argument with the Spectres was interrupted by the arrival of Captain Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser, which blocked the air shaft and deployed a squad of Jumptroopers to board the Ghost. Saw joined the rebels in repelling the Imperial boarders as the ship descended into the depths of Geonosis. Once at the bottom, Saw and his rebel comrades discovered several poison canisters which provided compelling evidence that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. Regretting his past behavior towards Klik-Klak, Saw argued that the Geonosians deserved the same right to rebuild as other peoples and released Klik-Klak and the Geonosian egg.",

Prior to the film's release, it was revealed in the film's teaser trailer, which was posted on April 7, 2016. In the trailer, a shot shows a sign naming the bar as Bar Belloq in aurebesh; however, this shot did not make it into the final film where the establishment goes unnamed. Pablo Hidalgo gave the tapcafe's proper name for the first time in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book released alongside the film. Hidalgo created the name in reference to the Decraniated that can be seen inside, who had been known as \"Headless Gesihas\" during production. Hidalgo later clarified that Gesh's Tapcafe was the establishment seen in the film and provided explanation for the alternate names, also calling the building Cafe Belloq, on Twitter on September 23, 2023.\n\n",

        "content": "# Alliance to Restore the Republic - The early rebellion[]\n\nHowever, by 5 BBY, a number of rebel cells had formed, operating all across the galaxy as part of an early rebellion against growing Imperial oppression, especially in light of the Empire's continuing expansion throughout the Outer Rim. One insurgency began in the Atrivis sector, where the Liberators seized an Imperial garrison but were devastatingly defeated by the Imperial Navy soon afterwards. A rebel operative named Luthen Rael did much of the on-the-ground early work in forming a network of rebel cells, receiving funding from and working alongside Senator Mon Mothma. Mothma also established a rebel cell of her own at some point. The three principle architects of the Rebel Alliance would prove to be Mothma, Senator Bail Organa, and Partisan leader Saw Gerrera, the most extreme of the three. Organa and former Jedi Ahsoka Tano operated as part of their own resistance movement that would fall into the larger whole of an emerging alliance of rebel cells.\n\nWith the Empire beginning to take notice of Mothma's banking activities, Rael set up a rebel infiltration team under Mothma's cousin Vel Sartha to steal the quarterly payroll for the Imperial sector surrounding the planet Aldhani. Rael also reasoned such a major strike against the Empire would make the regime lash out, inspiring more people to rise up as they suffered under a sudden burst of Imperial tyranny. However, the success of the Aldhani mission effectively froze Mothma's bank accounts under new laws, thereby leaving Mothma with few ways to even out her accounts before the Empire fully investigated. In the end, the only solution before Mothma was to marry her daughter Leida off to the son of Chandrilan oligarch Davo Sculdun. If she went through with the proposal, Sculdun promised to deposit into her account, thereby covering up the missing funds she had delivered to Rael.\n\nWhile Mothma could find Rael's tactics hard to stomach, particularly his usage of the Aldhani heist to hasten the speed of Imperial oppression in the name of inspiring more people to rebel, she did reflect in her personal journal that the Rebellion she was helping to form needed to show its teeth, lest Palpatine's military crush it in its infancy. While she did have hope of a peaceful end to the conflict in the Senate, she and Bail Organa helped organize paramilitary attacks from the shadows, all while presenting themselves as principled dissenters in public. Furthermore, she knew that the galaxy's assorted rebel cells needed to unify in the name of opposing Palpatine or else each would be hunted down one by one.\n\nRael also met with Saw Gerrera of the Partisans in an effort to convince him to work alongside former Separatist Anto Kreegyr's group, arguing that the rebel cells, despite their political differences, needed to join together to become a true threat to the Empire. By the time Gerrera agreed, the Imperial Security Bureau had discovered Kreegyr's looming raid on the Spellhaus Imperial power station. Reasoning that Kreegyr's demise would make the ISB overconfident and protect Rael's agent within the ISB, Lonni Jung, the two reluctantly agreed to sacrifice Kreegyr's forces for the greater good of their war effort. Shortly afterward, the raid indeed ended in the total destruction of Kreegyr's attack party. Following the Rix Road riot, Rael also formally recruited Cassian Jeron Andor into his network. The Atrivis Resistance Group, led by Travia Chan, was also active in the Atrivis sector. After deliberation, they decided to join Mothma, becoming one of the first groups of what Mothma had begun calling \"the Alliance.\"\n\nOne rebel cell was the Spectres, which largely fought on the Imperial-controlled Outer Rim planet of Lothal. Another rebel cell was Phoenix Cell, led by Commander Jun Sato, which was a part of the larger rebel network led by Tano and Senator Organa. At that point, members of those cells were not supposed to know they were part of a larger movement known as the rebellion, so if captured, they could not give information on the other rebel cells. The cells were only provided with intelligence on a need-to-know basis by Tano, using the codename \"Fulcrum.\"\n\nDue to the increased rebel activities around Lothal, the Imperial Security Bureau dispatched Agent Alexsandr Kallus to hunt down the Spectres. Kallus saw the rebel activities as part of a pattern which could lead to a spark of rebellion. The Spectres further came to the attention of Organa and recieved information from Tano as \"Fulcrum.\" After the Spectres frustrated several Imperial efforts to capture them, Grand Moff Tarkin visited Lothal and warned the Imperial officials and officers that while the various cells lacked unity, the rebels on Lothal were unique because they had unity, which made them a credible threat to the Empire. Tarkin warned that the failures of Imperial forces on Lothal allowed the Spectres to represent hope, and ordered the Grand Inquisitor to execute two of the incompetent Imperial officers. He warned the others that failure would have consequences.\n\nThe Rebellion's existence was finally revealed to the Empire when they captured Kanan Jarrus after he and the rest of the Spectres were able to hack and send out a rebellious transmission to Lothal and many surrounding systems. His capture prompted his fellow Spectres to launch a mission to rescue him from Tarkin's personal Imperial Star Destroyer, the Sovereign, over Mustafar. In order to save one of their cells and the only other Jedi involved in the movement other than herself, Tano led Phoenix Squadron to assist in their escape. Following the successful rescue, she informed the Spectres that their protocol of secrecy had changed. In response to the transmission sent by the Spectres and the rumors of the rebel action over Mustafar, anti-Imperial unrest began on Lothal and several other worlds. In response, the Emperor dispatched Darth Vader to deal with the issue.\n\nFollowing the Siege of Lothal, the Spectres were forced to retreat from Lothal and Phoenix Cell was crippled when Vader destroyed their command ship. As a result of their encounter with Vader on Lothal, the Spectres decided to permanently join Phoenix Cell. Despite the attack, the Spectres were able to recruit retired Clone Captain Rex to their cause. Phoenix Cell was also able to acquire a prototype B-wing starfighter from Mon Calamari engineer Quarrie. Working with Rex, the Spectres were able to destroy the Imperial Interdictor. The Spectres also prevented members of the Inquisitorius from capturing several Force-sensitive children.\n\nLater, Phoenix Cell suffered a major blow when the Empire learned they were hiding on the planet Garel. The Phoenix Squadron managed to escape but suffered some losses during the Battle of Garel. After Senator Organa learned of their losses, he sent his daughter Princess Leia Organa to deliver three Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes to them on Lothal. In 3 BBY, Phoenix Cell undertook a mission to seek safe passage for the Rebellion through the Concord Dawn system. After meeting resistance from Fenn Rau's Mandalorian Protectors, the Spectres managed to kidnap him and force him to meet their demands for safe passage after a second attempt.\n\nAfterward, the Spectres and Cham's Free Ryloth movement joined forces to steal a Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier above the planet Ryloth. The stolen carrier became the new flagship Phoenix Nest of Phoenix Squadron. With the help of Chopper and the former Imperial RA-7 protocol droid AP-5, Phoenix Squadron established a new base called Chopper Base on the planet Atollon.\n\nThe Imperial tactician Thrawn was promoted by the Emperor to Grand Admiral for his role in obliterating the rebel insurgency in the Batonn sector and the mastermind vigilante Nightswan. Nightswan once planned on bringing various rebel and insurgent groups together as an alliance, but, as he had recalled to Thrawn, he stopped because of paranoia, distrust, \"squabbling,\" and pride. Nightswan did not know if any individual would succeed in creating a rebel alliance, simply knowing he was not the man who could.\n\nGrand Admiral Thrawn believed the Empire was facing a galaxy-wide insurgency and studied his enemies' philosophy, art, and history in order to defeat them. In response to the activities of Phoenix Cell in the Lothal sector, Governor Arihnda Pryce enlisted his help in defeating them. Thrawn was not content with destroying Phoenix Squadron but sought to destroy the entire rebel fleet. Consequently, he allowed the squadron to escape with several stolen Y-wings during a mission to Reklam Station. These Y-wings were sent to General Jan Dodonna's unit.\n\nThe Rebellion also received an unexpected ally in the form of Agent Kallus, a former adversary of Phoenix Cell and the Spectres. Kallus had undergone a change of heart after befriending Zeb Orrelios on the ice moon of Bahryn. Kallus became the rebel spy known as Fulcrum and informed Phoenix Cell that several TIE fighter pilot cadets at the Skystrike Academy were planning to defect. Kallus also helped the rebel Wren escape with the defecting pilots Wedge Antilles and Derek Klivian, who would later join the Alliance's Starfighter Corps.\n\nAfter Governor Gar Saxon massacred the Mandalorian Protectors, Rau finally joined the Rebellion. After the Phoenix rebels evacuated rebel sympathizers from the planet Mykapo, the rebel cell Iron Squadron joined the Rebellion. The Spectres later undertook a mission with the former and original Governor of Lpthal Ryder Azadi's rebel cell to steal Thrawn's plans for a new prototype starfighter from the Imperial Armory Complex on Lothal. During the course of their mission, the rebels were helped by Agent Kallus.\n\nLater, Rebel Command dispatched Gerrera and his Partisans on a mission to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian species. With the help of the Spectres and Geonosian survivor Klik-Klak, the rebels discovered evidence that the Empire perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. Although Organa hoped to use the information to raise awareness of Imperial atrocities and to sway more worlds to their cause, the evidence, canisters used in the genocide, was lost when the Spectres and Gerrera were forced to escape, although they did manage to take images of the canisters. As the Rebellion continued to grow, Gerrera's violent tactics continued to put him at odds with the rest of the Rebels. In time, Mothma requested an official resolution of Censure Condemning Saw Gerrera of the Partisans to separate him from their growing alliance.\n\nThrawn also embarked on an ambitious program to search for Phoenix Squadron's base by dispatching E-XD-series infiltrator droids to sweep the Outer Rim Territories for signs of rebel activity. One unit, EXD-9, discovered Chopper Base but Orrelios, Chopper, and AP-5 reprogrammed him into an improvised bomb that was sent back to its base and destroyed one of Thrawn's Star Destroyers. Despite this setback, Thrawn managed to narrow down the search for Chopper Base to 94 systems. Thrawn also later discovered that Kallus was a rebel spy and decided to use him against the Rebellion.\n\n",

In its intended role, the T-7 made short work of many armored vehicles, mechanized infantry, airspeeders, and even starships - its intense ionization being particularly deadly to aircraft, as it could shut down critical components and send them into a death spiral - the T-7 was capable of chewing through nearly anything its path. The T-7 was, however, a slow firing weapon and required a lengthy pause between shots to recharge and cool down. Further, the T-7 was resolutely unmodifiable, and could not benefit from attachments or modifications to grant faster firing speeds, improvements to its range, or grant multiple shots.\n\nDespite its deadly fire capability, the T-7 gained its notorious reputation from its use on sentient beings; a single shot from a T-7 produced an explosive blast that could atomize entire groups of lifeforms - when used on an organic being, the victim was disintegrated on the molecular level atom by atom, resulting in a slow, painful, and excruciatingly grotesque death.\n\n",

The BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber was aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal when Order 66 was issued, which caused the clone troopers onboard to turn against former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. After Tano had freed Clone Commander Rex from his inhibitor chip, the two attempted to escape the Tribunal, which had fallen into a collision course with a moon after Darth Maul, a former prisoner on the starship, destroyed its hyperdrive. Maul stole the shuttle Tano and Rex had intended to take, and the two found the starfighter in the repair bay at the last minute as enemy clones fired on them, effecting a narrow and dangerous escape.\n\nAfter the Republic was reformed into the Galactic Empire, Rex continued to utilize the Y-wing as he sought to fight back against the new regime. When he met the former clone commandos of the Bad Batch on the junk planet Bracca so that they could use the medical facilities of a wrecked Star Destroyer to remove the Batch's inhibitor chips, Rex landed the Y-wing inside the remains of another vessel. When the Bad Batch arrived, they landed their transport, the Marauder, beside the Y-wing, disembarking to follow Rex to their destination.\n\n",

However, Thrawn's spies reported the trajectory of Dodonna's forces to the Grand Admiral. After exposing Kallus as Fulcrum, Thrawn used the trajectories of Massassi Group and Kallus' Fulcrum transmission to determine the location of Chopper Base and Atollon. Thrawn's Seventh Fleet, using Interdictor cruisers blockaded the Atollon system, preventing the rebels from carrying out their attack on Lothal and almost instantly taking EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate. Trapped in the system, the rebels were forced to attack blockade using a tactic which included bombing runs which would try to break the Imperial positions. Thrawn knew about this and ordered his ships to keep to their positions. He then quickly fragmented Green Squadron as they attempted to cripple his Star Destroyers. He then counterattacked with his TIE squadrons, destroying several rebel corvettes including the Sphyrna-class corvette P2. Realizing his tactic was hopeless, Commander Sato ordered the fleet to charge the blockade, and the Star Destroyers took out a second Nebulon-B frigate and the Braha'tok-class gunship Orion almost instantly.\n\nBridger and Chopper managed to escape on the Gauntlet fighter Nightbrother after Commander Sato sacrificed his life to destroy an Imperial interdictor vessel that was blocking hyperspace jumps. Ezra appealed to Mon Mothma for help, but the rebel leader was unwilling to expose the Alliance's true strength to Thrawn. Mothma agreed that Senator Organa was right when he said that the rebels were not yet ready to enter into open warfare with the Empire. With the Rebel Alliance unwilling to help, Ezra solicited the help of Sabine's Clan Wren, who destroyed Thrawn's second interdictor cruiser. As a result, the few surviving rebel forces, under Captain Syndulla and General Dodonna, emerged from the surface taking heavy losses along the way and were able to flee to Yavin 4. Only a few ships, including the Ghost, the CR90 corvette Liberator, two Sphyrna-class corvettes P1 and P3 and an assortment of RZ-1 A-wing interceptors and Y-wings got out.\n\n",

Accessible by a three-paned hatch, the cockpit contained controls to activate the starfighter's engines and to open the gunner's turret.

However, Kalani, who was stationed on Agamar aboard a Separatist supply ship at the time with a battle droid garrison, assumed the shutdown command was nothing more than a Republic trick so he ignored it and did not relay to the droids under his command.\n\nYears later, Captain Rex, Lasat Garazeb Orrelios, Jedi Kanan Jarrus, and his Padawan Ezra Bridger arrived on Agamar, looking to find weapons and explosives for the rebellion. Kalani had his forces captured them and brought them to him so that he could play a little \"war game,\" saying that he could finally \"end\" the Clone Wars his way. Kalani held Zeb hostage while Rex, Kanan, and Ezra fought through his troops. After defeating waves of battle droids and making their way to the command center, Rex, Kanan, and Ezra ordered Kalani to surrender. Kalani refused, but Ezra convinced him that neither the Republic nor the Separatists won the war and the Republic became the Empire. When the Empire arrived on Agamar, Kalani agreed to help the rebels escape. While the droids and Zeb attacked the stormtroopers and AT-DP's, Kalani had five droids fired at Ezra and Kanan, who redirected their shots at proton bombs underneath the AT-AT's, destroying one of them in the process. The droids and the rebels made their escape in three Sheathipede-class transport shuttles, one being destroyed in the process. Kalani bid farewell to the rebels but refused to join them, believing that they had less than a 1% chance of successfully overthrowing the Empire.\n\n",

        "content": "# Torture - Leia's ordeal[]\n\nIn the rough draft of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, Darth Vader tortures Princess Leia with powerful electroshocks. In the incarnation of the second draft of A New Hope, Leia is replaced by Deak Starkiller, the brother of Luke Starkiller (who would become Luke Skywalker in later drafts). When the heroes find Deak inside his cell, there's a strange yellow glow in his eyes. In the third draft, Vader steps into Leia's cell, the door slams shut and \"her screams can barely be heard.\" The IT-O torture droid didn't appear until the fourth draft. According to actress Carrie Fisher, one discarded draft had Leia being found by Han and Luke while she was unconscious and hanging upside down in a beam in mid-air, bruised and beaten up, with yellow eyes, with the princess having been exposed to \"some form of radar torture\". However, the idea was abandoned because Chewbacca would have to carry her around \"for, like, the next fifteen minutes.\"\n\nIn the movie, the door to Leia's cell slams shut before the viewer gets see what actually happens to her. In the Star Wars Legends Star Wars radio drama from 1981, the interrogation session is vividly depicted in a psychologically intense scene which was so chilling that it prompted some complaints from a concerned listener. Here, Vader employs mind-altering drugs and subliminal suggestion in his sessions with the princess, which make Leia believe that her skin is on fire and her flesh being torn apart, causing the same reaction the real thing would.\n\nAn altered version was presented in the current Star Wars canon. In the 2015 junior novel A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy, the interrogation droid injects Leia with a truth serum inducing an inclination to talk without inhibition and to reveal withheld information, and clouding her grip on reality, making her think that her interrogator is someone from the Rebel Alliance who needs the information. The story briefly mentions physical torture as well, saying that \"the pain that lanced through her arm as the needle punctured her skin and the serum seeped into her system was unbearable\", and that \"she hadn't broken under any amount of agony\".\n\nA darker version is presented in the 2016 novel Bloodline, where Leia explains to Ransolm Casterfo that Vader tortured her for hours, while a couple of his Imperial stormtroopers watched (in the film, it's a couple of regular troopers) and thinks about how she was \"writhing on the floor and screaming for mercy that never came.\" Later, she states to Casterfo that Vader tortured her until she screamed and shook and thought she would die just from the pain alone.\n\nIn the short story \"Change of Heart,\" published in the 2017 anthology From a Certain Point of View, an Imperial Navy Trooper watches as Vader and the droid interrogate Leia about the location of the rebel base. The story describes how the trooper finds the interrogation painful to watch and how he struggles to control his emotions during the \"exhausting\" session, and how Leia is \"wrung out in a quivering heap of emotional and physical collapse\" afterward. The story also makes a reference to \"the physical torment the young princess had borne with such fierce determination, as Vader had probed her mind beneath the hungry needles of the interrogator droid.\"\n\nThe 2022 novel The Princess and the Scoundrel describes the truth serum as \"worse than any physical torture\", and states that it induced powerful hallucinations of the people Leia loved dying in front of her when she refused to talk. At the end of the session, Leia's heart heart was \"exhausted from racing, her eyes red and dry, her lungs ravaged from screaming\u2014both her mind and her body were broken, but her secrets were still kept.\" The book also briefly mentions physical torture, but does not elaborate any further; saying Vader had tortured Leia \"mentally and physically, leaving her with scars that no one could see but that she still felt.\"\n\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, Luke and Leia were not supposed to be siblings originally; Luke's sister was originally going to be a different person who was going to show up in a later episode that never came to be. Leia being Luke's sister was added to Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi \"to wrap up everything neatly\". The revelation that Leia was Luke's twin sister, and Darth Vader's daughter, made the scene from A New Hope more eerie in retrospect: J.J. Abrams, the director of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, described the scene as \"the most jaw-dropping-est\" Star Wars moment for him: \"When you think of it later, it's like, 'Oh my God, that's his daughter.' He's going to torture his own daughter. At the time, it's just scary. Then it gets just really creepy when you think about it. It's the worst. It's horrible.\"\n\n",

        "content": "# Torture - Leia's ordeal[]\n\nIn the rough draft of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, Darth Vader tortures Princess Leia with powerful electroshocks. In the incarnation of the second draft of A New Hope, Leia is replaced by Deak Starkiller, the brother of Luke Starkiller (who would become Luke Skywalker in later drafts). When the heroes find Deak inside his cell, there's a strange yellow glow in his eyes. In the third draft, Vader steps into Leia's cell, the door slams shut and \"her screams can barely be heard.\" The IT-O torture droid didn't appear until the fourth draft. According to actress Carrie Fisher, one discarded draft had Leia being found by Han and Luke while she was unconscious and hanging upside down in a beam in mid-air, bruised and beaten up, with yellow eyes, with the princess having been exposed to \"some form of radar torture\". However, the idea was abandoned because Chewbacca would have to carry her around \"for, like, the next fifteen minutes.\"\n\nIn the movie, the door to Leia's cell slams shut before the viewer gets see what actually happens to her. In the Star Wars Legends Star Wars radio drama from 1981, the interrogation session is vividly depicted in a psychologically intense scene which was so chilling that it prompted some complaints from a concerned listener. Here, Vader employs mind-altering drugs and subliminal suggestion in his sessions with the princess, which make Leia believe that her skin is on fire and her flesh being torn apart, causing the same reaction the real thing would.\n\nAn altered version was presented in the current Star Wars canon. In the 2015 junior novel A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy, the interrogation droid injects Leia with a truth serum inducing an inclination to talk without inhibition and to reveal withheld information, and clouding her grip on reality, making her think that her interrogator is someone from the Rebel Alliance who needs the information. The story briefly mentions physical torture as well, saying that \"the pain that lanced through her arm as the needle punctured her skin and the serum seeped into her system was unbearable\", and that \"she hadn't broken under any amount of agony\".\n\nA darker version is presented in the 2016 novel Bloodline, where Leia explains to Ransolm Casterfo that Vader tortured her for hours, while a couple of his Imperial stormtroopers watched (in the film, it's a couple of regular troopers) and thinks about how she was \"writhing on the floor and screaming for mercy that never came.\" Later, she states to Casterfo that Vader tortured her until she screamed and shook and thought she would die just from the pain alone.\n\nIn the short story \"Change of Heart,\" published in the 2017 anthology From a Certain Point of View, an Imperial Navy Trooper watches as Vader and the droid interrogate Leia about the location of the rebel base. The story describes how the trooper finds the interrogation painful to watch and how he struggles to control his emotions during the \"exhausting\" session, and how Leia is \"wrung out in a quivering heap of emotional and physical collapse\" afterward. The story also makes a reference to \"the physical torment the young princess had borne with such fierce determination, as Vader had probed her mind beneath the hungry needles of the interrogator droid.\"\n\nThe 2022 novel The Princess and the Scoundrel describes the truth serum as \"worse than any physical torture\", and states that it induced powerful hallucinations of the people Leia loved dying in front of her when she refused to talk. At the end of the session, Leia's heart heart was \"exhausted from racing, her eyes red and dry, her lungs ravaged from screaming\u2014both her mind and her body were broken, but her secrets were still kept.\" The book also briefly mentions physical torture, but does not elaborate any further; saying Vader had tortured Leia \"mentally and physically, leaving her with scars that no one could see but that she still felt.\"",

        "content": "# Duel of the Fates - Summary[]\n\n\"Duel of the Fates\" is mainly polyphonic and has a minor mode, a tempo of 152 bpm for most of the piece, and a duple meter with a time signature of 4/4. The composition is four minutes fourteen seconds long and is in the keys of E and G minor. The theme commences in an E minor as homophonic, maestoso in style, with the London Voices singing a chant in Sanskrit. The tempo, marked as \"allegro,\" then speeds up to 152 bpm as the strings enter with the violas playing a repeating phrase consisting of two eighth notes followed by two sixteenth notes and another eighth note. The low strings play sets of one, two, and five eighth notes with a measure of rest between each set's measure excluding the last, which has a pickup note, making the previous measure only seven eights rest. This continues for twenty measures with slight variations in the low string part.\n\nAfter the phrase has repeated for six measures, the theme's main melody comes in, played by the clarinets. This melody consists of two eighth notes followed by four quarter notes, two more eighth notes, and a final quarter note. It repeats four times, with the first two occurrences being identical and the last two varying. The end quarter note in the last repeat of the melody is tied to two whole notes and crescendos as the strings continue to play their repeating phrases. After another three measures, the harp plays a rising phrase. In the next bar, the French horns play the melody, and the trombones echo it in the background. Then the strings repeat their phrases for a few more bars, this time accompanied by the flutes, and then the London Voices return with their Sanskrit chant. Meanwhile, the trombones play the motif's main melody. This is followed by more repetition of the string phrases intermingled with accented notes and phrases from the tubas and trumpets. Then the London Voices return with the chant, and the French horns and trumpets trade out on the primary melody. The trumpets join the strings as they continue to repeat their phrases, crescendoing into a chorus chant of two eighth notes followed by a quarter rest, which repeats eight times as the trumpets play between every other phrase. As the pitch increases to a G minor, the chant switches back to its original form, and the trumpets continue to play accented notes between phrases. The brass and strings then join in playing the strings' repeating phrases in unison.\n\nThe piece becomes quiet with only the strings continuing as the pitch returns to E minor. Woodwinds come in with the theme's primary melody followed by the French horns and trumpets. The strings then start playing phrases composed of triplets. The main melody is traded between the flutes and French horns, and the orchestra grows into an instrumental version of the piece's second chant (played in a G minor). The chorus then returns singing the first chant. Between each pair of notes in the chant are the trumpets playing the string phrases and the French horns playing the theme's melody, with the trumpets playing between the first and third pairs and the French horns between the second and fourth. The second chant is then repeated, followed by the first quarter of the first chant, as the brass and strings once again join in playing the string phrases. The chant is repeated with a timpani roll in the middle. Next the entire orchestra plays the string phrases while crescendoing, followed by an upbeat trumpet part and a bongo part. The orchestra returns with the string phrases, and then the piece quiets as the strings continue their phrases and the woodwinds once again perform the melody. The Voices return with the first chant as it crescendos into the second chant. As the Voices sing the first quarter of the first chant, the trumpets play the string phrases. The timpani then plays a solo, the trumpets return with six eighth notes, the bongos roll, and the piece ends with one hit of the string phrase.\n\n",

However, mining interests were attracted to the planet by its hyperbaride deposits. In 22 BBY, the first year of the Clone Wars, Mimban was invaded by the Confederacy of Independent Systems due to its mineral wealth. The Mud Jumpers of the Grand Army of the Republic's 224th Division armed and trained the Mimbanese Liberation Army, promising them freedom once the Separatist Droid Army was repelled. The Clone Wars started Mimban's status as a constant battlefield.\n\nThe 501st Legion and the 224th Division's Mud Jumpers under Jedi General Laan Tik fought on the planet. In addition the Republic trained and assisted the Mimbanese Liberation Army in repelling the Confederacy of Independent Systems' Droid Army. In addition to the clone trooper units, Representative Jar Jar Binks was sent to interact with the Mimbanese. During the fight, General Tik was killed and the clones were forced to fall back. Representative Binks was left in command.\n\nAt the Republic camp, Captain Rex learned that the droid's deflector shield generator was three klicks away. Rex decided to contact command, mark the landing zone, and have a extraction shuttle sent to pull his men out. However, Rex then decided to take out the shield generator by himself. One of his troopers and Binks followed him. Rex then fought several battle droids, but was shot. Binks, using General Tik's lightsaber, was able to save Rex. Rex took the lightsaber away from Binks for his safety and continued on his own to destroy the deflector shield generator.

Those exceptional starships were all commissioned by the Emperor himself as a gift to his most devoted servants. Two of those worldcrafts, which had been intended to be supplied to Moff Ardus Kaine and the Emperor's personal hitman Ennix Devian, were being built in orbit of Coruscant, the capital world of the Empire.\n\nShortly after Palpatine's death at the Battle of Endor, Devian stole both unfinished worldcrafts. After sending them to two separate corners of the galaxy, he reconverted one of them into a Death Star-like battle station with the intention of creating a feint against the enemy Alliance of Free Planets, who at that time were based at Endor.\n\nThe battle station underwent construction near Endor and was guarded by a fleet of Imperial-class Star Destroyers. Its exact date of it commencing construction, however, remained a mystery, although it was closer to completion a few months after Endor.\n\nA few months after the Battle of Endor, a New Republic task force was sent to destroy the station. A similar weakness to the first Death Star had been discovered in the unfinished superstructure, and Republic starfighters made their way past the Imperial escorts, fought TIE squadrons and made a trench run to their designated target, as well as having to defend an inexperienced StarSpeeder 3000 Star Tours pilot that accidentally came into the conflict.\n\nFiring proton torpedoes into the thermal exhaust port, the fighters withdrew from the battle, leaving the station to be destroyed. Ultimately, however, its destruction acted as a Pyrrhic victory for the Rebels, as Devian used the distraction caused by the battle to steal several vessels from various shipyards owned by the New Republic.\n\n",

Rex explained to the Spectres that he and Saw had fought as allies during the Clone Wars. He also warned his fellow rebels to be worried about what Saw did not find on Geonosis. The rebels landed near the Geonosian structure that Saw had last entered before losing contact with Rebel Command.\n\nWhile exploring an underground labyrinth, Rex along with Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper found several discarded helmets belonging to Saw's team. Kanan and Chopper wanted to leave but Ezra and Rex were determined to find Saw and to complete their mission. After reaching a dead-end, the rebels were cornered by several battle droids and a droideka. Before the battle droids could finish off the rebels, Saw arrived and eliminated most of them with a grenade.\n\nAfter greeting his former comrade in arms, Rex and his fellow rebels agreed to help Saw find the lone Geonosian, who had ambushed and killed his group. Saw believed that the Geonosian held the key as to why the Empire had wiped out the entire population of Geonosis. Rex, the Spectres, and Saw eventually reached the central air shaft. After Kanan contacted Hera to warn about the operational battle droids, the rebels discovered the lone Geonosian on the other side of the shaft.\n\nWhile Ezra and Chopper pursued the Geonosian, Kanan used the Force to levitate Rex and Saw on a stone bridge over to the other side. Following a protracted pursuit, Rex and his comrades captured the Geonosian. While Saw was hostile to the Geonosian due to his animosity towards the Separatists, Ezra befriended the Geonosian, who was nicknamed \"Klik-Klak.\" While making their way to an energy reading picked up by Chopper, Rex explained that Saw was still affected by the death of his sister Steela at the hands of the Separatists.\n\nThe rebels soon discovered that the source of the energy reading was Klik-Klak's nest, which contained a working transmitter. While Rex and Chopper worked to establish contact with Hera, Saw and Ezra argued about Klik-Klak; who revealed that he was the custodian of the last Geonosian queen's egg. While Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak offworld, Ezra insisted that Klik-Klak belonged on Geonosis since he was one of the few surviving members of his species. When Saw expressed his dislike for the Geonosians, Rex reminded him that his mission was to find out what had happened to the Geonosian species. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise that involved bringing Klik-Klak to Chopper Base for interrogation and returning him to Geonosis once they had finished with him.\n\nAfter establishing contact with Hera, the rebels arranged to rendezvous with her at the central air shaft. After boarding the Ghost, Rex and the Spectres became involved in an argument with Saw over the treatment of Klik-Klak. Saw broke his agreement with Kanan and demanded that the rebels let him leave with Klik-Klak and the Geonosian egg. During the argument, Saw electrocuted Klik-Klak with an electro-shock device, which prompted Ezra to lunge at him. Rex tried to restrain Saw but the other rebel knocked him to the ground. When Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg, Rex reminded him that doing so would sully the memory of his sister.\n\nThe rebels' argument was interrupted by the arrival of an Arquitens-class command cruiser commanded by Captain Brunson. Rex and his fellow rebels and Saw joined forces to repel a boarding party of Jumptroopers. During the skirmish, Rex used the Ghost's laser cannon to blast several of the Jumptroopers. The Ghost then fled into the depths of Geonosis. There, the rebels and Saw discovered several Imperial poison canisters which the Empire had used to exterminate the Geonosians. Having found compelling evidence of the Imperial genocide, Saw experienced a change of heart and let Klik-Klak flee with the Geonosian queen egg into the depths of Geonosis.\n\nThe rebels fought their way out of the air shaft by blasting Brunson's light cruiser with proton torpedoes. They informed Senator Organa and Commander Sato about their successful rescue of Saw, their acquisition of a deflector core, and their discovery of the Imperial genocide against the Geonosians.\n\n",

When Crowder insisted that they pay first, Genoa countered by insisting on checking that it was not a \"knock-off.\" When Crowder noticed Omega and asked if she works alone, Genoa explained that she was teaching Omega the \"art of negotiation.\" Crowder offered drinks but Genoa refused, dismissing it as poison. Genoa admitted that he was impressed but secretly released a kouhun under the table.\n\nMeanwhile, Omega's fellow Clone Force 99 member Hunter sensed movement. Omega responded that Genoa was not a pirate but a liberator of ancient wonders. Genoa agreed while Hunter played a game of sabacc with a Bith, and proceeded to grab the Bith's hands before they could reach for a card. Before the kouhun could pierce Genoa's neck with its stinger, however, Hunter impaled the creature against the wall with his knife. Crowder's helmeted henchmen raised their blasters at Hunter. Crowder believed that he has the upper hand but Genoa revealed that Hunter was not her sole \"muscle.\"\n\nAt that, Wrecker, another member of Clone Force 99, made his presence known and took out several of Crowder's henchmen, triggering a gunfight. Omega jointed the gunfight and fired her energy bow at Crowder and his men, before grabbing the artifact and shooting down the hanging ceiling lamp over Chowder. Hunter requested pick-up from fellow team member Tech, who readied the Marauder away from the club. Genoa and the clones made a getaway by using smoke bombs to disorientate Crowder and his men. They escaped the cantina and fled aboard the parked Marauder.\n\n",

        "content": "# Across the Stars - Summary[]\n\nThe theme starts off with a slow, emotional part performed by the violas, which play long notes, and the harp, which plays repeating triplets. As the strings continue, a solo oboe comes in with the primary melody. After the oboe finishes half of the melody, the strings finish the other half and end the first section. Next, the strings join the harp in playing eleven sets of triplets before the violins commence with the main melody, which was played by the oboe prior to the triplets. This is backed by short flute riffs. The horns continue a short section of the melody before climaxing into an emotional and climactic part by the violins and horns. The violins then go into two descending phrases, the second higher in pitch than the first.\n\nThe piece then turns darker into F minor as the low strings repeat a ten sixteenth note riff and the low brass and woodwinds repeat a march-like phrase. The violins then come in to back the low strings. The oboe then hints at the main melody while the low voices continue their phrases, followed by a horn phrase. This is succeeded by numerous pieces of the melody played by trombones, an oboe, and the horns, each followed by two beats played by horns and trombones, and trumpets respectively, with the horns having no phrase after they play the melody. The theme then crescendos into a violin part accented by staccato and legato phrases from the low strings. Next the horns take over the melody while the low strings play more staccato notes.\n\nThe motif revisits the point toward the beginning where the horns and violins shared the melody, a half-step lower in E minor. However, this time the trumpets play small background phrases consisting of one note per phrase, excluding the last phrase. The horns and oboe then take over with the descending part the violins played earlier. The horns play the first, lower one, and the oboe plays the second, higher one. These two phrases are complemented by several ascending violin parts. The strings then crescendo leading into another run-through of the darker part of the theme. The violins drop out, followed by the tubas and low strings, which leads into the finale of the theme: a harp solo of the main theme succeeded by an English horn solo ending in a long note.\n\n",

Following a raid on an Imperial outpost that had been relaying messages to the Imperial-controlled planet Pandem Nai, Tensent joined the pilots of Hail Squadron at the Krayt Hut until past midnight and into the morning, where they compared notes on Y-wing repair. As the ragtag crew that made up the newly assembled Alphabet Squadron, namely Tensent, Lark, Yrica Quell, Kairos, and Chass na Chadic, eventually began to bond, they also began to hang out at the Krayt Hut.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Pandem Nai, which was a resounding New Republic win, a victory party was held aboard the Lodestar, with Ranjiy's Krayt Hut playing host to a group of over thirty pilots, mechanics, and specforce troops. Although some of the partygoers expected General Hera Syndulla, the Lodestar's commander, to shut the party down, a captain arrived at the Krayt Hut to deliver the news that she would be allowing the party. Syndulla eventually joined the party herself, with Tensent buying her a drink. As the party at the Krayt Hut wore on, Kairos and Chadic played sabacc and Chadic heard her music playing, learning that Lark had taken her datachips of deva pop music to play. Chadic invited Lark to stay and participate in the celebrations at the Krayt Hut, which he did.\n\nIn 5 ABY, New Republic forces, including the Lodestar, were attacked by the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, the same outfit who had failed to stop the New Republic at Pandem Nai. The Lodestar had been positioned above the planet Troithe but was attacked by squadrons of Imperial fighters, resulting in the ship being completely destroyed.\n\n",

Oga fatally shot Dhoran and fired Meeba. As she picked over her late lover's corpse, Oga lamented her habit of falling for \"the big, hairy, bad boys.\"\n\nAfter Vi Moradi began snooping around Black Spire Outpost, Oga had one of her goons, the Karkarodon, Rusko, bring Moradi to her in her hidden cantina office. Moradi confirmed that Oga's suspicions were correct and that she was with the Resistance, and explained her intent to set up a local base. Oga had no love for Moradi's Resistance; regardless, she offered some of Moradi's supplies back to her in exchange for a specific Batuu artifact. Dok-Ondar had been on the search for the artifact to no avail, and Oga, who had a buyer for the artifact, was eager to acquire it directly, avoiding paying Dok-Ondar a cut of the profits. She had previously dispatched multiple people to find the artifact, but they had fallen prey to the various traps left in the Black Spire Ruins by the Ancients. Moradi negotiated permission to use the ruins as a Resistance base, explaining that Resistance troops and pilots around Black Spire Outpost would be good for business and that when they eventually left, the ruins would be left clean and trap-free. Oga agreed to these terms and mockingly welcomed her to Black Spire Outpost.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath of the First Order arrived in Black Spire Outpost, demanding to see Oga, Oga consented to receive him in her hidden office. When Kath offered Oga the favor of the First Order in exchange for giving up Vi Moradi, who he knew as Starling, Oga reiterated what she had told Moradi: Oga cared only about Black Spire Outpost and her own interests. She then offered the First Order her own favor, and information on Starling, in exchange for the mysterious artifact.\n\nIt was Moradi who returned with the artifact, a necklace crafted of ethereal blue gems. Oga was incensed to learn that Moradi had stopped by Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, although Moradi was able to pacify the Blutopian. Oga accepted the necklace and confirmed to Moradi that Kath was searching for her specifically. Moradi hinted that Oga may have sold her out, which Oga refuted. She assured the spy that her lost cargo was to be returned to her, and dismissed her.\n\nOga was also involved in a spat with Zade Kalliday and his partner Valoss. They owed Oga credits, including years worth of docking fees. She sent the pair on a job retrieving a load of Moogyyrko sap from the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk to be refined into liquor later. In exchange, Oga would drop the substantial debt. Unfortunately, Kalliway lost both the cargo and his partner after their ship was boarded by the First Order. Returning to Black Spire Outpost empty-handed, a furious Oga impounded his ship..\n\nAs conflict between Moradi's burgeoning Resistance cell and Kath's forces escalated, Oga reached out to local scrap merchant Savi, of Savi & Son Salvage, forbidding him from interfering with either of them.\n\nShortly after Kath\u2019s defeat, Moradi would return to Oga's Cantina, and Oga invited her into her office. Off the record, Oga complimented Moradi. She understood that the First Order\u2019s presence in Black Spire Outpost was bad for the general populace and recognized Moradi's efforts in protecting them from the tyrants. Regardless, Oga stressed that she was still no friend to the Resistance, claiming that if the First Order returned offering money, friendship and respect, she would welcome them with open arms. As their talk wound down, Oga returned to Moradi the long-range comm that had been lost in Moradi's crash.

A chef working there, Loubo, attempted to intervene, but was stopped as Opress threw the waitress at him.\n\nSoon after, Jedi Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano visited the establishment and witnessed the aftermath of the events that had just transpired. Curious, the two wondered what happened. Loubo told them that confrontations of that sort often happened, and that he would give them a free meal.\n\nLater, Tano and Trace Martez met up with Martez's sister Rafa at the wharf, a part of Level 1313 on Coruscant. The two had dinner at Ronto Grill, a restaurant located in the same building as another Plop Dribble's.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Sabine Wren, Ketsu Onyo, and Chopper arrived at Havoc Outpost to deliver EG-86 into safe custody.

When it was announced and pictured for the public on February 27, 2019, Moogan Tea and Black Spire Brew were erroneously identified with their names swapped; Black Spire Brew was subsequently labelled correctly at the bar. The drink debuted for guests to purchase when the land opened in Disneyland Park on May 31 and Disney's Hollywood Studios on August 29. The menu's description reads, \"Cold Brew Joffrey's Coffee\u00ae, Honey, Falernum, Passion Fruit, and Citrus.\"\n\nThe 2020 non-canon video game expansion The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey to Batuu includes Black Spire Brew as a drink; however, Moogan Tea and Black Spire Brew each have the other's appearance. The drink can be purchased by the player's Sims at the Oga's Cantina vendor in the Black Spire Outpost neighborhood.

It served proteins in smoothie and cake form, as well as vegetation such as salads and stews, which were suitable for almost all known sentient species. Jordanna Sparkburn and Sylvestri Yarrow had several meals at the canteen during the time they spent delivering supplies to the station. In 228 BBY, they invited Jedi Master Mirro Lox and his Padawan, Amadeo Azzazzo to a meal at the canteen in order to discuss their friend Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh and the Stormwall, a barrier created by the Nihil marauders that prevented travel through hyperspace. Teeno brought the group to a private dining booth and served them rice tea, blue sprouts, stewed sweet beets, and fried pom-cakes.\n\n",

        "content": "# Porg - History[]\n\nPorgs evolved from seabirds on Ahch-To. Considered quite tasty by some species, they were sometimes hunted by the resident Lanai as well as visitors to Ahch-To. At the time of the First Order-Resistance War, when Jedi Master Luke Skywalker threw his lightsaber off a cliff, two porgs investigated the weapon. The birds nearly activated the weapon, before they were scared off by Rey. Shortly afterwards, another porg watched in curiosity from its nest as the Jedi Master spearfished from an island cliff. Rey found the porgs to be helpful to her Jedi training after she used the Force to catch one in midair in order to retrieve the lightsaber it had snatched. Finding that the porg's flock was visibly fascinated by her power, Rey promised them all \"a turn.\" While staying on Ahch-To, the Wookiee Chewbacca roasted two porgs for supper. A few of the birds stared at him before he could take a bite, but Chewbacca scared them off. When Chewbacca landed on Ahch-To, he considered porgs as a tasty treat, but found it hard to kill the winged creatures when the pack turned their sad eyes on him.\n\nUnable to acquire a patch of blue moss for their young twins, a couple of porgs snatched wiring of the same color from the Millennium Falcon, hindering repairs that were being performed by Chewbacca and R2-D2. Following the porgs to their nest, Chewbacca tried to barter the blue wiring for a blanket but was declined. Soon realizing the plight of the porgs, Chewbacca was convinced by R2 to brave strong winds in order to harvest the moss from the high tree. Grateful for his assistance, the parents returned the wiring to Chewbacca, marking his first amicable relationship with porgs.\n\nLater, at least four porgs found their way aboard the Millennium Falcon and made a nest. One of them accompanied Chewbacca during the Battle of Crait. Despite having an initial antagonism with the porgs, Chewbacca grew to like them and became their friend. These stowaways eventually managed to spread their species far from the borders of their home planet.\n\nBoarding the Millennium Falcon, General Leia Organa observed a number of the creatures roosting aboard the vessel, prompting her to ask Chewbacca when the ship had become a birdcage.\n\nAmong the porgs which resided on the Millennium Falcon were the Porg Stowaway, Puffy, and Snappy.\n\nIn 34 ABY, porgs were imported to the planet Batuu and sold as pets in the Creature Stall at Black Spire Outpost. According to author and explorer Eloc Throno, porgs were brought to Batuu when a light freighter arrived in the spacesport. Oga's Cantina served a deep orange-colored fruity beverage from Ahch-To called a Cliff Dweller in mugs carved to look like porgs.\n\nIn 35 ABY, a pair of porgs watched as Rey attempted to destroy Kylo Ren's TIE whisper and her lightsaber on Ahch-To.\n\n",

He paid ten credits for the pair's drinks, before parting with another hundred credits for information from the bartender on how to meet Nuat. Just after he paid the credits, Nuat walked in and was flanked by a pack of guards. In his custody was the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari, whom he planned to sell to the Empire. Rath Velus recognized Emari from an encounter during the Battle of Endor and offered to buy her from the crime lord while posing as an Imperial. After Nuat told Rath Velus that he had not informed the Empire that he had Emari in his possession, he ordered his guards to kill the ex-Imperial. During the ensuing chaos, Dokura was killed and Rath Velus was knocked unconscious by the bartender and taken by Nuat's thugs where he was imprisoned in one of the dungeon's cages, along with Emari.\n\nThe same night, Temmin Wexley had been brought to Nuat's office under the cantina after it had been identified he had stolen a weapon from the crime lord. After Wexley pleaded with Nuat to be freed, the youngster was taken by Nuat's Herglic enforcer Gor-kooda to the facilities cistern where Nuat intended to cut out the boy\u2019s tongue.\n\nAfter Emari escaped her cage, she freed Rath Velus and the pair looked to leave the compound. However, Rath Velus decided to save Wexley, believing he could be useful for repairs. They overpowered Gor-kooda, who had Wexley by the wrists, and made their way to the bar area, where they were quickly spotted by an Ithorian guard. A short blaster fight ensued before the trio were able to escape through the damaged side door and away from the cantina.\n\n",

By that time, the dish had become a favorite of the crime boss.\n\nWhen Garra first met the Resistance spy Vi Moradi in 34 ABY, she slurped Oga's Obsession from a glass dish, splattering Moradi's face with bits of goop. Garra explained that she controlled the outpost and did not want interference from the Resistance or its powerful enemies, the First Order. Standing close to Moradi, the crime boss used her fingers to crush the dish. Moradi did not flinch at the display despite the snack's juice stinging her eyes; afterward, she had to scrub blue slime off of her face. In his Batuu guidebook authored that year, Traveler's Guide to Batuu, the historian Eloc Throno included a photo of Oga's Obsession in a section mentioning Oga's Cantina as a place to visit on Batuu.\n\n",

        "content": "# Orman's Sky Palace - Description[]\n\nOrman's Sky Palace was located in the city of Lola Curich on the planet Lianna, not far from the Lola Curich Starport. Like most Liann buildings, the structure had no windows, with only a front door providing access for patrons, a door in the kitchen leading to the alley, and a door for the private garage beneath the building. The main area of the Sky Palace could accommodate hundreds of patrons. To the immediate right of the front door were thirty-two booths arranged in groups of four along the wall. Each group was accompanied by a faded holograph depicting one of the worlds of the Allied Tion sector including the forests of Amarin, Spinax III's seascape, pre-industrial bright skies on Lianna itself, Desargorr's mountains, a ruined fortress on Dravione, Embaril's hills and lakes, deserts and ruins on Cadinth, and Chandaar's city of Ambaril. Dozens of tables filled the middle of the floor.\n\nThe bar was the longest in the city, and was a series of long sweeping curves that could seat dozens of customers at once. It was made of polished lizard skin from Cadinth. Three bartenders staffed the bar during busy periods. The performance stage was a bright blue, and set a meter above the floor. A combination of holoprojectors, movable poles and lights, along with sound and haze generators, were present to aid performances. The bar had restrooms catering to both dominant sexes, male and female.\n\nThe private areas of Orman's Sky Palace were reserved for the staff and visiting entertainers. Orman maintained a well-appointed office on the premises, decorated in white with a desk, computer, and couch. Orman was usually on the premises during the establishments opening hours. There were three dressing rooms for the various entertainers to get ready in, and a prop room containing stage equipment. A large kitchen catered to the patrons, and included three cooks, two busboys, and two dishwashers. It was stocked with modern appliances including two reconstitution vats. Three storerooms were used to store the food and liquor. A private garage was located under the premises, with a ramp to street level. It usually contained private landspeeders belonging to the staff and a couple of scooters.\n\n",

Older Hutts, such as Aruk, would increasingly rely on their repulsorsleds as they grew increasingly corpulent. One Hutt used such a vehicle to transport himself and several slaves purchased from Clan Secura, including young Aayla Secura.\n\nThe Platoon Attack Craft was a type of hoversled, and was used by to transport battle droidsto the battlefield.\n\nSome hoversleds, often called gravsleds or grav pellets, were simple, flat vehicles used to move bulky and heavy materials; such as containers of spice in the slave-labor spice-processing plants of Nar Shaddaa prior to the Clone Wars.\n\nAmong the advantages of hoversleds over traditional sleds were that they encountered no resistance from the ground friction and could transport cargo easily, safely, and inexpensively over short distances.\n\nIn late 3 ABY, the bounty hunter Boba Fett, while attempting to deliver the carbonite-frozen Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, used a hoversled as a diversion to draw away several competing bounty hunters who were attempting to steal Solo and his accompanying reward away from Fett. The hunters were dismayed to discover that Solo's carbonite slab was not atop the hoversled, as they originally believed.\n\nSome farmers on Sulon used gravsleds for transportation around the countryside.\n\n",

The city of Farpoint was built upon the wreck of a crashed Chiss starship, and the Black Hole was located in the remains of the former bridgetower. It was partially built from storage containers, and contained mismatched furniture that accumulated over the years of ownership. In 41 ABY, the cantina was owned by Milsin, who often tried new gimmicks he picked up from watching holos from the Core, which, like all HoloNet shows and sport events on Fhost, were at least four months old. In that year, a deadly brawl broke out in the Black Hole, after Khedryn Faal won the final hand with the help of Jaden Korr in a high-stakes game of sabacc.\n\n",

Upon entering, a customer would arrive at the infrared chamber, which was a red light. This area was favored by species that could perceive the infrared, such as the Devaronians and Trandoshans. Adjacent to the west of this chamber was the yellow, arid room, designed to simulate the harsh climate of worlds such as Ryloth and Sriluur. Because of this, this chamber was frequently inhabited by Twi'leks and Weequays alike. To the east of the infrared chamber was a green room of particularly toxic gases. A second toxin room lay to the north of this, and both areas were almost entirely used by the insectoid Gand only. It was likely that the gas in these two rooms was ammonia from their home planet Gand. The fifth chamber was non-toxic and contained no harmful fumes even to Humans. It was a private lounge used by the Quarren Exchange crime lord Visquis, and thus it was locked to anybody but Visquis and his servants. In his lounge was the entrance to his secret headquarters, which contained a dimly-illuminated maze with lethal gases and a jamming system to ensure that datapad maps were rendered useless.\n\n",

Situated near a clear mountain lake, the Sheb Niktose was part of the Mandalorian settlement of Arumorut. The cantina was easily recognized by the sign that hung out front depicting a cartoonish image of an armored Mandalorian boot striking a Nikto's backside. The cantina's interior was dimly lit, with an intimate pub atmosphere frequented by local regulars. The Sheb Niktose's menu included four-credit glasses of bitter kri'gee, five-credit glasses of the clear spirit tihaar, and six-credit mugs of sweet, black ne'tra gal.\n\nDuring the civil war between the Galactic Empire and the rebel Alliance to Restore the Republic, the Sheb Niktose was staffed by a young Mandalorian bartender nicknamed \"Adiik,\" meaning \"kid\" in the Mando'a language. Teroch, a Mandalorian veteran and resident of Arumorut, could be found on occasion at the Sheb Niktose, drinking ne'tra gal with his peers. When a group of rebel operatives traveled to Vlemoth Port to seek the aid of the local Mandalorian mercenaries, they spent time at the Sheb Niktose while they waited to meet with the leader of the mercenaries, Vera Beroya. There, the rebels were invited to join Teroch at the bar, and the old Mandalorian drank several shots of tihaar with the rebel agents while discussing Arumorut's history.\n\n",

They spent an hour at the cantina in an attempt to drop a hint that the New Republic would be attacking Tangrene instead of Bilbringi. They were successful at first, as they were being followed by a Walrus-faced Aqualish spy. However, they were intercepted on their way out by Aves, a member of Talon Karrde's smuggling organization. Aves and two of his men then neutralized the freelance Imperial spy by knocking him unconscious.\n\nAves assured Antilles that the Aqualish freelancer would not be making any reports anytime soon for the Imperial Intelligence. As a result, their evening spent spreading disinformation seemed entirely wasted. In order to accomplish their objective anyway, Antilles dropped Aves a hint that the New Republic would be attacking Tangrene in twenty-eight hours, in the possibility that the smuggler would sell the information to the Empire. The Rogue Squadron pilots and the group of smugglers then parted ways, with Aves telling Antilles that any messages left with the night bartender at the Dona Laza tapcafe would reach him.\n\nFollowing the encounter, Aves and his men left the scene aboard a landspeeder, taking with them the still-unconscious Aqualish spy.\n\n",

The harvested water could be sold at a market or used by the farmers themselves in hydroponic gardens. The water was harvested using moisture vaporators, which were able to yield up to two liters of condensed water a day. However, this figure could vary dramatically depending on location. Areas of the Dune Sea, particularly near the Jundland Wastes, were known to be particularly dry. On Tatooine, moisture farmers were often vulnerable to thieves and bandits who would steal their profits.\n\nOwen Lars, like his father Cliegg Lars, was a moisture farmer on Tatooine. Ramiz was a moisture farmer on Aduba-3.\n\nTahiri Veila was born to a couple of moisture farmers on Tatooine in 13 ABY, that were descended from a Jedi of the Old Order.\n\nThe Tatooine Moisture Farm Collective often employed hunters to kill wild creatures that were known to attack moisture farmers.\n\n",

These storage facilities were placed far beneath the city's streets.\n\nThough the city was safe, it was not entirely devoid of criminal activities. Inspired by the success of the Lucky Despot Hotel and Casino, Lady Valarian established a similar venue in Mos Entha known as the Fallen Star. As with most of Lady Valarian's operations, the Fallen Star attracted a number of seedy individuals. Lady Valarian also owned a lavish town home in the city, which was heavily guarded to protect herself and her property.\n\nAfter the death of Jabba Desilijic Tiure in 4 ABY, much of Mos Eisley's traffic began to switch to Mos Entha. The switch in traffic by the traders and smugglers combined with an increased amount of tourism due to interest in the home world of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker resulted in Mos Entha becoming something of a model for the modern Tatooine city.\n\n",

Sixty ultra-modern docking facilities were grouped radially around the four domed hubs. Nearly another dozen docking bays were scattered around the edges of the city resulting in nearly 75 docking bays being available for visiting starships.\n\nThe majority of the cultural, entertainment and government establishments were contained within the spaceport domes. Each dome contained large multi-level, controlled-environment hotels that catered to the tourist trade. Also contained within the domes were many government offices, shopping centers, restaurants, museums and theaters.\n\nOutside the general area of the spaceport domes the streets of Mos Entha were much like those of other Tatooine cities. Swoops and speeders could be found darting around slower-moving traffic like dewbacks and rontos. Jawas and traders from hundreds of worlds clogged the streets.\n\n",

Ojom avoided Imperial occupation and enslavement by calling in favors with various influential underworld connections\u2014though many Besalisks spent years working off this debt, especially those foolish or desperate enough to seek aid from the Hutts.\n\nAfter his defeat during the Post-Zsinj campaign, High Admiral Treuten Teradoc fled in the Deep Core where he created his small empire. Ojom was one of the planets controlled by the warlord. Like other Deep Core systems, the Ojom system was probably abandoned after the Imperial Reunification in 12 ABY.\n\n",

Faytonni almost ended the partnership after an unsuccessful case concerning a spice mine. Med-Beq and Faytonni fled to Coruscant.\n\nEventually, the duo was imprisoned, but in 22 BBY they escaped from the CoCo Penitentiary via a laundry speeder, accompanied by another escapee, Llollulion. A detection message was sent, but the two crooks were once again active in the CoCo District. Faytonni had a sabacc party where the two could get uniforms of the Republic Judicial Forces. The two remained hidden for a time in the Outlander Club where female customers were lured away. When Zam Wesell was caught in the club, Med-Beq was mingling with the Twi'leks Lunae Minx and Ayy Vida. Med-Beq and Faytonni also became interested in the Swokes Swokes artist Oakie Dokes and asked Dokes to sponsor them in future projects. Faytonni was, as usual, very charming, but Dokes sensed danger. An advantage for both parties meant for a Swokes Swokes. Indeed, as much as \"wretches.\" How this deal ended was not known.\n\nMed-Beq also collaborated with the naive thief Magaloof. Together they snapped some business just Med-Beq lured Magaloof into a trap by convincing him to rob a jewelry store in CoCo Town. Magaloof the shop robbed empty but was restrained by Dannl Faytonni, who, disguised as Republic Officer, gave a sermon to the Leffingite. Magaloof hurried Med-Beq to inform him about the failed burglary, but Med-Beq had disappeared.\n\nWith the spoils in their possession, Faytonni and Med-Beq went forward. In 22 BBY the two were still fleeing the Senate Commandos and still wore uniforms of the Judicial Forces. Captain Dannl Faytonni and Lieutenant Med-Beq stole the J-type star skiff of Padm\u00e9 Amidala in order to escape but failed because the ship was programmed to go to the Galactic Senate upon takeoff.\n\n",

These trees supposedly held advanced forms of sentience, allowing the trees to consciously communicate and influence their surroundings. Over the years, the trees fostered different forms of life including a race called the fae. Using the fae, the trees were able to spread across the land. Eventually, the trees decided to create more diverse forms of life, suited to survive in different parts of the planet. This inevitably created an offshoot colony of fae who laid demands for resources from their original progenitors. Unable to heed the demands of this colony, war broke out between the two factions. At some point, a third faction, the newest colony of the trees, entered the war in an attempt to force peace. As a result of the war, the factions of the fae kept finding newer and better ways of extracting energy and creating weapons. This led many of the fae to extract the energy of the trees themselves, resulting in a cataclysm.\n\nThat cataclysm resulted in the trees being destroyed, and they eventually became petrified. The world was first settled by Ariana Surabat and the crew of her ship, the Ravenstar. Batuu was a prominent trade post in the time before advancements in hyperspace technology. It was used as a popular stop-off along older routes for those who headed into Wild Space. However, after new well-charted hyperspace routes were established, the planet was bypassed by most travelers. It became a port for smugglers, gamblers, and explorers who traveled from the galactic frontier further into Wild Space and a haven for those who prefer life in the shadows.\n\n",

Arriving above the planet, the Jedi encountered another starship piloted by the Chiss Ascendancy Commander Thrawn. The Chiss conversed with Skywalker and decided to join the Jedi on his mission. The pair traveled down to Batuu, finding Amidala's ship. The vessel was being investigated by Janott's smuggler comrades, who had intended to escape Batuu at that landing spot in fear of the Separatists' investigations into the thefts. Skywalker engaged with the smugglers, but Thrawn intervened, and the chief of the smugglers explained how the landing spot was normally reserved for them.\n\nAfter searching aboard Amidala's ship, Skywalker and Thrawn decided to go to Black Spire and find information regarding the senator. The pair found Janott's cantina, meeting Janott himself, showing the bartender holograms of Duja and Padm\u00e9, and offering him money for information. After Janott denied that he had seen either, the mugs on the bar exploded as a trap for Skywalker and Thrawn, releasing gas. Four armed Separatists, who had followed the pair to the cantina, then attacked them but were defeated in the skirmish. Janott had fallen unconscious in the fight. Knowing that another gunman was waiting outside the cantina, Skywalker carried one of the dead Separatists dressed in Thrawn's attire to his Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor while Thrawn followed the fifth gunman.\n\n",

When one of them, a human, asked questions, Amidala provided a cover story that she was delivering the starship to a man named Kuseph Jovi, and the human pointed her in the direction of Janott's Cantina to find the fictitious individual. The senator made her way to the cantina, where she found that Duja's body had been laid in a funeral pyre outside the cantina. Entering Janott's cantina, Amidala spoke with Janott, detailing her made-up transaction with Jovi and inquiring about Duja's fate.\n\nReturning to her ship, Amidala traveled to where she had originally intended to meet Duja in hopes of finding the handmaiden's vessel, the Possibility. After locating Duja's starship, the senator investigated the vessel and discovered that Duja had uncovered a Separatist factory on Mokivj, the one owned by Solha. Thus, Amidala decided to go to Mokivj. During her departure, the Batuu police, suspecting she was a smuggler, went after her. The police attempted to intercept the Possibility but failed to take down the vessel, which was too fast for law enforcement.\n\n",

Sometime between 2 BBY and 0 BBY, groups of Darshi, a species that traveled both Wild Space and the Unknown Regions, migrated to Batuu, claiming that they were going on a pilgrimage to the planet for some time. The Darshi built houses at Black Spire, forming a communications triad to communicate far into the Unknown Regions, and took up landing spots, discouraging many traders. At the houses, the Darshi used hibernation chambers to imprison Force-sensitive Chiss children for the Grysk Hegemony, an enemy faction of the Chiss Ascendancy who had enslaved the Darshi as a \u201cclient species.\u201d The Grysks sought to use the children and their powers to navigate the treacherous spaces of the Unknown Regions, much like the Chiss themselves did.\n\nThe Force-sensitive Chiss caused a disturbance in the Force, which Sheev Palpatine, the Galactic Emperor, sensed and located to Batuu. In response, the Emperor sent his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, who was secretly Skywalker, and Thrawn, now a Grand Admiral in the Empire's navy, to deal with the disturbance. The reunited pair traveled to Batuu aboard Thrawn's flagship, the modified Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Chimaera, traveling down to Black Spire aboard a small freighter that also belonged to Thrawn. Studying the area from above, the Grand Admiral deduced the presence of the communications triad, also becoming suspicious of the number of starships at the landing area.\n\n",

        "content": "# Batuu - The First Order and the Resistance[]\n\nTheir search led them to Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, where they questioned the shopkeeper Dok-Ondar. The Ithorian interpreted the First Order sergeant's questions as veiled threats and claimed he was nothing but a humble proprietor. The sergeant, however, had heard of Dok-Ondar's reputation as a talent in selling and acquiring valuable artifacts and thus suspected the Resistance could have reached out to him in an attempt to gain access to the lightsaber of the Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi, who had died during the Clone Wars. After enduring a lecture from Dok-Ondar on the historical account of how he acquired the lightsaber and how the First Order would need the cooperation of Black Spire Outpost denizens if they wished for a successful mission on Batuu, the sergeant and his troops left the shop, having gotten reports of Resistance activity in the nearby market.\n\nFour months after the Battle of Crait in 34 ABY, General Leia Organa sent the spy Vi Moradi and the former First Order stormtrooper Captain Archex to build a new base on Batuu. When the two journeyed to the planet, though were caught in a skirmish between two smugglers upon arrival that forced them to crash land. Their ship was ransacked by the crew of the local crime boss, Oga Garra, who controlled the outpost. Moradi took a job at Savi & Son Salvage to earn enough to buy back her stolen supplies. She met Garra, who said that if Moradi brought back a certain artifact from the ruins, Moradi could have her property back. Moradi also negotiated for Garra to allow the Resistance to use the ruins as a base. Meanwhile, the First Order was alerted to the Resistance presence on Batuu, and Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath and twenty stormtroopers were dispatched to investigate.\n\nMoradi successfully retrieved the artifact, but was pursued by the First Order and became poisoned by traps in the ruins. She was rescued by Dolin and his truffleboar Waba and brought to his grandmother Grana for healing. Moradi persuaded Dolin to join the Resistance, although it left him estranged from his grandmother. Moradi regained most of her property from Garra except her long-range comm array, which was what she needed to update General Organa on her situation. When Moradi went to town to buy one, she met and defended a Chadra-Fan named Kriki whose employer was mistreating her. Kriki also chose to join the Resistance and helped Moradi with running her errands and technological expertise in fixing up the new base in the ruins. Later on, Moradi recruited the drunken but charismatic Zade Kalliday, who helped manage the recruitment of Resistance personnel. Soon after, Moradi was picking up lunch when she witnessed stormtroopers harassing two old women for information on Moradi. When she intervened, she was taken prisoner.\n\nAfter undergoing interrogation by Kath, Moradi was rescued by her recruits. They tapped into the First Order's network and sent out a message to the Resistance, but Organa was unable to send support. By then, multiple stormtroopers had been killed, leaving only twelve, but still enough to outnumber the Resistance. The group made a plan to get the First Order to leave Batuu. Moradi pretended to get captured to keep Kath distracted while Kriki programmed the First Order ship to send a message that the Resistance was no longer a concern on Batuu, and then self-destruct. Young people from Dolin's homestead joined the cause due to the First Order killing two villagers, but they were untrained and took casualties. Archex got Kath to take him prisoner, knowing that Kath would not leave without a victory such as capturing Archex. Kriki's reprogramming was a success; when the ship blasted off, it sent the message and exploded with Kath and Archex on board. After Moradi recovered from her injuries, she met with Garra who returned her long-range comms array as a thank-you for getting rid of the First Order. Moradi notified Organa that the base was established and ready for use as a Resistance fleet waypoint.\n\nAbout two months after the establishment of the Resistance base, the First Order's 709th Legion landed on Docking Bay 9 in Black Spire Outpost. Under the command of Lieutenant Agnon, the forces of the 709th, commonly referred to as the \"Red Fury,\" searched the outpost for Resistance spies.\n\nSoon the notorious Kendoh Gang arrived in Black Spire Outpost with the intent of stealing the hilt of the Sword of Khashyun from Dok-Ondar. The group already possessed the blade and was intent on cashing in with their anonymous benefactor by assembling the completed sword. During their time there, the First Order put out an arrest warrant for Remex Io, the crew's Clawdite member. Dok-Ondar's fixer, Varg, had notified the First Order of Io's presence, and Io was confronted by stormtroopers. He fled into the market and was pursued by the troopers, resulting in the death of a nearby civilian. After losing sight of Io, the stormtroopers were informed by a local, who was actually Io using his natural shape-shifting abilities, that their target was running toward the spaceport. Varg then caught Io himself, incapacitating him and then using his own shapeshifting powers to impersonate him and join up with Kendoh Voss and Wooro at Oga's Cantina. Voss spoke with Hondo Ohnaka, a former pirate captain who ran Ohnaka Transport Solutions, about their heist, unaware Ohnaka was in league with Dok-Ondar.\n\nOhnaka eventually reported back to Dok-Ondar but was spied on by a cam droid operated by the Kendoh Gang. When Voss and Wooro moved to steal the hilt, a group of stormtroopers surrounded the would-be thieves as well as Dok-Ondar, all of whom the First Order thought had possible ties to the rise in Resistance activity in the area. When the First Order inquired about Voss' activities, the gangster knocked over a kyber statue, which deflected the blaster fire aimed at her. Voss escalated the chaos by unleashing a baby sarlacc and using the opportunity to pass Wooro the hilt. However, Wooro would give the hilt to Io, who was actually Varg. The group escaped the First Order but soon realized that they had been tricked. Wooro found Io back at the ship and realized the hilt had been stolen back. Dok-Ondar then contacted Voss via hologram, saying that he had been the anonymous benefactor and told them that their payment was a favor he did for them, which was to trick the First Order into pursuing an anonymous lead that would give them time to escape.\n\nDuring the First Order's occupation, stormtroopers frequently patrolled the outpost as they stayed alert to signs of the Resistance.\n\n",

Thrawn had followed the fifth gunman to the landing field and defeated him when the Separatist arrived at the Larkrer. After reuniting, the Chiss and Skywalker boarded the freighter and defeated two more droids that guarded the vessel. The pair then discovered the Larkrer's destinations, including Mokivj, and that some of the materials were being stolen, linking this to Janott and the smugglers.\n\nAt this time, the unconscious Janott had been taken by some smugglers into a shop, with Oenti and four Separatist thugs gathered outside the building, which had a locked door. Thrawn had learned of this and informed Skywalker, the pair traveling towards the shop. As Oenti and his men got ready to enter the building, Skywalker and Thrawn attacked them, defeating the Separatists swiftly.

As it broke out, the bartender tried to dissuade the use of blasters.\n\nAfter two of the Gran were killed in the confrontation, the brawl was put to an end by Kyle Katarn, a New Republic Jedi trainee, who killed all of the remaining Gran when they tried to attack him. Katarn took the tavern's supply of shield units before leaving.\n\n",

Staffed by a Human bartender, the tavern was a stomping ground for city residents in need of a refreshment. From the outside, the building appeared as a gray, mostly featureless structure, with three horizontal grooves and a rectangular window above a rectangular door. The door's lining was bronze in color and had several glyphs carved into it. The tavern was actually part of a building block that also included a set of apartments and the House of Max. The upper levels of the apartments could be reached via a staircase that led to a balcony patio built atop the tavern.\n\nThe tavern's interior was spartan, containing no furniture other than a wooden bar that extended from one wall and stopped short of the opposite wall. Behind the bar was an alcove with a decorative pattern that carried three personal shield charges. The walls were stone-gray, and the floor was tiled. The ceiling was also gray and had support beams that ran the length of the cantina.\n\n",

        "content": "# Batuu - Imperial intervention[]\n\nAbove Batuu, the officers aboard the Chimaera, including Commodore Karyn Faro, became aware of four Grysk transports and a pair of Grysk heavy freighters arriving. At this time, Vader and Thrawn traveled into Black Spire, discussing the presence of the Darshi and whether they were a threat. The pair entered the Janott's old cantina, approaching the bartender Nodlia, who explained how the Darshi had changed things at Black Spire. At this time, the Darshi at the cantina, under orders from the Grysks, passed around weapons in preparation for a distraction. Thrawn then received word from Faro about the transports and heavy freighters. The Darshi attacked Vader and Grand Admiral shortly after but were ultimately defeated.\n\nOne of the Grysk freighters came down to Batuu, destroying two Darshi houses of the communications triad to land and collect the Force-sensitive Chiss children. Vader had members of his personal legion approach the Grysk freighter in orbit above Batuu aboard their freighter, named the Darkhawk. The Grysk vessel noticed the Darkhawk and broke its orbit in an attempt to escape. However, Defender Squadron One, a squadron of Imperial TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighters led by Commander Vult Skerris, disabled the Grysk freighter, scattering the four Grysk transports. The Darkhawk then clamped onto the freighter, with the legion troops, led by Stormtrooper Commander Kimmund, boarding the Grysk vessel.\n\nWhile the crew of the Grysk freighter destroyed its cargo before their vessel was completely taken over, the other Grysk freighter fled Batuu and escaped into hyperspace. At the surface of Batuu, Thrawn and Vader investigated the remaining Darshi communications triad, finding ten hibernation chambers. They then went to investigate the Darshi bodies at the cantina, finding that more of their species had recovered their bodies already. After the pair learned that the Grysk had been controlling the Darshi all along, they returned to the Chimaera above Batuu. The Chimaera subsequently departed the system shortly after.\n\n",

        "content": "# Batuu - The First Order and the Resistance[]\n\nTheir search led them to Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, where they questioned the shopkeeper Dok-Ondar. The Ithorian interpreted the First Order sergeant's questions as veiled threats and claimed he was nothing but a humble proprietor. The sergeant, however, had heard of Dok-Ondar's reputation as a talent in selling and acquiring valuable artifacts and thus suspected the Resistance could have reached out to him in an attempt to gain access to the lightsaber of the Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi, who had died during the Clone Wars. After enduring a lecture from Dok-Ondar on the historical account of how he acquired the lightsaber and how the First Order would need the cooperation of Black Spire Outpost denizens if they wished for a successful mission on Batuu, the sergeant and his troops left the shop, having gotten reports of Resistance activity in the nearby market.\n\nFour months after the Battle of Crait in 34 ABY, General Leia Organa sent the spy Vi Moradi and the former First Order stormtrooper Captain Archex to build a new base on Batuu. When the two journeyed to the planet, though were caught in a skirmish between two smugglers upon arrival that forced them to crash land. Their ship was ransacked by the crew of the local crime boss, Oga Garra, who controlled the outpost. Moradi took a job at Savi & Son Salvage to earn enough to buy back her stolen supplies. She met Garra, who said that if Moradi brought back a certain artifact from the ruins, Moradi could have her property back. Moradi also negotiated for Garra to allow the Resistance to use the ruins as a base. Meanwhile, the First Order was alerted to the Resistance presence on Batuu, and Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath and twenty stormtroopers were dispatched to investigate.\n\nMoradi successfully retrieved the artifact, but was pursued by the First Order and became poisoned by traps in the ruins. She was rescued by Dolin and his truffleboar Waba and brought to his grandmother Grana for healing. Moradi persuaded Dolin to join the Resistance, although it left him estranged from his grandmother. Moradi regained most of her property from Garra except her long-range comm array, which was what she needed to update General Organa on her situation. When Moradi went to town to buy one, she met and defended a Chadra-Fan named Kriki whose employer was mistreating her. Kriki also chose to join the Resistance and helped Moradi with running her errands and technological expertise in fixing up the new base in the ruins. Later on, Moradi recruited the drunken but charismatic Zade Kalliday, who helped manage the recruitment of Resistance personnel. Soon after, Moradi was picking up lunch when she witnessed stormtroopers harassing two old women for information on Moradi. When she intervened, she was taken prisoner.\n\nAfter undergoing interrogation by Kath, Moradi was rescued by her recruits. They tapped into the First Order's network and sent out a message to the Resistance, but Organa was unable to send support. By then, multiple stormtroopers had been killed, leaving only twelve, but still enough to outnumber the Resistance. The group made a plan to get the First Order to leave Batuu. Moradi pretended to get captured to keep Kath distracted while Kriki programmed the First Order ship to send a message that the Resistance was no longer a concern on Batuu, and then self-destruct. Young people from Dolin's homestead joined the cause due to the First Order killing two villagers, but they were untrained and took casualties. Archex got Kath to take him prisoner, knowing that Kath would not leave without a victory such as capturing Archex. Kriki's reprogramming was a success; when the ship blasted off, it sent the message and exploded with Kath and Archex on board. After Moradi recovered from her injuries, she met with Garra who returned her long-range comms array as a thank-you for getting rid of the First Order. Moradi notified Organa that the base was established and ready for use as a Resistance fleet waypoint.\n\nAbout two months after the establishment of the Resistance base, the First Order's 709th Legion landed on Docking Bay 9 in Black Spire Outpost. Under the command of Lieutenant Agnon, the forces of the 709th, commonly referred to as the \"Red Fury,\" searched the outpost for Resistance spies.",

As the Federation's vessels landed throughout the city, Amidala and the handmaiden Sab\u00e9 switched places, with the queen donning a handmaiden's garb while Sab\u00e9 dressed in the royal regalia to act as a decoy. To finish the ploy, Rab\u00e9 applied Sab\u00e9's makeup while Sach\u00e9 attended to the decoy's hair in the queen's dressing room in the Theed Royal Palace. Once finished, Rab\u00e9 pulled away the cloth around Sab\u00e9's neck that had protected the royal clothing from spilt makeup.\n\nActing as queen, Sab\u00e9 ordered that they would await the Federation forces on one of the palace's balconies. Rab\u00e9 then left the dressing room to inform Amidala's head of the Royal Naboo Security Forces, Captain Quarsh Panaka, to join them on the balcony with whatever security he deemed present. Battle droids then arrived on the balcony and Rab\u00e9 and the other handmaidens were taken prisoner along with the queen.\n\nAfter the disguised Sab\u00e9 was brought before the Federation's Viceroy Nute Gunray, Rab\u00e9 and Amidala were part of a group of prisoners that were sent to be processed in Camp Four. While being escorted to the camp through the streets of Theed by a squad of B1-series battle droids, the group was rescued by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, a pair of Jedi ambassadors who had been sent by the Galactic Republic to negotiate with the federation.\n\n",

She eventually attended a prestigious school and studied a variety of arts, including sculpture, acting, impression, However, despite being a talented artist, she eventually began a forgery ring at her school, selling to unwary offworlders. When the operation was discovered, multiple students were suspected to be involved. Forced to choose a subject at school before she was kicked out, she chose music as she had not found anything unwary to do with it. When hard evidence confirmed Tonsort's involvement, she was forced to drop out of school, with the school attempting to save face and not expel a gifted student.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Tonsort did not have many options. However, in 32 BBY, Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces approached her and offered her a position as a handmaiden for recently-elected Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Panaka believed that her criminal background and many other talents could allow her to teach the new queen how to \"cheat\" and be deceitful, although Tonsort believed after meeting Amidala that Panaka had underestimated her. Tonsort agreed, swearing her loyalty and life to Amidala. When the roster of handmaidens was filled, she suggested that all the handmaidens should change their names to match Amidala's as a sign of loyalty and for the purposes of subterfuge, taking the name Rab\u00e9 and becoming Amidala's wardrobe mistress.\n\n",

Amidala and Panaka then split off with a small group of guards and used grappling hooks to assail the side of the palace in order to reach the throne room. Rab\u00e9 and the others then managed to fight their way to the throne room and upon reaching it discovered that Amidala and the others had been captured by Gunray.\n\nSab\u00e9 shouted to the viceroy and claimed to be the true queen, fooling him and causing him to send the majority of his troops after Sab\u00e9, Rab\u00e9 and the others, who retreated.

In the ensuing skirmish, Paataatus warships aimed their spectrum lasers at the ships of Thrawn's Picket Force Six. However, the Paataatus forces' spectrum lasers were configured to deal no damage, even though spectrum lasers were designed to shift their energy frequencies to maximize damage to whatever material they were targeted on. This led Thrawn to discover the Paataatus were subjugated to remnants of the Nikardun Destiny's military. Thrawn's first officer Mid Captain Ufsa'mak'ro remarked that the Paataatus were putting on a \"light show\" rather than attacking the Chiss. The Prince Militaire of the Hiveborn was in fact covertly requesting Thrawn's help to free his people from the Nikardun. In the ensuing skirmish above Nettehi, Thrawn targeted Nikardun blockade frigates effectively holding Nettehi hostage, and the Paataatus leader thanked Thrawn for his assistance.\n\nThe Watith Captain Fsir later used the tactic by having his own remotely-piloted gunboats attack his freighter during a skirmish meant to lead Thrawn to believe they were under attack by Vagaari pirates. Thrawn captured and appropriated the Watith gunboats and the Saltbarrel, which he would in turn use for a light show of his own. At the Hoxim incident, Thrawn sought to foil a scheme to draw the Ascendancy into a civil war. There, Thrawn had members of three Great Families target their family fleets' warships with \"maximum ferocity but minimal actual damage\" using the remote-controlled ships he had claimed from the treacherous Watith.\n\n",

        "content": "# Sounds from the Galactic Skylanes (Original Music from Star Wars Jedi: Survivor) - The Search for Bands[]\n\nDevelopment of the in-universe music began in the first half of 2020, as the Jedi: Survivor music team crafted the general atmosphere of Pyloon's Saloon. By September of that year, they decided they would hire a kaleidoscope of artists in an attempt to capture a wide array of styles that was very heterogenous. To determine which artists they would reach out to, Laviers asked for input from the entire game development team, including collaborators at Lucasfilm. Taking an open-minded approach to the search, this collaboration with the wider team led to a massive document filled with YouTube video links to artists and songs whose style could potentially fit with the style of the cantina, and the music team carefully analyzed the suggestions.\n\nThe exception to the vast search was The HU, who continued working with the developers following their work on Jedi: Fallen Order. In fact, their songs that appeared in Sounds from the Galactic Skylanes were written in early 2020. The music team contemplated whether to feature the tracks in the large 2020 update to Jedi: Fallen Order or not, before ultimately deciding to hang onto the tracks for the sequel. Laviers tinkered with The HU's tracks some during the development of the game, however.\n\nThe first new band that was officially brought on was TATRAN. The group was discovered by a member of the game's music team at a music show, where he met the TATRAN drummer, Dan Mayo. The larger team was quite intrigued by TATRAN's music video \"Border View,\" wherein the group's unique, groovy sound shone through.\n\nNext to be hired was the Turkish group Alt\u0131n G\u00fcn, who were initially sourced by the wider game development team. The music team was drawn to their alien blend of music styles that was, furthermore, distinct from TATRAN and The HU and fit Respawn's vision for the cantina. In order to allow for rapping and other vocals within their music, Laviers and his team worked with the band to create a novel language to perform.\n\nThe last two artists to be hired were Kaelin Ellis and Joywave. These groups were also brought to the music team's attention by their collaborators within Respawn and Lucasfilm. The music team was drawn to Ellis's more relaxed, chilled vibe, and to Joywave's accessible pop sound. Each of the five artists chosen for the album already had established followings and identities, which was important to the music team. It allowed them to help each group riff off of their established styles in a way that meshed with the other sounds and the overall atmosphere of the cantina.\n\nOf critical importance to the development team was that the music reflected the unique styles of each artist. This meant relinquishing creative control to the musicians, who largely worked autonomously. The artists even had significant creative control over their in-universe personas, album covers, and song titles. The team at Respawn still helped tweak the music to home in on details that made the music feel more authentically Star Wars, though.\n\n",

During such lengthy sessions, Rab\u00e9 provided the Queen with counsel.\n\nIn the face of impending capture by the Trade Federation, Rab\u00e9 remained calm and professional, managing to apply Sab\u00e9's makeup with a steady hand. She and the other handmaidens were generally underestimated due to their age and uniform, but preferred being underestimated in this way as it gave them an advantage. It was well known amongst her friends that she dreamt of music.\n\nRab\u00e9 tended to whistle idly when she was in thought. As the handmaidens began to learn and share skills, Rab\u00e9 taught the group how to pick locks. She was also skilled with a grappling hook. When Padm\u00e9 inquired as to where she had learned the skill, Rab\u00e9 cited her criminal past, saying that she could not forge artwork without seeing it first. When present for a conversation but out of earshot, she still understood what transpired through lip-reading and Lorrdian-trained methods of reading body language.\n\n",

Before that point, Laviers, Barton, and Haab were unsure if the diegetic music would be integrated with the orchestral soundtrack or not. The team was excited by the prospect of releasing the in-universe tracks as a separate album, as it allowed for fans to experience the atmosphere of the game in two distinct ways: the more serious orchestral soundtrack to relive story moments, and the more casual listening of Sounds from the Galactic Skylanes to enjoy a party vibe. They also saw a rare opportunity to release in-universe Star Wars music that could be enjoyed online, without needing to boot up a game.\n\n",

At some point during the Republic Era, Reckly decided to join the Opposition, a political performance troupe of Pijali natives led by Halin Azucca. For some time, the group hosted theatrical performances on Pijal that showcased its opinions on local issues while also being informative to the public. By 40 BBY, the Opposition began to protest the Governance Treaty, believing that the motion would cede irrevocable power to the Czerka Corporation, which had been exploiting the resources of Pijal and its moon for centuries.\n\nThat year, shortly after initiating several pranks to express their dissent of the treaty, members of the Opposition, including Reckly, were framed by the Pijali monarchy for several violent attacks on Czerka facilities. Due to the framing, the troupe members were forced into hiding on Pijal's moon, where they gathered evidence that the attacks blamed on the Opposition had been carried out by blackguards, a secret division of royal guards loyal to Pijal's Princess Fanry. During their mission to Pijal to investigate the Opposition, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, were attacked by blackguards while on the planet's moon. The Jedi's escape from their assailants was aided by members of the performance troupe, including Reckly.\n\nAzucca led the Jedi and her colleagues to a nearby hideout, where she explained that the Opposition had entirely peaceful intentions. The troupe leader detailed that her organization's members had been framed for the recent attacks on Czerka facilities that had been committed by blackguards. A young Opposition member corroborated Azucca's claim to the Jedi, citing their members' innocuous former professions, including Reckly's training as a drummer. Azucca later gave Jinn a file containing evidence concerning the blackguards, which Reckly had helped collect, for use in the Jedi's investigation.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Invasion and liberation[]\n\nGobi Glie was born on the planet Ryloth, the homeworld of the Twi'lek species and a member of the Galactic Republic, a democratic union that governed much of the galaxy from its capital planet of Coruscant. Ryloth was represented in the Republic's Galactic Senate by Orn Free Taa, a corrupt and self-indulgent politician disliked on his home plant for enriching himself on Coruscant at his constituents' expense. Glie was a trusted friend and ally of Cham Syndulla, a radical who opposed Taa and wanted to bring freedom to the Twi'leks of Ryloth. Glie was additionally close to Syndulla's family and was treated like an uncle by his young daughter, Hera.\n\nIn the early days of the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Ryloth attempted to maintain neutrality but became contested due to its hyperspace location. Although Ryloth was part of the Republic, the Twi'lek citizens made it known to both sides that they wanted to remain neutral and free in the war. The Confederacy did not consider the Rylothians' wishes and mounted an invasion led by Emir Wat Tambor of the Techno Union. Tambor established an orbital blockade and started a campaign of surface bombing alongside the ground invasion, targeting Twi'lek villages and farms. Though Jedi General Ima-Gun Di and his garrison were sent to aid the Twi'leks in the early stages of the battle, Taa refused to return to Ryloth, staying on the Republic capital Coruscant instead, leading Syndulla to believe that the Republic had abandoned them. With Glie, he formed the Twi'lek Resistance to combat the Separatist occupiers themselves, working alongside General Di's ground forces and Admiral Dao's fleet in orbit to fight back.\n\nWith the small Republic garrison at their side, Glie and Syndulla's Resistance attempted to defend Rylothian villages, taking in a large number of refugees as the Separatist forces closed in. They established a base at the center of a set of canyons, and soon the right flank came under attack. Tambor's blockade cut off Republic aid and supplies, and the rapidly diminishing food and water supply proved to be a major threat to the refugees. Di ordered Admiral Dao to contact the Jedi High Council for help, to no avail. The Resistance and Di's forces continued to struggle, losing power to their heavy weapons systems and being slowly forced back. At Syndulla's urging, Di had Dao reach out to the Jedi Council again, and the admiral made contact before his ship was destroyed in battle.\n\nGlie and Syndulla retreated to their base with General Di's forces as the right flank was overrun. With Dao's fleet destroyed and Tambor's blockade in full control of the space around Ryloth, Di had little communication with the Republic, and reinforcements were unavailable. Glie joined Syndulla, Di, and clone Captain Keeli to discuss their next move. Cham demanded to know what the Republic would do to help them and was dismissive when Di promised that aid would arrive eventually. Believing that they would all die by remaining put, Syndulla ordered Glie to mobilize the Twi'leks and tell them that they were evacuating their position. Before Glie could go, Keeli countered that there was no means of escape since the right flank had collapsed. Angered, Syndulla rode off on his blurrg, leaving Glie with Di and Keeli.\n\nBecause Di only had a single LAAT/i gunship, it was impossible to evacuate all the refugees. Syndulla returned to Glie and the others as they planned what to do next. Di devised a plan to destroy one of the canyon passes the Separatists had access to by reconfiguring the gunship's fuel system into a bomb. By rerouting the Separatist army through a single ravine, Di and his remaining soldiers could provide cover while the Twi'leks fled over the mountain. The Jedi Council, meanwhile, sent two Senate diplomats, Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and Representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo, to speak with King Katuunko of Toydaria about using Toydaria as a base from which a relief package could be sent to Ryloth. Despite setbacks from the Trade Federation, King Katuunko agreed to allow the Republic to send supplies to Ryloth through his world.",

Glie remarked that she was persistent, then Serin picked up an Imperial ship following them on their scanners. Gobi told her to fly low and try to lose it but, as they began their descent, Crosshair fired a sniper blast that hit one of their ship's engines. Rapidly falling into a ravine, Glie and Serin tried to ease the crash to no avail. As they got their bearings, Crosshair and a team of clones arrived to arrest them.\n\nWhile Crosshair's squad confiscated Glie's weapons and had him, Serin, and Hera arrested, an HCVw A9 turbo tank arrived at the scene, carrying Rampart, Senator Taa, and Captain Howzer. Crosshair informed Rampart and Taa that the three were caught smuggling weapons. Rampart looked to Hera and told her that her involvement was most alarming, and Taa accused Cham of plotting an uprising. Initially, Howzer protested Rampart's order to have Hera arrested alongside Gobi and Serin, but ultimately complied and led the trio aboard the tank. Crosshair noticed three of Glie's soldiers on the western ridge of the canyon, but Rampart let them live, hoping they would report to Cham. When informed of the matter, and the trio were found guilty of treason, Cham and Eleni mounted a rescue mission, attacking the tank's speeder escorts as the convoy made its way through the chasm. One of Glie's lieutenants, Lenk, broke into the tank's cockpit and cut off communications, leaving Howzer, Rampart, and Taa hostage.\n\nRampart ordered Howzer to surrender, and Cham and Eleni entered the tank. They freed Glie, Hera, and Serin, then took the Imperial hostages outside. Glie joined Serin and Lenk in surrounding the hostages while Cham, fed up with Taa, confronted his longtime enemy as he accused the Resistance of treason. Cham aimed his blaster at Taa, but Eleni stopped him from killing the senator due to Hera's presence. Suddenly, Crosshair fired a sniper shot at Taa, hitting him in the lekku, and several gunships arrived and surrounded the Twi'leks. Although Hera escaped, Glie, the Syndullas, Lenk, and Serin were charged with the attempted assassination of Senator Taa and arrested by Rampart's forces.\n\nGobi was brought to Lessu with the others, where he was held in a cell with Cham and Eleni, while others arrested for insurgency, including Lenk and Serin, were held in an adjacent cell. Rampart and Howzer came to the prison to question the Syndullas on Hera's location, but they refused to cooperate. After leaving the prison, Rampart ordered his forces to arrest anyone with ties to Cham, and he increased patrols in Lessu. Meanwhile, Hera and Chopper contacted Omega and solicited the Bad Batch for their help. The renegade clones arrived on Ryloth and worked with Hera to devise a rescue plan. Dismayed by Rampart's orders to round up all of Cham's supporters, Howzer returned to Glie and the Syndullas' cell, where he attempted to assure them that he was trying to keep Hera safe covertly and asked them where she was, but Cham again refused. Using her knowledge from Glie's recon missions, Hera helped the Batch formulate a plan to attack the Imperial refinery, which would divert forces from the capital. As Hera, Omega, Tech, and Wrecker attacked the refinery, Gobi, Cham, and Eleni heard a ruckus outside their cell, which was Hunter and Echo, who had snuck into the capital.\n\nAs they opened the cells, Gobi asked what they were doing there, and Cham questioned how he knew who they were. Glie explained that they were mercenaries, but that he did not hire them to break them out, and Hunter informed them that Hera did. As they attempted to escape via the main entrance, the group was stopped by Howzer, who told them that there was a squad outside waiting for them. Glie angrily asked why they should trust him, and Howzer said to them that he was on their side and denounced the Empire. He told them that Imperial forces had the exits blocked, and Eleni proposed they use Senator Taa's shuttle, which was kept in his private tower chamber. Howzer refused to abandon his squad but gave Glie and the others an opportunity to escape by distracting them. While they boarded Taa's shuttle and fled the capital, Howzer convinced several of his men that what they were doing was wrong, only to be arrested for treason. Glie, the Syndullas, and the other insurgents fled Ryloth, now with more incentive to lead the new resistance against the Empire.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Continued resistance[]\n\nDespite Senator Taa's promise to Syndulla that the clone armies would leave Ryloth once the battle was over, the Republic maintained an occupation on the planet. Syndulla worked alongside the clone occupation, led by clone Captain Howzer, but Glie continued to push for a completely free Ryloth and opposed the clone presence. After the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, the Republic transformed into the Galactic Empire, and Ryloth was placed under Imperial occupation. Seeing the new government as a chance to bring peace to their world, Syndulla broke with his philosophy of promoting a Ryloth free of any outside force and began working with Senator Taa. Glie, on the other hand, maintained the Twi'lek Resistance long after he and Syndulla had planned to disband it, believing that the Empire had ill intentions for Ryloth.\n\nThough Cham and his wife, Eleni, had no sympathy for the Empire, they disapproved of Glie's insurgent activities, especially as he began to involve their daughter, Hera, in them. Glie, who treated Hera like a niece, included her in his espionage, using her and her droid companion, C1-10P, also known as \"Chopper,\" to spy on Imperial facilities. Because of his continued dissent, Glie became a priority target of Imperial officials, who were intent on snuffing out the remnants of the Resistance. During the early stages of the occupation, the Empire established a doonium refinery on Ryloth, and Glie, suspicious, sent Hera and Chopper to spy on it and gather intel.\n\nThat same day, Cham and Eleni met with Senator Taa and Imperial Navy Vice Admiral Rampart at the capitol to address the Twi'leks. As a throng formed outside, Glie and his fighters joined the crowd to watch. Their presence was noted and reported by CT-9904, also known as Crosshair, an elite clone commando assigned to help root out the insurgents. Eventually, Taa, Cham, Eleni, and Rampart stepped out onto a terrace, and Taa, speaking to the crowd, praised the Empire and how their new refinery would bring prosperity to Ryloth, then urged all Twi'leks to step down from military posts and enjoy their new freedom. Glie looked around as the crowd questioned Taa's speech and shouted that they wanted to hear from Syndulla. Cham stepped forward and addressed the crowd, telling them that the war was over and concurring with Taa. Syndulla asked the people to turn over their weapons, and Glie and his fighters left as the crowd cheered.\n\nAnticipating that Cham's new policy would make Ryloth defenseless, Glie reached out to his underworld contact, a Trandoshan information broker based on Ord Mantell named Ciddarin Scaleback, to order more weapons. Gobi later joined Cham and Eleni at their home in the Tann Province, where he and Eleni spoke on a third-floor balcony overlooking Cham as a line of Twi'leks turned their weapons in. Glie told Eleni that clones should not be the ones defending Ryloth, then questioned how Cham supported it. Eleni responded that Cham knew that the people were tired of fighting and that the Twi'leks could not go on as they had been during the war, to which Glie opined that, by having them turn over their weapons, he was making them defenseless. He added that he had reached out to his underworld contact for more. Glie and Eleni suddenly heard Chopper as he and Hera were escorted into the courtyard by Captain Howzer and a squad of clones. Howzer told Cham that the two were found inside a restricted zone, but added that he would not report it as long as it did not happen again. The two had been caught while spying on the refinery, by Glie's orders.\n\nGobi and Eleni walked down to the courtyard, where Cham was in the middle of asking Hera what she had been doing. Before Hera could respond, Glie interrupted and informed Cham that he had sent her. Eleni brought Hera and Chopper inside the house, and Cham chastised Gobi for what he had done. Syndulla questioned if Glie knew the ramifications of what would have happened if Hera was caught spying, prompting Glie to ask why it would have been spying unless the Empire did not want them to see something. Syndulla told Glie that they were in a delicate situation and that he would not allow him to put Hera in the middle of it. Gobi reminded him that the clones were supposed to leave Ryloth when the war ended, then added that he was not going to stand by while more arrived. Syndulla told Glie that their Resistance was supposed to disband when the time came and asked what they had fought for if they could not accept peace, but Glie replied that, though they had been friends a long time, Cham was unwilling to see that the Empire was up to something.\n\nNot long after leaving the Syndulla residence, Glie met with one of his fighters, Serin, at a cavern base to prepare for their run to obtain the weapons shipment from Cid. Glie had planned for Hera and Chopper to join them, but Hera arrived and told Glie that she felt she should not go. Glie told her that Cham had only said that she could not do any more spying and that this was a simple supply run instead. Hera again insisted that she stay, but as he turned to board the ship Gobi added that he was going to let her fly the ship this time. Hera, an aspiring pilot, was excited at the prospect and joined Glie, asking Chopper to cover for her while she was gone. Crosshair, who was watching them from cavern walls, fired a tracking device onto Glie's ship as it took off. Gobi helped Hera with her piloting, but as they prepared to land on Ryloth's third moon, he had Serin take over, not wanting Hera to learn takeoffs and landings until she had more experience. Once they landed, they departed the ship and waited for Cid's delivery. Hera asked Glie what supplies they were there to get, and he told her they were receiving weapons. She mentioned to Gobi that they had just turned over all their weapons to the Empire, but he responded that it was not for long.\n\nA modified Omicron-class attack shuttle, the Marauder, arrived and landed on the moon. A team of mercenary clone commandos working for Cid, the Bad Batch, stepped out of the ship. The squad's leader, Hunter, asked Gobi if he was who they were sent to meet, and Tech added that they had three dozen blasters and a case of thermal detonators, which Glie asked to see. While Glie and Serin inspected the weapons, Hera walked up to the Marauder and explored its interior with Omega, a young clone who accompanied the Batch. After closing the weapons containers, Glie said that it was only a start and asked the clones to tell Cid to contact him when she had more to sell. He handed the payment over to Hunter, who told Glie that building an arsenal would attract attention and advised that he know what he was getting into. Glie responded that they did not have a choice, then called Hera to tell her that they were leaving. Gobi and Serin loaded the weapons onto their ship, then flew off alongside Hera.\n\n",

        "content": "# Niamos! - Behind the scenes[]\n\nThe cues \"Niamos! (Morlana Club Mix)\", \"Niamos! (Coruscant Lounge Mix)\", and \"Niamos! (Galaxy Mix)\" were scored by composer Nicholas Britell for the television series Andor.\n\nThe Morlana Club Mix version was the first piece Britell worked on for the show's soundtrack. The track was created for the scene in the brothel where Andor asks about his sister. While many diegetic sounds only last a few seconds during a scene, Britell created Niamos! (Morlana Club Mix) to last for an extended period of time, playing over the conversation between Andor and the brothel hostess.\n\nAfter creating the original piece, Britell suggested to the show's creator Tony Gilroy that the track could recur in other scenes, saying it could be an \"intergalactic hit\" that played in various contexts. In Andor Season 1, two other versions of the track were used, one \"cool jazz\" version titled Coruscant Lounge Mix and one \"party\" version dubbed the Galaxy Mix. The latter was used for the aerial shot of the planet Niamos. When Britell viewed the flying-over shot introducing viewers to the tropical locale, he felt the music was an obvious fit.\n\nA new version of the track was used for the Andor Season 2 episode \"Harvest\", played during the dancing scene of the wedding of Stekan Sculdun and Leida Mothma and the escape of Cassian Andor, Bix Caleen and Wilmon Paak from Mina-Rau. This version appears as in the track \"Brasso\" on the episode's soundtrack album.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Invasion and liberation[]\n\nGobi Glie was born on the planet Ryloth, the homeworld of the Twi'lek species and a member of the Galactic Republic, a democratic union that governed much of the galaxy from its capital planet of Coruscant. Ryloth was represented in the Republic's Galactic Senate by Orn Free Taa, a corrupt and self-indulgent politician disliked on his home plant for enriching himself on Coruscant at his constituents' expense. Glie was a trusted friend and ally of Cham Syndulla, a radical who opposed Taa and wanted to bring freedom to the Twi'leks of Ryloth. Glie was additionally close to Syndulla's family and was treated like an uncle by his young daughter, Hera.\n\nIn the early days of the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Ryloth attempted to maintain neutrality but became contested due to its hyperspace location. Although Ryloth was part of the Republic, the Twi'lek citizens made it known to both sides that they wanted to remain neutral and free in the war. The Confederacy did not consider the Rylothians' wishes and mounted an invasion led by Emir Wat Tambor of the Techno Union. Tambor established an orbital blockade and started a campaign of surface bombing alongside the ground invasion, targeting Twi'lek villages and farms. Though Jedi General Ima-Gun Di and his garrison were sent to aid the Twi'leks in the early stages of the battle, Taa refused to return to Ryloth, staying on the Republic capital Coruscant instead, leading Syndulla to believe that the Republic had abandoned them. With Glie, he formed the Twi'lek Resistance to combat the Separatist occupiers themselves, working alongside General Di's ground forces and Admiral Dao's fleet in orbit to fight back.\n\nWith the small Republic garrison at their side, Glie and Syndulla's Resistance attempted to defend Rylothian villages, taking in a large number of refugees as the Separatist forces closed in. They established a base at the center of a set of canyons, and soon the right flank came under attack. Tambor's blockade cut off Republic aid and supplies, and the rapidly diminishing food and water supply proved to be a major threat to the refugees. Di ordered Admiral Dao to contact the Jedi High Council for help, to no avail. The Resistance and Di's forces continued to struggle, losing power to their heavy weapons systems and being slowly forced back. At Syndulla's urging, Di had Dao reach out to the Jedi Council again, and the admiral made contact before his ship was destroyed in battle.\n\nGlie and Syndulla retreated to their base with General Di's forces as the right flank was overrun. With Dao's fleet destroyed and Tambor's blockade in full control of the space around Ryloth, Di had little communication with the Republic, and reinforcements were unavailable. Glie joined Syndulla, Di, and clone Captain Keeli to discuss their next move. Cham demanded to know what the Republic would do to help them and was dismissive when Di promised that aid would arrive eventually. Believing that they would all die by remaining put, Syndulla ordered Glie to mobilize the Twi'leks and tell them that they were evacuating their position. Before Glie could go, Keeli countered that there was no means of escape since the right flank had collapsed. Angered, Syndulla rode off on his blurrg, leaving Glie with Di and Keeli.\n\nBecause Di only had a single LAAT/i gunship, it was impossible to evacuate all the refugees. Syndulla returned to Glie and the others as they planned what to do next. Di devised a plan to destroy one of the canyon passes the Separatists had access to by reconfiguring the gunship's fuel system into a bomb. By rerouting the Separatist army through a single ravine, Di and his remaining soldiers could provide cover while the Twi'leks fled over the mountain. The Jedi Council, meanwhile, sent two Senate diplomats, Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and Representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo, to speak with King Katuunko of Toydaria about using Toydaria as a base from which a relief package could be sent to Ryloth. Despite setbacks from the Trade Federation, King Katuunko agreed to allow the Republic to send supplies to Ryloth through his world.\n\nBack on Ryloth, Glie prepared the Resistance and the Twi'lek refugees to escape, and Captain Keeli had his men set the gunship in the canyon. Di told Glie that he and his soldiers wouldn't be able to hold off the droid forces for long. He advised that Glie move his people and their families out of danger as quickly as possible. Di turned to see Syndulla speaking with one of his soldiers, and Glie told him that Cham was still angry with the Republic and felt betrayed. Di confided in Glie that Syndulla was right to feel betrayed over the Republic's unfulfilled promises and asked that he tell him how he felt. Glie agreed to do so, and the two shook hands. Syndulla then galvanized the Twi'leks to begin evacuating. Glie watched as Di walked to join his men, then ran to catch up with the fleeing Resistance.\n\nAs Glie and Syndulla led the Twi'leks over the mountain, Di held off the advancing droid armies, giving them enough time to flee. Though they fought valiantly, Di's forces were killed, and the General gave his life to allow the Twi'leks to fight another day. Glie was moved by Di's actions and vowed to remember his sacrifice. Three Republic Pelta-class frigates from the atmosphere, fulfilling Di's promise and giving them enough provisions for the next few rotations. As the Confederacy continued to spread on Ryloth, Tambor took hold of the capital city Lessu and began plundering the Twi'lek population. The invasion forced the Republic's hand, and a naval fleet led by Generals Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker was dispatched to free Ryloth. Skywalker's fleet engaged the blockade above Ryloth, crushing it and allowing Windu and Kenobi's armies to land on the planet's surface, where began a campaign to liberate Ryloth from the Separatists.\n\nIn the meantime, the Twi'lek Resistance fled to Cazne, where they established a hideout under a crashed Separatist C-9979 landing craft after a major battle. They continued to strike against the Confederate armies, but they suffered heavy casualties. Glie himself injured his arm, leaving him unable to continue fighting. Hoping to bolster his attempt to take the capital, Windu met with Syndulla in hopes of joining forces. Cham brought Windu to their hideout, where Glie showed Syndulla his injury. Syndulla joked that it was a scratch but warmly told Glie to get better because he needed him. Glie responded in Twi'leki, and Cham continued to speak with Windu.\n\nSyndulla initially refused to cooperate with Windu, believing that Senator Taa would take advantage of a victory to advance his plans for Ryloth and the possibility of a Republic occupation. However, news of a Separatist firebombing campaign made him reconsider. Windu brokered peace between Syndulla and Senator Taa, with Taa promising that there would be no occupation as long as Syndulla didn't seek his political office. Windu and Syndulla then led a strike to take the capital. With their combined forces, they took the city, arresting Tambor in the process. After the victory, a parade was held in Lessu, where Syndulla and the freedom fighters celebrated their victory.\n\n",

Later that year a more slowed down version was played during a party in the Chandrilan Embassy on Coruscant as senator Mon Mothma talked with her old friend Tay Kolma. In 4 BBY, a more faster remix of \"Niamos!\" was played by a speaker droid at the Wedding of Stekan Sculdun and Leida Mothma at the Mothma Estate on the planet Chandrila. After Sculdun and Mothma had the first dance and other guests also began dancing, the speaker droid arrived, causing many to excitedly exclaim and begin a faster-paced dance.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Continued resistance[]\n\nDespite Senator Taa's promise to Syndulla that the clone armies would leave Ryloth once the battle was over, the Republic maintained an occupation on the planet. Syndulla worked alongside the clone occupation, led by clone Captain Howzer, but Glie continued to push for a completely free Ryloth and opposed the clone presence. After the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, the Republic transformed into the Galactic Empire, and Ryloth was placed under Imperial occupation. Seeing the new government as a chance to bring peace to their world, Syndulla broke with his philosophy of promoting a Ryloth free of any outside force and began working with Senator Taa. Glie, on the other hand, maintained the Twi'lek Resistance long after he and Syndulla had planned to disband it, believing that the Empire had ill intentions for Ryloth.\n\nThough Cham and his wife, Eleni, had no sympathy for the Empire, they disapproved of Glie's insurgent activities, especially as he began to involve their daughter, Hera, in them. Glie, who treated Hera like a niece, included her in his espionage, using her and her droid companion, C1-10P, also known as \"Chopper,\" to spy on Imperial facilities. Because of his continued dissent, Glie became a priority target of Imperial officials, who were intent on snuffing out the remnants of the Resistance. During the early stages of the occupation, the Empire established a doonium refinery on Ryloth, and Glie, suspicious, sent Hera and Chopper to spy on it and gather intel.\n\nThat same day, Cham and Eleni met with Senator Taa and Imperial Navy Vice Admiral Rampart at the capitol to address the Twi'leks. As a throng formed outside, Glie and his fighters joined the crowd to watch. Their presence was noted and reported by CT-9904, also known as Crosshair, an elite clone commando assigned to help root out the insurgents. Eventually, Taa, Cham, Eleni, and Rampart stepped out onto a terrace, and Taa, speaking to the crowd, praised the Empire and how their new refinery would bring prosperity to Ryloth, then urged all Twi'leks to step down from military posts and enjoy their new freedom. Glie looked around as the crowd questioned Taa's speech and shouted that they wanted to hear from Syndulla. Cham stepped forward and addressed the crowd, telling them that the war was over and concurring with Taa. Syndulla asked the people to turn over their weapons, and Glie and his fighters left as the crowd cheered.\n\nAnticipating that Cham's new policy would make Ryloth defenseless, Glie reached out to his underworld contact, a Trandoshan information broker based on Ord Mantell named Ciddarin Scaleback, to order more weapons. Gobi later joined Cham and Eleni at their home in the Tann Province, where he and Eleni spoke on a third-floor balcony overlooking Cham as a line of Twi'leks turned their weapons in. Glie told Eleni that clones should not be the ones defending Ryloth, then questioned how Cham supported it. Eleni responded that Cham knew that the people were tired of fighting and that the Twi'leks could not go on as they had been during the war, to which Glie opined that, by having them turn over their weapons, he was making them defenseless. He added that he had reached out to his underworld contact for more. Glie and Eleni suddenly heard Chopper as he and Hera were escorted into the courtyard by Captain Howzer and a squad of clones. Howzer told Cham that the two were found inside a restricted zone, but added that he would not report it as long as it did not happen again. The two had been caught while spying on the refinery, by Glie's orders.",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Invasion and liberation[]\n\nBack on Ryloth, Glie prepared the Resistance and the Twi'lek refugees to escape, and Captain Keeli had his men set the gunship in the canyon. Di told Glie that he and his soldiers wouldn't be able to hold off the droid forces for long. He advised that Glie move his people and their families out of danger as quickly as possible. Di turned to see Syndulla speaking with one of his soldiers, and Glie told him that Cham was still angry with the Republic and felt betrayed. Di confided in Glie that Syndulla was right to feel betrayed over the Republic's unfulfilled promises and asked that he tell him how he felt. Glie agreed to do so, and the two shook hands. Syndulla then galvanized the Twi'leks to begin evacuating. Glie watched as Di walked to join his men, then ran to catch up with the fleeing Resistance.\n\nAs Glie and Syndulla led the Twi'leks over the mountain, Di held off the advancing droid armies, giving them enough time to flee. Though they fought valiantly, Di's forces were killed, and the General gave his life to allow the Twi'leks to fight another day. Glie was moved by Di's actions and vowed to remember his sacrifice. Three Republic Pelta-class frigates from the atmosphere, fulfilling Di's promise and giving them enough provisions for the next few rotations. As the Confederacy continued to spread on Ryloth, Tambor took hold of the capital city Lessu and began plundering the Twi'lek population. The invasion forced the Republic's hand, and a naval fleet led by Generals Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker was dispatched to free Ryloth. Skywalker's fleet engaged the blockade above Ryloth, crushing it and allowing Windu and Kenobi's armies to land on the planet's surface, where began a campaign to liberate Ryloth from the Separatists.\n\nIn the meantime, the Twi'lek Resistance fled to Cazne, where they established a hideout under a crashed Separatist C-9979 landing craft after a major battle. They continued to strike against the Confederate armies, but they suffered heavy casualties. Glie himself injured his arm, leaving him unable to continue fighting. Hoping to bolster his attempt to take the capital, Windu met with Syndulla in hopes of joining forces. Cham brought Windu to their hideout, where Glie showed Syndulla his injury. Syndulla joked that it was a scratch but warmly told Glie to get better because he needed him. Glie responded in Twi'leki, and Cham continued to speak with Windu.\n\nSyndulla initially refused to cooperate with Windu, believing that Senator Taa would take advantage of a victory to advance his plans for Ryloth and the possibility of a Republic occupation. However, news of a Separatist firebombing campaign made him reconsider. Windu brokered peace between Syndulla and Senator Taa, with Taa promising that there would be no occupation as long as Syndulla didn't seek his political office. Windu and Syndulla then led a strike to take the capital. With their combined forces, they took the city, arresting Tambor in the process. After the victory, a parade was held in Lessu, where Syndulla and the freedom fighters celebrated their victory.",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Continued resistance[]\n\nGobi and Eleni walked down to the courtyard, where Cham was in the middle of asking Hera what she had been doing. Before Hera could respond, Glie interrupted and informed Cham that he had sent her. Eleni brought Hera and Chopper inside the house, and Cham chastised Gobi for what he had done. Syndulla questioned if Glie knew the ramifications of what would have happened if Hera was caught spying, prompting Glie to ask why it would have been spying unless the Empire did not want them to see something. Syndulla told Glie that they were in a delicate situation and that he would not allow him to put Hera in the middle of it. Gobi reminded him that the clones were supposed to leave Ryloth when the war ended, then added that he was not going to stand by while more arrived. Syndulla told Glie that their Resistance was supposed to disband when the time came and asked what they had fought for if they could not accept peace, but Glie replied that, though they had been friends a long time, Cham was unwilling to see that the Empire was up to something.\n\nNot long after leaving the Syndulla residence, Glie met with one of his fighters, Serin, at a cavern base to prepare for their run to obtain the weapons shipment from Cid. Glie had planned for Hera and Chopper to join them, but Hera arrived and told Glie that she felt she should not go. Glie told her that Cham had only said that she could not do any more spying and that this was a simple supply run instead. Hera again insisted that she stay, but as he turned to board the ship Gobi added that he was going to let her fly the ship this time. Hera, an aspiring pilot, was excited at the prospect and joined Glie, asking Chopper to cover for her while she was gone. Crosshair, who was watching them from cavern walls, fired a tracking device onto Glie's ship as it took off. Gobi helped Hera with her piloting, but as they prepared to land on Ryloth's third moon, he had Serin take over, not wanting Hera to learn takeoffs and landings until she had more experience. Once they landed, they departed the ship and waited for Cid's delivery. Hera asked Glie what supplies they were there to get, and he told her they were receiving weapons. She mentioned to Gobi that they had just turned over all their weapons to the Empire, but he responded that it was not for long.\n\nA modified Omicron-class attack shuttle, the Marauder, arrived and landed on the moon. A team of mercenary clone commandos working for Cid, the Bad Batch, stepped out of the ship. The squad's leader, Hunter, asked Gobi if he was who they were sent to meet, and Tech added that they had three dozen blasters and a case of thermal detonators, which Glie asked to see. While Glie and Serin inspected the weapons, Hera walked up to the Marauder and explored its interior with Omega, a young clone who accompanied the Batch. After closing the weapons containers, Glie said that it was only a start and asked the clones to tell Cid to contact him when she had more to sell. He handed the payment over to Hunter, who told Glie that building an arsenal would attract attention and advised that he know what he was getting into. Glie responded that they did not have a choice, then called Hera to tell her that they were leaving. Gobi and Serin loaded the weapons onto their ship, then flew off alongside Hera.",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - A dangerous gambit[]\n\nIn the years after breaking from the Empire, Cham led the Free Ryloth Movement, a new guerrilla resistance with Gobi as one of his top fighters once again. As the Empire increased its hold on Ryloth with Senator Taa's blessing, the Free Ryloth Movement expanded in kind, establishing a network of informants, numerous hidden bases across the system, and a stockpile of supplies and necessary materials. Cham, Gobi, and the movement recruited hundreds of volunteers and led many raids on the Imperials, killing dozens of military personnel and disrupting the spice trade. Cham made an ally in Imperial Colonel Belkor Dray, who supported the Free Ryloth movement to undermine his superior officer, Moff Delian Mors, the spice-addled governor of Ryloth. Mors lived in a luxurious palace on Ryloth's largest moon, and Dray saw Syndulla's resistance as a means to replace her. The Free Ryloth Movement had little to show for its early successes and faced losses as fighting increased. Among those killed during the resistance was Eleni, whose death spurred Cham to devote himself fully to his cause, straining his relationship with Hera.\n\nIn 14 BBY, a rebel attempt to hijack an Imperial weapons shipment at Yaga Minor was foiled by Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine's chief enforcer, who led a V-wing squadron in crushing the Twi'lek insurgents who had stolen the cache. Following the incident, Cham learned from his spies that Vader, Senator Taa, and the Emperor would be traveling to Ryloth aboard Vader's flagship, the Star Destroyer Perilous. Intent on dealing a major blow to the Empire, Cham devised a plan to target the Perilous and destroy it, thus removing the two heads of the Empire and Taa alongside them. At their underground base on Ryloth's third moon, Gobi helped Cham and several of the movement's top members, Isval, Xira, and Kallon, map out their plot to attack the Perilous. They had nine days until the ship was supposed to arrive at Ryloth, and Cham coerced Belkor to divert Imperial patrol craft and flight clearances to aid them. Gobi and the others assembled a large assault force to take down the Star Destroyer consisting of repurposed Clone Wars\u2013era vulture droids, buzz droids, mines, and shield bleeders.\n\nOn the day the Perilous was to arrive at Ryloth, Gobi joined Cham at the command center of their base with Xira, Kallon, and the droid D4L1. While Gobi manned the subspace transmitter, Xira monitored data readouts, and Kallon stood by as a consulting engineer. Nine viewscreens mounted on the wall showed the outer reaches of Ryloth's system as seen from a half dozen probe droids positioned in the planet's asteroid belt. All their droid ships were hidden in the asteroid belt as well, powered down to almost zero, and a minefield had been laid out in the surrounding space. Gobi and the others waited intently for signs of the Perilous when, suddenly, Xira yelled out that a ship was coming out of hyperspace.\n\nCham ordered the mines to be activated and shield bleeders to be put on standby. He placed a hand on Gobi's shoulder and told him to be ready to transmit orders to the droid ships. Glie, shaking with excitement and tension, replied that he was more than ready and stated that they would force-feed the Imperials some fire. As the Perilous emerged from hyperspace, the ship was pelted with hundreds of mines. Xira reported that the ship was attempting to reverse, and everyone looked at the screens. Cham stated that it seemed there was little damage from the mines, but Gobi pointed out that it had only taken little damage so far. Though they had wanted the Perilous closer to the asteroid field, Cham ordered Glie to activate the shield bleeders.\n\nThe bleeders caused the Star Destroyer's shields to fluctuate, and Gobi stated that they had trapped the ship. Cham asked Kallon if the bleeders were working, and when Kallon confirmed that the Perilous' shields were down, Cham ordered Gobi to launch all droid ships. Glie sent the signal, and from the probe droids, they could see their fleet speed out from the asteroids. Cham had Kallon magnify one of the probe readings onto the Destroyer's launch bay, where they saw a contingent of V-wings pour out of it. He asked what the status of the shields was, and Kallon told him that the ship was too far out for an accurate reading. The screens, however, then showed the shield net around the Perilous flare and die out, and Gobi slammed his fist onto the table before him in excitement. They watched as the mines continued to pelt the ship, and as the vulture droids closed in and began firing, Glie eagerly watched the battle ensue. Though some of the vulture droids entered a dogfight with the Imperial V-wings, a separate group went straight for the Perilous, speeding into the ship and deploying their cargo of explosive buzz droids. Explosions rocked the Perilous, and back in the command center, Gobi smiled as he paced the floor while watching the screens. Glie then saw a reading that the ships' weapons were down and informed the others that it was defenseless, leading Cham to order Kallon to send in the second wave of vulture droids.\n\nEveryone in the command center watched silently a single V-wing depart from the rest of the Imperial contingent, and Gobi broke the silence by asking what the ship was doing. Cham recognized that Vader was helming the ship and destroyed many of the incoming vulture droids with only the Force. The vulture droids, buzz droids, and mines collided, and the Imperial V-wings formed a protective perimeter around the Perilous. Once Vader returned to the Destroyer, the burning ship began heading towards Ryloth, and Cham was contacted by a panicked Belkor, whom he forced to continue with the plan. Cham ordered the start of phase two, earning questioned looks from Glie, Xira, and Kallon, who were unaware of the plan. Upon learning of a second phase, Gobi showed excitement, but Cham stared him down until his glee faded. Gobi asked if he had said something wrong, and Cham reprimanded him, saying that what they were doing was not a game and that people were dying. Glie tried to save face and remarked that it was only Imperial people, which Cham acknowledged but again insisted to Gobi that it was no game. His skin darkening from embarrassment, Glie agreed and calmed down. At Cham's orders, several repair ships secretly filled with members of the Free Ryloth Movement descended on the Perilous, ostensibly responding to a distress signal from Belkor.\n\nLed by Isval, the parties boarded the Perilous and attached twelve explosive charges to the ship's hyperdrive and adjacent amplifiers. Realizing the ship was going to explode, Vader ordered an evacuation of Imperial forces and, after failing to capture Isval and her team, he and the Emperor fled the Perilous aboard an escape craft that crashed on Ryloth. The Perilous was destroyed above Ryloth, but the Free Ryloth Movement was unable to assassinate Vader, the Emperor, or Senator Taa, who also survived. Cham and Isval focused on locating the crashed Imperial leaders. On Ryloth, Cham led his freedom fighters in hunting the Sith Lords, but his plan was complicated by Belkor's decision to turn against him and the threat Vader and the Emperor proved to Rylothian civilians. Cham's plan ultimately failed, and he ordered a retreat of the Free Ryloth Movement, suffering numerous losses, including Isval. Despite the movement's failure, they continued their struggle and maintained steady resistance against Imperial forces.\n\n",

Glie remarked that she was persistent, then Serin picked up an Imperial ship following them on their scanners. Gobi told her to fly low and try to lose it but, as they began their descent, Crosshair fired a sniper blast that hit one of their ship's engines. Rapidly falling into a ravine, Glie and Serin tried to ease the crash to no avail. As they got their bearings, Crosshair and a team of clones arrived to arrest them.\n\nWhile Crosshair's squad confiscated Glie's weapons and had him, Serin, and Hera arrested, an HCVw A9 turbo tank arrived at the scene, carrying Rampart, Senator Taa, and Captain Howzer. Crosshair informed Rampart and Taa that the three were caught smuggling weapons. Rampart looked to Hera and told her that her involvement was most alarming, and Taa accused Cham of plotting an uprising. Initially, Howzer protested Rampart's order to have Hera arrested alongside Gobi and Serin, but ultimately complied and led the trio aboard the tank. Crosshair noticed three of Glie's soldiers on the western ridge of the canyon, but Rampart let them live, hoping they would report to Cham. When informed of the matter, and the trio were found guilty of treason, Cham and Eleni mounted a rescue mission, attacking the tank's speeder escorts as the convoy made its way through the chasm. One of Glie's lieutenants, Lenk, broke into the tank's cockpit and cut off communications, leaving Howzer, Rampart, and Taa hostage.\n\nRampart ordered Howzer to surrender, and Cham and Eleni entered the tank. They freed Glie, Hera, and Serin, then took the Imperial hostages outside. Glie joined Serin and Lenk in surrounding the hostages while Cham, fed up with Taa, confronted his longtime enemy as he accused the Resistance of treason. Cham aimed his blaster at Taa, but Eleni stopped him from killing the senator due to Hera's presence. Suddenly, Crosshair fired a sniper shot at Taa, hitting him in the lekku, and several gunships arrived and surrounded the Twi'leks. Although Hera escaped, Glie, the Syndullas, Lenk, and Serin were charged with the attempted assassination of Senator Taa and arrested by Rampart's forces.\n\nGobi was brought to Lessu with the others, where he was held in a cell with Cham and Eleni, while others arrested for insurgency, including Lenk and Serin, were held in an adjacent cell. Rampart and Howzer came to the prison to question the Syndullas on Hera's location, but they refused to cooperate. After leaving the prison, Rampart ordered his forces to arrest anyone with ties to Cham, and he increased patrols in Lessu. Meanwhile, Hera and Chopper contacted Omega and solicited the Bad Batch for their help. The renegade clones arrived on Ryloth and worked with Hera to devise a rescue plan. Dismayed by Rampart's orders to round up all of Cham's supporters, Howzer returned to Glie and the Syndullas' cell, where he attempted to assure them that he was trying to keep Hera safe covertly and asked them where she was, but Cham again refused. Using her knowledge from Glie's recon missions, Hera helped the Batch formulate a plan to attack the Imperial refinery, which would divert forces from the capital. As Hera, Omega, Tech, and Wrecker attacked the refinery, Gobi, Cham, and Eleni heard a ruckus outside their cell, which was Hunter and Echo, who had snuck into the capital.",

For decades, Glie served as Cham Syndulla's right hand, supporting his friend's political campaigns against Ryloth's corrupt Republic senator, Orn Free Taa. Glie and Syndulla became hardened soldiers during the Clone Wars, when they formed the Twi'lek Resistance to defend and liberate Ryloth from a Confederacy of Independent Systems invasion. Despite initial opposition to Republic interference, Glie and Syndulla cooperated with Republic armed forces, and Glie worked closely alongside Jedi General Ima-Gun Di. With aid from the Republic Military and Senator Taa, the resistance repelled the Confederate forces.\n\nDespite the success of Ryloth's liberation, Glie and Syndulla's relationship cooled afterward. While Syndulla attempted to broker peace with the Republic and, later, the Empire, with Taa, Glie maintained their militia, believing that Ryloth would not be truly free until all occupational forces were gone. Because of Glie's underground rebellion against the Empire, Taa and Imperial Vice Admiral Edmon Rampart conspired to have him and Syndulla arrested. When Glie and Cham's daughter Hera, whom Gobi had been employing in his espionage, were taken into Imperial custody after picking up a weapons shipment from the mercenary group the Bad Batch, the elder Syndulla was spurred back into the fight. Rampart's machinations led to Cham's arrest, but the rebels later escaped prison and fled Ryloth with help from the Bad Batch. Fugitives of the Empire and united in the name of Ryloth's liberty once more, Glie and Syndulla formed the Free Ryloth Movement.\n\nAs one of the finest warriors at Cham's side, Glie helped the Free Ryloth Movement expand its forces to combat the Empire. In one desperate bid to free Ryloth, they plotted to assassinate Emperor Sheev Palpatine, his lieutenant Darth Vader, and Senator Taa by destroying the Star Destroyer Perilous, a plan that nearly succeeded. Despite the failure of their plot, Glie and Syndulla continued their fight as a network of cells rebelling against the Empire took shape across the galaxy. Though they initially focused solely on Ryloth's freedom despite the wider rebellion, Gobi, Cham, and the Free Ryloth Movement eventually forged ties with the Spectres, a rebel group founded by Hera and part of the larger Phoenix Cell. With aid from the Spectres, Gobi and Cham pushed on, and their long struggle paid off when Ryloth was finally freed by the end of the Galactic Civil War.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Recovering the Kalikori[]\n\nIn 2 BBY, Ryloth was placed under a stronger orbital blockade by the Empire, and Captain Slavin was placed in command of combating the Free Ryloth movement. Though Slavin's attacks and strategies were clumsy, and the Twi'leks could evade capture easily, his forces managed to take control of the Tann Province and set up their headquarters in the Syndulla residence. Gobi reported to Cham that the Empire had mined the Tulara Ravine, which the rebels had previously used to lose Imperial forces in its maze.\n\nAdditionally, unknown to the Twi'leks, the Empire became better at anticipating the movement's moves due to the arrival of Grand Admiral Thrawn, a brilliant strategist who began cracking down on them. Needing support, Cham contacted the Spectres and asked Hera to deliver supplies to the resistance. While Cham and Numa were on a mission, Gobi met with Hera after she slipped past the orbital blockade. Cham and Numa were forced to retreat, however, and were chased by an Imperial convoy near the Tulara Ravine. Cham contacted Gobi for a pickup, and he, along with Hera, arrived aboard the Ghost to rescue the two. After destroying the convoy, Hera flew the Ghost close to the ground, allowing Cham and Numa to jump aboard with their blurrgs.\n\nGobi sat in the Ghost's main hold with Cham, Numa, and the Spectres when Hera entered and reunited with her father. Cham informed Hera that the Imperials had taken over the Tann Province and that they had become more swift and precise in their counterattacks. Hera asked Cham if he was able to save their family's Kalikori when he escaped their home, prompting Ezra to ask what a Kalikori was. Numa stated that the Kalikori was a totem passed down in Twi'lek families that honor their ancestors. Glie added that each parent added to the artwork to include themselves in the legacy, and Sabine remarked that it was family history as living art. Cham solemnly told Ezra that Hera would have inherited the Syndulla Kalikori, but Hera instead told her father that she was still going to and was going to take it back in honor of her mother. Cham, Gobi, Numa, and the Spectres offered to help her, and they devised a plan to have Hera and a disguised Ezra and Chopper sneak into the Tann Province by creating a diversion inside a ravine near the province.\n\nInside the ravine, the team prepared to ambush an incoming Imperial convoy by splitting into different groups around the pass; Cham, Gobi, and a pack of blurrgs on one side, Kanan and Zeb on the other, and Sabine and Numa on a cliff above them. As the patrol neared them, Zeb sent a signal to Cham, who then sent one to Numa. Glie and Cham rushed out from hiding with their blurrgs and went headfirst towards the patrol, firing at the stormtroopers and distracting them. Sabine detonated several explosives underneath the convoy, and the rest of the group joined Gobi and Cham in the fray. Amid the commotion, everyone got on a blurrg and retreated, closely followed by the patrol, giving Hera and Ezra a chance to head for the Syndulla estate on a speeder bike, where they joined Chopper, who had already snuck into the compound.\n\nGobi and Numa led the group through the ravine, and they believed to have lost the Imperials until an AT-DP walker and Imperial Troop Transport arrived and fired on them. One of the blasts hit the blurrg Kanan and Sabine were riding, and they were stranded in the open while Glie and the others rushed to cover. Cham yelled to Gobi to fire his rocket launcher, and the two rode out to where Kanan and Sabine were. Glie jumped off his blurrg and fired his rocket launcher at the ravine wall above the AT-DP, creating a rockfall that crushed several ground stormtroopers and created a temporary blockade against the transports.\n\nThe AT-DP blasted through the rock pile and continued its advance, forcing Gobi and the others to retreat again. They took refuge behind some boulders and entered a gunfight with the oncoming Imperial forces. The Imperials, however, stopped firing as they neared, and a hologram of Captain Slavin was broadcast from the AT-DP. Slavin ordered to speak with Cham and mentioned that it was about Hera. Cham demanded to know where she was, and Slavin revealed that he had captured her and Bridger. He told Cham that both would be executed unless he surrendered. Cham walked out from behind a boulder, and Gobi tried to dissuade him from surrendering and said that he was too important, but Cham argued that Hera was just as important. He told Glie that he would trade his life for hers and that she would lead in his place. Cham demanded to know from Slavin what assurance he had that Hera and Ezra would be released, but all Slavin said was that, if Cham didn't arrive by sundown, both would be terminated. Sabine sarcastically noted that the trap couldn't be more obvious, and Cham turned to the group and asked them all to use his sacrifice to free Hera and Ezra.\n\nGobi and the rest of the rebels boarded the Ghost and flew to the Syndulla home, where Slavin was waiting with Hera and Bridger. Though Cham was willing to turn himself in, Hera surprised him by revealing that Chopper had set several explosives inside their house. Hera ordered Chopper to detonate them, destroying the Syndulla's house and giving them a chance to escape aboard the Ghost. The ship flew past Thrawn's light cruiser, but the Grand Admiral refused to retaliate and instead allowed them to get away. The Ghost later landed near a gorge, where Gobi and Numa mingled with the Spectres while Cham spoke with Hera and Kanan.\n\n",

        "content": "# The Traveler - Meeting the Ronin[]\n\nTwo decades after the rebellion, the Traveler was present on the Outer Rim Territories world of Genbara. The Traveler was seated in a copse of trees that surrounded the buried nose of a crashed starship, practicing their flute. As they played, the wandering former dark lord, no longer known by any name other than the Ronin, approached upon a road that passed by the Traveler's location. The Ronin was accompanied by his astromech droid, B5-56, and he commented on the Traveler's playing, in response to the voice within his head. The Traveler responded, asking if the wanderer was headed for the nearby Osou spaceport. Though the Ronin had not intended to go to the spaceport, he resolved to share the journey with the Traveler, who hopped down from the rock to join him and the droid.\n\nAs the three of them walked, the Traveler offered to tell a story, noting the Ronin's lightsaber scabbards and attempting to get the wanderer to provide his name. He did not, and the storyteller turned to B5-56, who gave his partner's name as Master Ronin; in turn, the Traveler bowed their head in thought before introducing themself as such. The group continued along the path, with the Traveler chatting to B5-56 while the Ronin remained a step behind. Upon reaching a crossroads, they turned in the direction that led to the spaceport, followed by the astromech and the Ronin.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Aiding the Spectres[]\n\nWhile Sabine, Ezra, and Zeb got their bearings, Gobi and Numa quickly got up and shot them with stun blasts. Cham stunned Jarrus and Chopper in the cockpit, and Gobi entered the pod as he told Hera that he only needed the Spectres' help to get on board the carrier. He then handcuffed Hera to the pilot's seat before leaving the bomber and attacking the Imperial squad outside. Glie and Numa joined him and beat down two of the remaining stormtroopers. Glie narrowly missed a shot to the head from one before shooting back and killing him. Cham ordered Gobi and Numa to set their charges on the munitions racks while he went to set charges in the engine room. As the Twi'leks set the explosives, the Spectres regained consciousness and freed Hera, resolving to stop the Twi'lek rebels from destroying the ship. Zeb and Sabine set out to disarm the bombs on the munitions rack but were spotted by Glie and Numa, who fired at them. An alarm went off, and the bay doors opened to reveal five incoming stormtroopers. The rebels turned from firing at each other and fired at the Imperials. One shot from Sabine hit the door panel, closing it. With the stormtroopers no longer a threat, Gobi and Numa refocused their attention on Zeb and Sabine.\n\nEngaged in a standoff, Glie and Numa remained behind the munitions while Sabine and Zeb stood behind a corner. To end the standoff quickly, Sabine had Zeb capture a mouse droid, then rewired it and attached a stun bomb to it. Sabine navigated the droid around the corner to the munitions, and Gobi fired at it, but she drove it past him and stopped it between him and Numa. She then activated the bomb, stunning the two Twi'leks. Sabine and Zeb ran over to the two, then took their blasters and tied them down. In the carrier's command center, Hera confronted Cham and tried to persuade him to help her. Sabine played Hera's impassioned speech to Glie and Numa, who heard as Hera spoke of how Cham hadn't fought for just one village but all of Ryloth during the Clone Wars and how he could fight for the entire galaxy instead of just Ryloth against the Empire. Inspired by Hera, Gobi looked to Numa, then stood up and told Hera over Sabine's comm that he was with her. Numa did the same, and Cham relented to his daughter.\n\nHera ordered everyone to get to the cruiser's turrets to combat an incoming fleet of TIE fighters from a nearby Imperial light cruiser. Gobi took up one of the rear turrets and fired at the TIEs as they circled the carrier. They destroyed the TIE fighters and an Imperial shuttle, but their victory was brief as the TIE bombers returned from Ryloth. The bombers fired torpedoes at the carrier, and Gobi destroyed two ships as they passed him following a bombing run. Though the rebels destroyed all the bombers, one torpedo nearly hit the command center and disrupted the stabilizer, but Cham and Hera reset the carrier together. The light cruiser advanced on the carrier, and Sabine formulated a plan to destroy it. She filled a TIE bomber with explosives, then set the craft's anti-grav. Ezra used the Force to push the ship out into space, and as it floated close to the cruiser, Cham fired on it from one of the carrier's turrets. The cruiser's forward magazine exploded, and the ship fell towards Ryloth's surface in a fiery blast. Having won the Spectres the carrier and given a symbol to the people of Ryloth, the rebels returned to Phoenix Squadron, where Gobi, Cham, and Numa bade the Spectres farewell before leaving aboard their shuttle.",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Personality and traits[]\n\nGobi Glie was a male Twi'lek who stood 1.84 meters, or 6 feet, tall. As a Rutian Twi'lek, Glie's skin tone was a gradient of blue hues. During the Clone Wars and its immediate aftermath, Gobi was a slender and muscular individual, but by 3 BBY he had aged significantly and become stockier in appearance. Additionally, his face and lekku were covered in scars. Glie spoke both Galactic Basic Standard and Twi'leki.\n\nA political radical, Glie was a staunch proponent of an independent Ryloth. His decades-long opposition to outside influence on Ryloth was directed not only toward aggressive invaders such as the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Empire but the Galactic Republic as well. Unlike Cham Syndulla, who attempted to soften his ways and accept some form of occupation following the Clone Wars, Gobi distrusted outsiders and remained devoted to removing their control over the Twi'lek people. Glie believed that he and his people didn't have a choice besides fighting in order to free Ryloth. Though he had opposed the Republic, Glie held a great deal of respect for General Ima-Gun Di despite Cham's dismissal of him. Gobi respected Di for his commitment to the Twi'leks and was moved by Di's willingness to admit the Republic's failures and his sacrifice to save the rebels, which Glie vowed to remember.\n\nA close confidante of Cham Syndulla's, Gobi was his most trusted lieutenant and shared a warm friendship with him and his family. Despite Cham's attempts to broker peace with the Empire after the Clone Wars, Glie continued to lead the resistance movement, creating political tensions between the two. Glie couldn't accept Cham's collaboration with the Empire and believed that his decision to enforce a weapons ban made the Twi'leks defenseless. He shared his concerns with Eleni Syndulla and made no secret to the family his intention to continue revolting against an occupied Ryloth. Gobi treated Cham's daughter, Hera, as a niece, but his insistence on including her in his spying, flying, and black market arms dealings put him and Cham at personal odds. Though the two disagreed on what was best for Ryloth, they remained close, and Cham later endangered his relationship with the Empire to rescue Gobi and Hera from imprisonment.\n\nGlie had little sympathy for the Imperials and took satisfaction in victories against them. During the assault on the Perilous, Gobi eagerly played his part and expressed joy as the battle increasingly turned in the Free Ryloth Movement's favor. Cham chastised Glie for his desire to see the Imperials killed, but though Gobi calmed down, he remained unconcerned that the battle had casualties as long as they were the Empire's. Because he was so devoted to Ryloth's freedom, Gobi and his comrades dismissed rebellions across the galaxy unrelated to theirs, but they later changed their stance and forged an alliance with the Spectres and Phoenix Cell after being inspired by Hera's reminder of how important their struggle was beyond Ryloth.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Aiding the Spectres[]\n\nOver the following years, Glie continued to fight alongside Cham and the Free Ryloth Movement. In 12 BBY, Hera and Cham had a falling out, and the younger Syndulla left Ryloth with Chopper to become a first-rate starship pilot. Following in her parents' footsteps, she became part of the burgeoning galactic rebellion against the Empire and formed her own cell, the Spectres, who operated on Lothal before joining the much larger Phoenix Cell. Cham and his fighters remained solely focused on Ryloth and its isolated freedom despite there being a more widespread rebel movement. The aging Gobi and Cham were often joined in their missions by Numa, a younger Twi'lek who had been a child during the Separatist invasion of Ryloth during the Clone Wars. By 3 BBY, the Imperial forces at Ryloth deployed a Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier in orbit over the planet and began running bombing campaigns to root out the Twi'lek rebels. After several years of no contact with Hera, Cham was unexpectedly messaged by her. She wanted his help taking control of the cruiser-carrier above Ryloth to provide a safe base for Phoenix Squadron. Cham brought Gobi and Numa with him aboard a Nu-class shuttle to meet with his daughter and her team in deep space. Once their ship was docked, Glie, Cham, and Numa boarded Hera's CR90 corvette.\n\nHera greeted her father, but Cham instead directed his focus to one of her Spectres, Jedi Kanan Jarrus. Jarrus introduced himself and the rest of the Spectres, Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and Garazeb Orrelios. Cham introduced himself, and Sabine recognized him as the \"Liberator of Ryloth\" from her studies at the Imperial Academy. Cham then introduced Gobi and Numa as two of his finest warriors. Hera changed the subject and told everyone gathered that they should get to the briefing. At the briefing, Hera explained that she wanted to enter Ryloth space, take control of the carrier, and escape, but Cham rejected her proposal and instead wanted to destroy it using his own strategies as a symbol for the Rylothians. Hera challenged his notion and pointed out that he would have destroyed the carrier already if he had the means to do so. Jarrus interjected that they needed each other to win, and Cham looked to Gobi and Numa and nodded. They agreed to Hera's terms, but in secret Cham instructed the two that they would turn on the Spectres once they reached the carrier. Gobi and Numa brought a bag of detonators onto their TIE/sa bomber, which was docked on the Nu-class shuttle. The group planned to use the bomber to board the carrier. Joined by the Spectres and escorted by two of Phoenix Squadron's A-wing fighters, the Twi'lek rebels entered hyperspace for Ryloth.\n\nAboard the TIE Bomber, Gobi, Hera, and Chopper sat in the cockpit while Cham, Numa, and the other Spectres sat in the adjacent ordnance bay. Cham entertained Jarrus with his story of the Battle of Lessu, and an annoyed Hera shut the door between the two pods. Glie remarked that Cham had taken a liking to her Jedi, and she snidely replied that it was more the other way around. Jarrus entered the cockpit, and Hera shut the door after him, again cutting off her father. When Jarrus remarked that she and Cham were not different, the two bickered while Glie sat with Chopper. Once the shuttle left hyperspace near Ryloth, it deployed the bomber before leaving. Cham entered the cockpit and ordered Gobi to prepare for landing. Glie went to the second pod and joined Numa and the Spectres. As they had planned, the Imperial carrier sent out its fleet of bombers to Ryloth, giving the rebels a window to take control of it. Hera signaled the A-wings, which began firing at the bomber. Using the A-wings as a guise for a rebel attack, Jarrus requested emergency permission to land from the cruiser. Both of the A-wings left the system when the carrier fired at them, and Hera shakily piloted the bomber towards the carrier's hangars. She crashed the ship into the hangar, flinging everyone aboard around the cabin.\n\nWhile Sabine, Ezra, and Zeb got their bearings, Gobi and Numa quickly got up and shot them with stun blasts. Cham stunned Jarrus and Chopper in the cockpit, and Gobi entered the pod as he told Hera that he only needed the Spectres' help to get on board the carrier. He then handcuffed Hera to the pilot's seat before leaving the bomber and attacking the Imperial squad outside. Glie and Numa joined him and beat down two of the remaining stormtroopers. Glie narrowly missed a shot to the head from one before shooting back and killing him. Cham ordered Gobi and Numa to set their charges on the munitions racks while he went to set charges in the engine room. As the Twi'leks set the explosives, the Spectres regained consciousness and freed Hera, resolving to stop the Twi'lek rebels from destroying the ship. Zeb and Sabine set out to disarm the bombs on the munitions rack but were spotted by Glie and Numa, who fired at them. An alarm went off, and the bay doors opened to reveal five incoming stormtroopers. The rebels turned from firing at each other and fired at the Imperials. One shot from Sabine hit the door panel, closing it. With the stormtroopers no longer a threat, Gobi and Numa refocused their attention on Zeb and Sabine.\n\nEngaged in a standoff, Glie and Numa remained behind the munitions while Sabine and Zeb stood behind a corner. To end the standoff quickly, Sabine had Zeb capture a mouse droid, then rewired it and attached a stun bomb to it. Sabine navigated the droid around the corner to the munitions, and Gobi fired at it, but she drove it past him and stopped it between him and Numa. She then activated the bomb, stunning the two Twi'leks. Sabine and Zeb ran over to the two, then took their blasters and tied them down. In the carrier's command center, Hera confronted Cham and tried to persuade him to help her. Sabine played Hera's impassioned speech to Glie and Numa, who heard as Hera spoke of how Cham hadn't fought for just one village but all of Ryloth during the Clone Wars and how he could fight for the entire galaxy instead of just Ryloth against the Empire. Inspired by Hera, Gobi looked to Numa, then stood up and told Hera over Sabine's comm that he was with her. Numa did the same, and Cham relented to his daughter.\n\nHera ordered everyone to get to the cruiser's turrets to combat an incoming fleet of TIE fighters from a nearby Imperial light cruiser. Gobi took up one of the rear turrets and fired at the TIEs as they circled the carrier. They destroyed the TIE fighters and an Imperial shuttle, but their victory was brief as the TIE bombers returned from Ryloth. The bombers fired torpedoes at the carrier, and Gobi destroyed two ships as they passed him following a bombing run. Though the rebels destroyed all the bombers, one torpedo nearly hit the command center and disrupted the stabilizer, but Cham and Hera reset the carrier together. The light cruiser advanced on the carrier, and Sabine formulated a plan to destroy it. She filled a TIE bomber with explosives, then set the craft's anti-grav. Ezra used the Force to push the ship out into space, and as it floated close to the cruiser, Cham fired on it from one of the carrier's turrets. The cruiser's forward magazine exploded, and the ship fell towards Ryloth's surface in a fiery blast. Having won the Spectres the carrier and given a symbol to the people of Ryloth, the rebels returned to Phoenix Squadron, where Gobi, Cham, and Numa bade the Spectres farewell before leaving aboard their shuttle.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - Recovering the Kalikori[]\n\nIn 2 BBY, Ryloth was placed under a stronger orbital blockade by the Empire, and Captain Slavin was placed in command of combating the Free Ryloth movement. Though Slavin's attacks and strategies were clumsy, and the Twi'leks could evade capture easily, his forces managed to take control of the Tann Province and set up their headquarters in the Syndulla residence. Gobi reported to Cham that the Empire had mined the Tulara Ravine, which the rebels had previously used to lose Imperial forces in its maze.\n\nAdditionally, unknown to the Twi'leks, the Empire became better at anticipating the movement's moves due to the arrival of Grand Admiral Thrawn, a brilliant strategist who began cracking down on them. Needing support, Cham contacted the Spectres and asked Hera to deliver supplies to the resistance. While Cham and Numa were on a mission, Gobi met with Hera after she slipped past the orbital blockade. Cham and Numa were forced to retreat, however, and were chased by an Imperial convoy near the Tulara Ravine. Cham contacted Gobi for a pickup, and he, along with Hera, arrived aboard the Ghost to rescue the two. After destroying the convoy, Hera flew the Ghost close to the ground, allowing Cham and Numa to jump aboard with their blurrgs.\n\nGobi sat in the Ghost's main hold with Cham, Numa, and the Spectres when Hera entered and reunited with her father. Cham informed Hera that the Imperials had taken over the Tann Province and that they had become more swift and precise in their counterattacks. Hera asked Cham if he was able to save their family's Kalikori when he escaped their home, prompting Ezra to ask what a Kalikori was. Numa stated that the Kalikori was a totem passed down in Twi'lek families that honor their ancestors. Glie added that each parent added to the artwork to include themselves in the legacy, and Sabine remarked that it was family history as living art. Cham solemnly told Ezra that Hera would have inherited the Syndulla Kalikori, but Hera instead told her father that she was still going to and was going to take it back in honor of her mother. Cham, Gobi, Numa, and the Spectres offered to help her, and they devised a plan to have Hera and a disguised Ezra and Chopper sneak into the Tann Province by creating a diversion inside a ravine near the province.\n\nInside the ravine, the team prepared to ambush an incoming Imperial convoy by splitting into different groups around the pass; Cham, Gobi, and a pack of blurrgs on one side, Kanan and Zeb on the other, and Sabine and Numa on a cliff above them. As the patrol neared them, Zeb sent a signal to Cham, who then sent one to Numa. Glie and Cham rushed out from hiding with their blurrgs and went headfirst towards the patrol, firing at the stormtroopers and distracting them. Sabine detonated several explosives underneath the convoy, and the rest of the group joined Gobi and Cham in the fray. Amid the commotion, everyone got on a blurrg and retreated, closely followed by the patrol, giving Hera and Ezra a chance to head for the Syndulla estate on a speeder bike, where they joined Chopper, who had already snuck into the compound.\n\nGobi and Numa led the group through the ravine, and they believed to have lost the Imperials until an AT-DP walker and Imperial Troop Transport arrived and fired on them. One of the blasts hit the blurrg Kanan and Sabine were riding, and they were stranded in the open while Glie and the others rushed to cover. Cham yelled to Gobi to fire his rocket launcher, and the two rode out to where Kanan and Sabine were. Glie jumped off his blurrg and fired his rocket launcher at the ravine wall above the AT-DP, creating a rockfall that crushed several ground stormtroopers and created a temporary blockade against the transports.",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - A dangerous gambit[]\n\nThe bleeders caused the Star Destroyer's shields to fluctuate, and Gobi stated that they had trapped the ship. Cham asked Kallon if the bleeders were working, and when Kallon confirmed that the Perilous' shields were down, Cham ordered Gobi to launch all droid ships. Glie sent the signal, and from the probe droids, they could see their fleet speed out from the asteroids. Cham had Kallon magnify one of the probe readings onto the Destroyer's launch bay, where they saw a contingent of V-wings pour out of it. He asked what the status of the shields was, and Kallon told him that the ship was too far out for an accurate reading. The screens, however, then showed the shield net around the Perilous flare and die out, and Gobi slammed his fist onto the table before him in excitement. They watched as the mines continued to pelt the ship, and as the vulture droids closed in and began firing, Glie eagerly watched the battle ensue. Though some of the vulture droids entered a dogfight with the Imperial V-wings, a separate group went straight for the Perilous, speeding into the ship and deploying their cargo of explosive buzz droids. Explosions rocked the Perilous, and back in the command center, Gobi smiled as he paced the floor while watching the screens. Glie then saw a reading that the ships' weapons were down and informed the others that it was defenseless, leading Cham to order Kallon to send in the second wave of vulture droids.\n\nEveryone in the command center watched silently a single V-wing depart from the rest of the Imperial contingent, and Gobi broke the silence by asking what the ship was doing. Cham recognized that Vader was helming the ship and destroyed many of the incoming vulture droids with only the Force. The vulture droids, buzz droids, and mines collided, and the Imperial V-wings formed a protective perimeter around the Perilous. Once Vader returned to the Destroyer, the burning ship began heading towards Ryloth, and Cham was contacted by a panicked Belkor, whom he forced to continue with the plan. Cham ordered the start of phase two, earning questioned looks from Glie, Xira, and Kallon, who were unaware of the plan. Upon learning of a second phase, Gobi showed excitement, but Cham stared him down until his glee faded. Gobi asked if he had said something wrong, and Cham reprimanded him, saying that what they were doing was not a game and that people were dying. Glie tried to save face and remarked that it was only Imperial people, which Cham acknowledged but again insisted to Gobi that it was no game. His skin darkening from embarrassment, Glie agreed and calmed down. At Cham's orders, several repair ships secretly filled with members of the Free Ryloth Movement descended on the Perilous, ostensibly responding to a distress signal from Belkor.\n\nLed by Isval, the parties boarded the Perilous and attached twelve explosive charges to the ship's hyperdrive and adjacent amplifiers. Realizing the ship was going to explode, Vader ordered an evacuation of Imperial forces and, after failing to capture Isval and her team, he and the Emperor fled the Perilous aboard an escape craft that crashed on Ryloth. The Perilous was destroyed above Ryloth, but the Free Ryloth Movement was unable to assassinate Vader, the Emperor, or Senator Taa, who also survived. Cham and Isval focused on locating the crashed Imperial leaders. On Ryloth, Cham led his freedom fighters in hunting the Sith Lords, but his plan was complicated by Belkor's decision to turn against him and the threat Vader and the Emperor proved to Rylothian civilians. Cham's plan ultimately failed, and he ordered a retreat of the Free Ryloth Movement, suffering numerous losses, including Isval. Despite the movement's failure, they continued their struggle and maintained steady resistance against Imperial forces.",

        "content": "# Gobi Glie - A dangerous gambit[]\n\nIn the years after breaking from the Empire, Cham led the Free Ryloth Movement, a new guerrilla resistance with Gobi as one of his top fighters once again. As the Empire increased its hold on Ryloth with Senator Taa's blessing, the Free Ryloth Movement expanded in kind, establishing a network of informants, numerous hidden bases across the system, and a stockpile of supplies and necessary materials. Cham, Gobi, and the movement recruited hundreds of volunteers and led many raids on the Imperials, killing dozens of military personnel and disrupting the spice trade. Cham made an ally in Imperial Colonel Belkor Dray, who supported the Free Ryloth movement to undermine his superior officer, Moff Delian Mors, the spice-addled governor of Ryloth. Mors lived in a luxurious palace on Ryloth's largest moon, and Dray saw Syndulla's resistance as a means to replace her. The Free Ryloth Movement had little to show for its early successes and faced losses as fighting increased. Among those killed during the resistance was Eleni, whose death spurred Cham to devote himself fully to his cause, straining his relationship with Hera.\n\nIn 14 BBY, a rebel attempt to hijack an Imperial weapons shipment at Yaga Minor was foiled by Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine's chief enforcer, who led a V-wing squadron in crushing the Twi'lek insurgents who had stolen the cache. Following the incident, Cham learned from his spies that Vader, Senator Taa, and the Emperor would be traveling to Ryloth aboard Vader's flagship, the Star Destroyer Perilous. Intent on dealing a major blow to the Empire, Cham devised a plan to target the Perilous and destroy it, thus removing the two heads of the Empire and Taa alongside them. At their underground base on Ryloth's third moon, Gobi helped Cham and several of the movement's top members, Isval, Xira, and Kallon, map out their plot to attack the Perilous. They had nine days until the ship was supposed to arrive at Ryloth, and Cham coerced Belkor to divert Imperial patrol craft and flight clearances to aid them. Gobi and the others assembled a large assault force to take down the Star Destroyer consisting of repurposed Clone Wars\u2013era vulture droids, buzz droids, mines, and shield bleeders.\n\nOn the day the Perilous was to arrive at Ryloth, Gobi joined Cham at the command center of their base with Xira, Kallon, and the droid D4L1. While Gobi manned the subspace transmitter, Xira monitored data readouts, and Kallon stood by as a consulting engineer. Nine viewscreens mounted on the wall showed the outer reaches of Ryloth's system as seen from a half dozen probe droids positioned in the planet's asteroid belt. All their droid ships were hidden in the asteroid belt as well, powered down to almost zero, and a minefield had been laid out in the surrounding space. Gobi and the others waited intently for signs of the Perilous when, suddenly, Xira yelled out that a ship was coming out of hyperspace.\n\nCham ordered the mines to be activated and shield bleeders to be put on standby. He placed a hand on Gobi's shoulder and told him to be ready to transmit orders to the droid ships. Glie, shaking with excitement and tension, replied that he was more than ready and stated that they would force-feed the Imperials some fire. As the Perilous emerged from hyperspace, the ship was pelted with hundreds of mines. Xira reported that the ship was attempting to reverse, and everyone looked at the screens. Cham stated that it seemed there was little damage from the mines, but Gobi pointed out that it had only taken little damage so far. Though they had wanted the Perilous closer to the asteroid field, Cham ordered Glie to activate the shield bleeders.",

After considering some possibilities on the Star Wars fan wiki Wookieepedia, Candon decided that leaving the character's species ambiguous would play well into their characterization and dynamic with the Ronin.\n\n",

They took refuge behind some boulders and entered a gunfight with the oncoming Imperial forces. The Imperials, however, stopped firing as they neared, and a hologram of Captain Slavin was broadcast from the AT-DP. Slavin ordered to speak with Cham and mentioned that it was about Hera. Cham demanded to know where she was, and Slavin revealed that he had captured her and Bridger. He told Cham that both would be executed unless he surrendered. Cham walked out from behind a boulder, and Gobi tried to dissuade him from surrendering and said that he was too important, but Cham argued that Hera was just as important. He told Glie that he would trade his life for hers and that she would lead in his place. Cham demanded to know from Slavin what assurance he had that Hera and Ezra would be released, but all Slavin said was that, if Cham didn't arrive by sundown, both would be terminated. Sabine sarcastically noted that the trap couldn't be more obvious, and Cham turned to the group and asked them all to use his sacrifice to free Hera and Ezra.\n\nGobi and the rest of the rebels boarded the Ghost and flew to the Syndulla home, where Slavin was waiting with Hera and Bridger. Though Cham was willing to turn himself in, Hera surprised him by revealing that Chopper had set several explosives inside their house. Hera ordered Chopper to detonate them, destroying the Syndulla's house and giving them a chance to escape aboard the Ghost. The ship flew past Thrawn's light cruiser, but the Grand Admiral refused to retaliate and instead allowed them to get away. The Ghost later landed near a gorge, where Gobi and Numa mingled with the Spectres while Cham spoke with Hera and Kanan.",

He additionally used an RPS-6 rocket launcher during the mission to recover the Syndulla Kalikori. Glie was also the owner of his own starship, a Rainhawk-class transport. The ship was an outdated model and was later shot down by Crosshair during Gobi's early insurgency against the Empire, after a supply run where he purchased three dozen DC-15A blasters and a case of thermal detonators.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Glie wore a pair of brown camouflage pants and a white shirt that, by the Battle of Ryloth, was in desperate need of a wash. During the early Imperial era, Gobi wore black and gray combat gear over a brown shirt, with gray vambraces on his forearms. In the later years of the Free Ryloth Movement, Glie had mismatched body armor, including gray torso armor alongside white arm gauntlets with yellow stripes.\n\n",

The storyteller did not discourage the attention that the others in the caravan gave to them and their companions, telling stories to the various travelers. When the conversation changed to the supposed tales of the Sith dark lord and his witch, the latter of whom was said to be raising an army of the dead, attention drifted to the Traveler. The storyteller suggested that stories about the dead often held some truth, an answer that pleased some of the others.\n\nAs the caravan continued, it began to drift apart, with the remaining members running for Osou's gates as it began to rain. The Traveler opted to linger in the shelter of a nearby tree, observing the rain curiously before offering the Ronin some fruit they had been given by one of the women from the caravan. The Ronin was paranoid of whether the fruit was poisoned, and the Traveler chided him, informing the wanderer of its origin. Noticing the Ronin's silence, the Traveler asked if they had been insufficiently dramatic; they once more noted his weapon and its illegal nature, warning him to be careful when they reached the spaceport. The rain soon stopped, and the trio ventured on to Osou spaceport, where the Traveler parted ways with the Ronin, finding both the local cantina and teahouse vying for their services.\n\nAt the cantina, however, the Traveler met a Gran guard, who made claims about the presence of a Sith in a village to the south, the direction from which the Ronin had come\u2014the former Sith had dueled and defeated the Sith bandit Kouru there. The Traveler, deducing that the Ronin would have ordinarily mentioned such a remarkable event, sought out their former traveling companion, recounting what the Gran had told them. The Ronin asked whether their words were a warning, and the Traveler said it was only a warning if the former Sith needed one; however, it came too late, for the Ronin was confronted by the Gran and several other bounty hunters. The Ronin made an escape, but was subsequently attacked by Kouru, who had been revived after their duel.\n\n",

The decades-long resistance movements led by Gobi Glie and Cham Syndulla were credited and lauded by the Twi'leks for the victory. A philosophical successor to the Free Ryloth Movement emerged in the form of the Ryloth Defense Authority, a militia devoted to maintaining Ryloth's hard-fought freedom and neutrality.\n\nAt some point, Eirriss Ryloth Defense Tech, an arms manufacturer associated with the Free Ryloth Movement, produced a blaster pistol named after Gobi Glie, the Glie-44. The blaster had a lightweight, rugged construction, with a power cartridge as ammunition and a reactant gas port cap in its stock. The blaster saw widespread use by the Resistance, a paramilitary force founded in 28 ABY to combat the spread of the First Order, a neo-Imperial junta.\n\n",

At some point after that event, they were known as Idzuna and carried a scion's blade, marking them as the bloodline heir of a Jedi clan. As a Jedi, their master was the Jedi lord Hanrai. The rebellion had ended on the planet Rei'izu, and Hanrai believed there may still be Sith living on that world. As such, he sent Idzuna by themself to eliminate any remaining Sith presence that might be found there. Within Shinsui Temple, Idzuna instead found a child named Mirahi, the daughter of the dark lord who had led the rebellion and the witch whom he had betrayed. The Jedi could not bring themself to abandon or kill the child, and instead attempted to raise and mentor her in the black current and white flare of the Force. Due to their disappearance, Hanrai eventually told their parents that he had lost Idzuna.\n\nFor many years, Idzuna had attempted to nurture Mirahi's unique relationship with the kyber mirror of Shinsui Temple. However, Mirahi grew preoccupied with the mirror and what she could see and reach through it. When she proclaimed that she would end the Jedi and the princes, Idzuna sought to protect her from herself. They summoned the black current, intending to break the mirror, but Mirahi lashed out and inadvertently killed them.\n\nTheir accidental death was temporary; without meaning to, Mirahi restored and bound their ghost as the first Sith demon of her own creation.

The only factions to him were his side or the other's side, with his side being the only one that truly mattered. In his mind, good guys and bad guys simply did not exist. When it came to the factions fighting the First Order-Resistance War, he saw the tyrannical First Order and the ambitious Resistance to be two sides of the same coin, despite one seeking to impose a fascistic order upon the galaxy and the other resisting it to defend freedom. He claimed to have a history with the First Order's technology.\n\nAt some point, DJ took residence in an apartment located in Canto Bight, a city located on the desert world of Cantonica, a planet known for its casinos and racetracks. The city turned into DJ's playground, where he used his slicing skills and equipment to steal money from Canto Bight's wealthy. He also created a persona called \"Denel Strench,\" a big-time gangster who held DJ as his last living associate. Strench's name became known through Canto Bight, with a handful of individuals believing Strench to be real. In truth, the persona was created to serve DJ to take the fall for his own crimes. The Canto Bight Police Department's record on Strench eventually became the longest in the sector.\n\n",

        "content": "# DJ - Leaving Canto Bight[]\n\nWhile this was happening, two Resistance operatives\u2014the technician Rose Tico and a stormtrooper defector known as Finn\u2014and the droid BB-8 traveled to Canto Bight in search of a slicer who could neutralize the technology which enabled the First Order to track the Resistance fleet through hyperspace. However, Rose and Finn were arrested by the Canto Bight Police Department and locked in a prison cell with DJ. Not convinced that DJ could help, they refused his offer. DJ then unlocked all the cells, much to Finn and Rose's surprise.\n\nAs they made their escape, DJ turned a corner and saw BB-8 seemingly take down a few cops. A cop then showed up and told DJ to put his hands in the air. As BB-8 shot several coins at the cop, DJ knocked him out. They then stole a yacht, Libertine, and picked up Finn and Rose, who were about to be found by the police.\n\nAfter escaping from Cantonica on the stolen yacht, DJ requested Tico's pendant of Haysian smelt as payment up front for his services. Finn was opposed to the price, knowing its sentimental value to Tico, but Tico accepted his condition so that the slicer would help their cause. Finn demanded DJ give the pendant back, noting it meant a lot to her. When Finn saw DJ going through all the compartments of the ship, he realized it was not DJ's ship. DJ noted that he and BB-8 stole the ship together. With DJ's help, they infiltrated the First Order Navy flagship Supremacy, which contained the tracking system they sought to disable.\n\n",

        "content": "# Unidentified pirate shanty - History[]\n\nBy the New Republic Era, Captain Tak Rennod had became a well-known figure in pirate lore, with a pirate shanty recounting his history. Infamous for his bestiality, Rennod would plunder multiple starships with ferocity, going down in history as the most feared pirate to have ever lived. According to a story shared by the pirate Silvo, Rennod was after the treasure of At Attin when he suddenly disappeared with his crew and ship, the Onyx Cinder. Unlike the pirate shanty, Silvo's narrative did not specify whether Rennod had ultimately reached At Attin.\n\nAround 9 ABY, the story of Tak Rennod keenly interested former pirate Captain Silvo. Following a munity that ousted him in favor of the Shistavanen Brutus, the man shared a brig with four younglings who claimed to hail from the legendary planet of At Attin. Intrigued by their story, Silvo joined forces with the children and escaped aboard their ship. Over time, his investigation led him to conclude that the younglings' ship was none other that the legendary Onyx Cinder. Furthermore, the pirate droid SM-33\u2014whom the youngsters had reactivated after their departure from At Attin\u2014claimed to have once belonged to Rennod. In addition to providing a more detailed account of Rennod's final moments, such as his crew's mutiny and death by his concubine before crashlanding on At Attin, SM-33 led to the way to Captain Rennod's Lair on the planet Lanupa. Following Silvo's betrayal, he and the children parted ways, and the pirate was apprehended by his crew pending trial.\n\nWhile originally sentenced to death, Silvo was allotted \"equal time\" to defend himself following Chaelt's intervention. By invoking the Pirate's Code, she had secured Silvo's Right of Last Appeal, and the defendant seized that opportunity to deliver a defense speech. The main motive running through his appeal was the hunger for money. According to Silvo, credits were never enough, a situation he wanted to remedy by finding the legendary At Attin. When he pronounced the name \"Tak Rennod,\" Captain Brutus interrupted, noting that Tak Rennod was dead. Rather than argue with the Shistavanen, Silvo simply started singing the shanty. Some crew members joined in, including Kona, Vane, and Pax, the latter gently striking his chest to the rhythm. Others, however\u2014such as Gunter\u2014refrained from joining altogether. The singing suddenly cut off at and never was he seen again. Therefore, Silvo asked what the last line was, and pirate Kona hurried to recite the ending. With the line reminded to them, the pirates were free to finish the shanty. When this spontaneous singalong came to an end, Silvo's death sentence was suspended pending the pirates' arrival on At Attin. In spite of Brutus's pushing for the execution, the convict ultimately not only avoided the punishment, but also reclaimed the leadership of the crew by shooting his predecessor dead.\n\n",

        "content": "# DJ - \"High Roller\"[]\n\nAfter welcoming DJ to the Vesustrian, Dezmoont revealed that he was well aware of DJ's abilities and promised to keep a close eye on him during the duration of his stay. As such, the security guard stuck to DJ's side at every stop DJ made, which included a visit to a fathier track, a tauntaun display, and an upscale restaurant. Upon learning that DJ was apparently being followed by Strench, however, Dezmoont upped the security surrounding DJ.\n\nDJ chafed under the constant surveillance, though, and negotiated a deal to get Dezmoont off his back that included giving the guard the go-ahead to beat him into a pulp if Dezmoont caught him cheating. After Dezmoont left, DJ picked up on a game of Eclipse while Dezmoont watched from a cam droid. While playing, DJ met the podracer pilot Groff Fordly, whom DJ tended to bet on. In exchange for some chips, Fordly offered to give DJ a ride around the Canto Bight strip in his speeder. At that point, the conversation was interrupted by Crupp, who had been released from prison apparently because of Denel Strench, who also told Crupp where to find DJ.\n\nAlthough Vesustrian security stepped in before DJ could be harmed, DJ nonetheless became aware that someone was impersonating Strench. Moments later and after DJ accepted Fordly's offer, Dezmoont returned having had DJ's cheating revealed to him, courtesy of Strench. With help from Ipol and Choi, who arrived to belatedly warn DJ about Crupp, DJ evaded Dezmoont's men and took off into Canto Bight with Fordly.\n\nDezmoont gave chase, though, and followed DJ through the city streets. Fordly protested his involvement in what had become more than just a ride, and as such demanded all of the chips DJ had. DJ complied and handed over 250K worth of chips before ordering Fordly to take a sharp turn that led them into a collision with a parked vehicle. However, the collision occurred in front of Canto Bight police officers, who arrested the pair, thus making DJ unreachable to Dezmoont.\n\nAt that moment, the cam droid from the Vesustrian, which had followed DJ throughout the entire speeder chase, confronted the slicer, who recognized the cam droid as being O1-MG. After being kicked from the Eclipse table at the Coruscant, O1-MG, feeling slighted, took off for DJ's apartment and rummaged through his computer files, where he found the Strench persona: the file was so detailed that when it was downloaded into O1-MG it managed to replace his core data, partially replacing his own identity. Ipol and Choi destroyed O1-MG shortly after, and DJ was placed in a Canto Bight prison.\n\n",

        "content": "# DJ - Running the tables[]\n\nIn 34 ABY, shortly after the Hosnian Cataclysm, DJ patronized the Coruscant Hotel and Casino, where he hit the gaming tables for Eclipse\u2014a holographic card game\u2014with a large sum of stolen money with the intention of stealing even more money by rigging an Eclipse table with virused cash. By uploading corrupted money into the Eclipse table, the game would perform in his favor where the more money he put in, the more money he could withdraw. Ultimately, his plan was to spend a week at Zord's Spa and Bathhouse. DJ eventually settled for a table where he found himself heckled by the gambling protocol droid O1-MG. Unaware of DJ's scheme, the droid was dumbfounded by DJ's aggressive betting and the incredible amounts of money he was losing.\n\nThe droid ignored DJ's comments to mind his own business and became increasingly vocal as DJ tipped a waitress and the game's Zabrak dealer with all but one of his betting chips. However, the droid's pestering was culled by Oosha Choi and Pol Ipol, a pair of Canto Bight Police Department detectives known as honest cops, and as such derided by DJ as suckers. As it happened, they were there to warn DJ and interrogate him about Denel Strench, who they believed was after him due to a series of events that began with the detectives hunting down the arms dealer Flestic Crupp. However, the officers were put off by DJ's nonchalant attitude and the dismissal of the deaths of the \"good men\" on their squad. When Ipol tried to force DJ to come with him, he was stopped by the Coruscant Hotel and Casino's owner, Jorka Edy. The officers were kicked out of the casino for harassing a customer, and DJ was left to continue his scam.\n\nAfter tipping the dealer again, DJ made for the door, having contacted the security team of the Vesustrian resort for an escort to their casino sometime earlier. However, Edy had learned of DJ's scam and followed him out, only to be confronted by Ipol, Choi, and the Vesustrian security team, led by a brutish security guard named Dezmoont. All three parties avoided making a scene by letting Dezmoont escort DJ to the Vesustrian, with Edy doing so in the hopes that a rival casino would fall to the same scam.\n\n",

Pablo Hidalgo created a retcon in Star Wars Insider 91 to acknowledge Partu was a separate character, and that the Prophetess claimed that Wuher was the reincarnated soul of Partu.\n\nSince the official summary of the set suggests each included figure represents a \"familiar character\" from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, it is possible Gotal character Kerru was intended to be one of the film's later-named Gotal characters: Feltipern Trevagg, Cobb Sonbepol, and Hennet Kayn.\n\n",

Krrsantan attacked five Trandoshans who were gambling, holding one in the air. Fwip interceded and chuckled, recalling the Wookiee's gladiatorial career and speaking highly of his skill and reputation as she walked towards him. Attesting to Krrsantan's legendary name that had attracted thousands, as well as to how his brass knuckles were more feared than blasters, Fwip suggested that he had already won everything and that it was beneath him to dismember the Trandoshan. She held out her arm to his and stated that such a display was no longer suitable for more \"civilised\" circumstances, labelling the violence of fighting pits as horror and cruelty.\n\nWhen Krrsantan appeared to pause, Fwip sighed and asked if the Wookiee felt better, before claiming that he, a champion above pettiness, had nothing left to prove. The owner reminded him of his bar tab and told him to release the Trandoshan, promising to cancel his debt. Krrsantan glanced at her but did not obey, instead roaring and tearing off the victim's left arm, much to the onlookers' shock. Fwip let out a sigh and scowled, feeling disgusted, while the Wookiee dropped some credits into the hands of the Twi'lek female server. As Krrsantan exited the building, he growled and stared at Fett, who had observed the altercation from the doorway. The crime lord said to Fwip that her effort had been justified, who shrugged her arms and rolled her eyes, before he left to seek the Wookiee. After Fwip instructed Max Rebo to continue playing music, the cantina attendees resumed their activities. Fett eventually enrolled Krrsantan into his criminal empire.\n\n",

        "content": "# Black Spire Outpost (episode) - Plot summary[]\n\nThe narrator announces that at Galaxy's Edge, Black Spire Outpost is full of danger, mystery, and wonder. The episode opens with a wide landscape shot of Black Spire Outpost's spaceport. Chewbacca exits the Millennium Falcon with a porg on top of a box.\n\nThe porg flies away and explores the town, visiting Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities, where it avoids being trampled by the patrons. It flies to the enclosed encounter and eyes Dok-Ondar, who waves him away. Meanwhile, the DJ droid R-3X plays music at Oga's Cantina. The porg briefly dances on his keyboard before mingling under the drink dispensers. The porg then flies through the streets of Merchant Row, hiding behind a pillar while two patrolling First Order stormtroopers march past. It sees the Resistance spy Vi Moradi hiding in a corner but she motions for the porg not to expose her position.\n\nThe porg visits Ronto Roasters in the Market where the 8D-series smelter droid 8D-J8 is roasting some meat on grills. The porg tries to taste some meat but is picked up by a disapproving Chewbacca. A Kowakian monkey-lizard laughs maniacally in the background.\n\n",

After Boba Fett had become the new leader of his criminal empire in an attack on Jabba's Palace, formerly ruled by Bib Fortuna and before that by Jabba Desilijic Tiure, the Daimyo and his lieutenant Fennec Shand travelled to the Sanctuary to greet Fwip and conduct business with her.\n\nUpon meeting Fett, Fwip extended her welcome and offered the products and services of the establishment to him. When the Daimyo replied that he wanted to discuss business, she complied, but asked whether he wished to allow his Gamorrean guards to be washed and fed. Fett denied the request, stating that the matter would be completed quickly, before introducing Shand and himself and reporting how he had replaced Fortuna. Fwip apologetically remarked that she did not see the man's litter, as Hutt crime lords were often carried on one, to which Fett responded that he preferred to walk by himself. The Daimyo commented that the purpose of his visit was only to introduce himself and guarantee that the Sanctuary would continue to thrive in his empire. Expressing her gratitude, Fwip briefly bowed to Fett, glanced back toward the bar, and clapped to signal her attendants, and then further thanked him for crossing a long distance to come to her cantina. She assigned the establishment to Fett's command, patting his arm before departing. Her tribute to him was paid in profits from her business itself.\n\n",

Though Shaiz denied this, he advised the Daimyo to go to the Sanctuary to find more answers. When Fett, Shand and the two Gamorrean guards arrived inside, the female Twi'lek server whispered to Fwip to note their arrival, and the owner greeted them with a tense expression. She thanked Fett for his patronage and offered a seat at the bar and a drink, but Fett demanded to know what was happening.\n\nFwip initially seemed puzzled, to which the crime lord stated that he had been tipped off by Shaiz, asserting that she was sweating like a gumpta on Mustafar. After Fwip remarked that Fett had not heard the latest news and he further queried, the Twi'lek revealed that two of the late Jabba's cousins had laid claim to the criminal empire. While Fett countered that the Twins were too preoccupied with other Hutt affairs to care about Tatooine, the sound of drums approached, and Fwip looked past him towards the street outside. With the whole cantina falling silent, the gangsters exited the establishment to meet the Hutt litter and listen to their demands. Although Lord Fett refused to yield to the Twins, bloodshed was kept away from Mos Espa at that time.\n\n",

It had three moons, Ghomrassen, Guermessa, and Chenini. Tatooine orbited twin suns, Tatoo I and Tatoo II. According to Jawa folklore, the desert known as the Dune Sea was once a true ocean. The whole planet was covered in harsh deserts, and only a small part of its northern hemisphere could sustain intelligent life. The landscape was covered with sand dunes, mountains, and canyons, which made traversing the planet very difficult. Due to the absence of surface water, those who lived on Tatooine had to draw moisture through the dry air.\n\nRain was incredibly rare on Tatooine, coming once a year, decade, or century. When the rain came, some plants were able to grow in a brief yet glorious period. Inhabiting the planet were many native species, the largest of which were the carnivorous krayt dragons. The common krayt dragon, while more plentiful, was shadowed by the greater krayt dragon, which submerged itself under the shifting sands and used its powerful limbs to traverse through the dunes. In addition, the common bantha and eopie species also found a home on the world, along with dewbacks, rontos, womp rats, massiffs, and scurriers.\n\nThe cities of Tatooine were frequently blasted by sandstorms and the inhabitants always seemed to know when one was coming. Not much distinguished the towns as the poor standard of living was common. The cities were separated from each other by large expanses of deserts. Rural life, on the other hand, was mostly small moisture farms that sold water and food for a meager living.\n\n",

The Drabatan people adopted Sa'Kalla's name as a war cry as they charged into battle. One such Drabatan was the rebel commando Paodok'Draba'Takat, who shouted her name during the Battle of Scarif in 1 BBY.\n\nSa'Kalla was remembered years later through Paodok'Draba'Takat's use of her name in his battle cry, which was included in an artist's journal written no earlier than 34 ABY.

While Prima initially sang the song \"Chicken in the Pot\" in a language that composer John Powell found on the Internet, a linguist converted the lyrics to another language and Prima re-recorded the track. In the final cut of the film, Primoc was performed with a lower pitch by another singer at director Ron Howard's request. John Powell stated that early concept art depicts Primoc's character as a chicken-like creature.\n\n",

While single vaporators often cost 500 credits each, some individuals bought and owned multiple units, creating moisture farms. Often utilizing the extra water for small hydroponic gardens, few gardens yielded enough to make substantial profits. In addition, vaporators required frequent maintenance and security systems to deter attacks from Tusken Raiders, who believed all water was sacred and belonged to them.\n\nTatooine had only a few port cities, including Mos Espa and Mos Eisley. Beside those cities, which attracted many criminals, most settlers of Tatooine operated moisture farms in the expanse of the desert. Due to the planet's dangerously high daytime temperature and whipping sandstorms, most residents of Tatooine kept their skin covered with practical materials that wick away sweat and limit exposure to the harmful ultraviolet radiation of the twin suns.\n\n",

With the Hutt Clan taking near-full control over the trafficking and smuggling trades, new citizens had a large time breaking into the criminal market even though it was more lucrative than the water market. Slavery, while banned through Republic laws, was readily and blatantly practiced under the twin suns. An entire section of Mos Espa was purposed as a Slave Quarter. On Tatooine, at least, the institution of slavery was seen as a socioeconomic symbol of wealth and prestige, resulting in highly protective owners who reluctantly parted with their possessions.

As a young First Order stormtrooper, Finn enjoyed reading comics based on the program that his friend FN-1971 had snuck in. In 34 ABY, Finn, who had since joined the Resistance, chose the alias of \"Kade Genti\" while preparing to infiltrate a party held at Coronet City on the Core Worlds planet Corellia. When the pilot Poe Dameron laughed at Finn's choice upon hearing the name, Javos, who accompanied the group, revealed that it originated from the cartoon and explained that the program had aired during her childhood. Finn recalled his experience reading the show's comics in his youth, citing it as his reason for choosing the name.\n\n",

        "content": "# Tatooine - Early history[]\n\nTatooine was the homeworld of the Jawa and Tusken Raider species. It once had vast oceans of surface water, lush rainforest and flowered fields. According to the Legend of Lehon, Tatooine had also been inhabited by a group called the Kumumgah during this time, but there was little evidence to support the story. Sometime in Tatooine's history, the whole planet became a desert by unknown means when the oceans dried away. Much later, it would be colonized by early settlers and explorers, who mistook the planet for a third sun owing to its highly reflective silicate surface.\n\nAs a result of sporadic and unsuccessful colonization ventures, the planet became a haven for smugglers and criminal activity, while scattered, isolated settlements of hard-working inhabitants attempted to earn a living in the wastes. A long-ago mining boom saw the widespread use of sandcrawlers on the desert plains in an effort to mine valuable minerals. However, after it was discovered that most valuable minerals could be found on the surface, along with most minerals having unwanted metallurgic properties, the sandcrawlers were abandoned and eventually picked up by the native Jawas for use as shelter and mobile bases, from which they collected scrap from thousands of years of crashed spacecraft and failed mining projects.\n\nOffworlders erected various cities in the desert, and colonists who decided to stay on the planet built moisture farms. The B'omarr Order on Tatooine kept their disembodied brains floating in jars that hung below their spider-like droid bodies, and built a monastery on the planet which would eventually come under the ownership of Jabba Desilijic Tiure as his palace.\n\nMost wealth eventually found its way into the city of Mos Espa, with most of it procured from gambling and off-world trade, especially through the lucrative black market. The influx of commercial ventures fueled Mos Espa's growth, eventually securing its regional importance as a hub of economic and financial activity. With high tariffs imposed by the Hutts, some believed themselves able to escape paying them by doing business in the planet's de facto capital, however often found themselves scammed and broke if not through gambling, through simple bad luck.\n\n",

        "content": "# Tatooine - War comes to Tatooine[]\n\nShortly after the Battle of Scarif in the Galactic Civil War, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO landed on Tatooine's surface in an escape pod after their CR90 corvette the Tantive IV was captured by the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. With the droids carrying the technical readouts to the Death Star, a task force was sent to the planet in order to capture the two droids, marking the moment the Empire began to truly pay attention to Tatooine. Upon coming in contact with a Jawa sandcrawler, the two were abducted and later sold to Owen Lars of the Lars moisture farm, with R2 being chosen after another astromech droid, R5-D4 broke down. Later that day, Luke Skywalker, unknowingly Anakin Skywalker's son came across a recorded message of Princess Leia pleading for the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi against the Galactic Empire. Intrigued, if only because R2 later ran away, forcing Luke and C-3PO to retrieve him, the two were attacked by native Tusken Raiders.\n\nBeing saved by Kenobi, Skywalker learned that he was a Jedi while Kenobi offered to train him. Refusing and heading home, Skywalker came across the remains of the sandcrawler that originally sold the two droids to his family. Realizing that it was the work of Imperial forces and that they may have traced the droids back to his house, he rushed back only to find the moisture farm burned to the ground, with the charred remains of his aunt and uncle laying outside in the sun. Agreeing to go with Kenobi to Mos Eisley, they discovered the city under Imperial control and they hired the services of smuggler Han Solo and his partner, Chewbacca to transport them offworld to Alderaan. Barely escaping an intense firefight with multiple sandtroopers, the two escaped Tatooine and several Star Destroyers into hyperspace.\n\nSometime during the Galactic Civil War, Tusken Raiders under the leadership of the Jundland General attacked local settlements. He and his followers were ultimately defeated by a gang of mercenaries located on-world. Having allied with the Rebel Alliance, the gang led the Rebels into a series of successful operations on Tatooine that would conclude with the defeat of the Empire's Tatooine garrison, whose ranks included the 68th Legion. Nevertheless, the Empire would come to reestablish its presence on the desert world, with Lieutenant Ardo Banch serving as an officer in the garrison.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, a shuttle with emissaries in the employ of Jabba, who were meant to negotiate a deal to provide support to the Empire at Weapons Factory Alpha on Cymoon 1, was intercepted by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and a strike team consisting of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa proceeded to the factory, infiltrating and destroying it. The negotiations having failed, Darth Vader returned to Tatooine to negotiate the deal with Jabba in person. After the negotiations were complete, Vader remained on Tatooine shortly to wipe out a Tusken Raider tribe and hire the bounty hunters Boba Fett and Krrsantan to ascertain the identity of the pilot who destroyed the First Death Star. Fett tracked down and dueled Skywalker, who had returned to the late Ben Kenobi's dwelling for education, learning his name and reporting to Vader.\n\nAfter learning he had a son, Vader traveled to Tatooine with his crew, consisting of Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra, 0-0-0, and BT-1, to investigate the Lars Homestead and Kenobi's home. When the Rebel Alliance split its forces up to escape the Empire after its major losses in the Battle of Hoth, the young human Vulaada Klam and her pet qaberworm Gurtyl found themselves on Tatooine after their time with the Rebellion on Hoth. Vader also returned to Tatooine in the aftermath of the duel on Cloud City to investigate the Lars Homestead once more. Following the battle over Jekara, Fett delivered Solo, now frozen in carbonite, to Jabba, where he served as a wall decoration.\n\nFollowing Qi'ra's revival of Crimson Dawn, a contract broker representing the Lady was situated in Bestine, she gave out contracts that could be used to gain favor with the Dawn. Similar contract brokers existed on Tatooine giving out contracts for the Ashiga Clan and the Pyke Syndicate. Despite this, none of these syndicates could set up bases on Tatooine like they had on Akiva, Kijimi and Toshara due to the dominance of the Hutt Cartel on the planet. The Empire also increased their prescence on the planet by this time, having established Fort Sunfire and an Imperial Checkpoint near Bestine. They also set up an Imperial Outpost in the Western Dune Sea and continued their prescence in Mos Eisley.\n\nWhen Aphra was taken over by the Spark Eternal, her allies Sana Starros and Kho Phon Farrus traveled throughout the galaxy to collect those who cared about Aphra to save her. They traveled to Tatooine to recruit Klam, who was sitting atop Gurtyl in a town among several other residents, though Klam ultimately did not accompany them when they traveled to a Rebel Rendezvous to recruit Magna Tolvan.\n\nKitster Banai and Wald returned to Tatooine to free their friends, Melee, Amee, and Seek on a moisture farm on Tatooine. The two sold the owner an energy capsule that they had stolen from the Galactic Empire and gave the money to free all the enslaved workers there. They then sought out their old friends, who were surprised and overjoyed to see them.\n\nAttempting to rescue Solo, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO infiltrated Jabba's Palace disguised as servants after Luke Skywalker \"gifted\" them to the crime lord. Arriving at the palace not long after, Skywalker attempted to bargain with Jabba for his friend's life, only to be refused and dropped into a rancor pit. After a struggle, Luke managed to kill the rancor, angering Jabba and sentencing him and Solo (who was freed by Organa in the guise of a bounty hunter who had captured his friend, Chewbacca) to death in the Great Pit of Carkoon, while Organa became one of Jabba's many entertainers. Later, as they were about to be executed, R2-D2 fired Skywalker's lightsaber at him from Jabba's sail barge, allowing Skywalker, Solo, and Lando Calrissian, who had been disguised as a guard, to make their escape. After an intense shootout, Organa strangled Jabba to death with the chain used to keep her hostage, and Boba Fett was knocked into the sarlacc. Skywalker, Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, Calrissian, and the two droids escaped the planet once more. Although Fett was swallowed by the sarlacc, he survived and managed to escape the creature's stomach, though his armor was stolen by Jawas shortly thereafter due to his weakness from his escape.\n\n",

With the droids carrying the technical readouts to the Death Star, a task force was sent to the planet in order to capture the two droids, marking the moment the Empire began to truly pay attention to Tatooine. Upon coming in contact with a Jawa sandcrawler, the two were abducted and later sold to Owen Lars of the Lars moisture farm, with R2 being chosen after another astromech droid, R5-D4 broke down. Later that day, Luke Skywalker, unknowingly Anakin Skywalker's son came across a recorded message of Princess Leia pleading for the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi against the Galactic Empire. Intrigued, if only because R2 later ran away, forcing Luke and C-3PO to retrieve him, the two were attacked by native Tusken Raiders.\n\nBeing saved by Kenobi, Skywalker learned that he was a Jedi while Kenobi offered to train him. Refusing and heading home, Skywalker came across the remains of the sandcrawler that originally sold the two droids to his family. Realizing that it was the work of Imperial forces and that they may have traced the droids back to his house, he rushed back only to find the moisture farm burned to the ground, with the charred remains of his aunt and uncle laying outside in the sun. Agreeing to go with Kenobi to Mos Eisley, they discovered the city under Imperial control and they hired the services of smuggler Han Solo and his partner, Chewbacca to transport them offworld to Alderaan. Barely escaping an intense firefight with multiple sandtroopers, the two escaped Tatooine and several Star Destroyers into hyperspace.\n\nSometime during the Galactic Civil War, Tusken Raiders under the leadership of the Jundland General attacked local settlements. He and his followers were ultimately defeated by a gang of mercenaries located on-world. Having allied with the Rebel Alliance, the gang led the Rebels into a series of successful operations on Tatooine that would conclude with the defeat of the Empire's Tatooine garrison, whose ranks included the 68th Legion. Nevertheless, the Empire would come to reestablish its presence on the desert world, with Lieutenant Ardo Banch serving as an officer in the garrison.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, a shuttle with emissaries in the employ of Jabba, who were meant to negotiate a deal to provide support to the Empire at Weapons Factory Alpha on Cymoon 1, was intercepted by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and a strike team consisting of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa proceeded to the factory, infiltrating and destroying it. The negotiations having failed, Darth Vader returned to Tatooine to negotiate the deal with Jabba in person. After the negotiations were complete, Vader remained on Tatooine shortly to wipe out a Tusken Raider tribe and hire the bounty hunters Boba Fett and Krrsantan to ascertain the identity of the pilot who destroyed the First Death Star. Fett tracked down and dueled Skywalker, who had returned to the late Ben Kenobi's dwelling for education, learning his name and reporting to Vader.\n\nAfter learning he had a son, Vader traveled to Tatooine with his crew, consisting of Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra, 0-0-0, and BT-1, to investigate the Lars Homestead and Kenobi's home. When the Rebel Alliance split its forces up to escape the Empire after its major losses in the Battle of Hoth, the young human Vulaada Klam and her pet qaberworm Gurtyl found themselves on Tatooine after their time with the Rebellion on Hoth. Vader also returned to Tatooine in the aftermath of the duel on Cloud City to investigate the Lars Homestead once more. Following the battle over Jekara, Fett delivered Solo, now frozen in carbonite, to Jabba, where he served as a wall decoration.",

        "content": "# Tatooine - Native peoples[]\n\nThe Raiders, native to the planet, were a nomadic tribal society with strict social and moral codes, along with defined territorial boundaries. Frequent colonial trespasses on their sovereign territory, along with the collusion between old values and galactic modernization, often forced the Tuskens to attack colonists whom they both vehemently feared and despised. Tusken Raiders often attacked isolated settlements on the fringes of their territory such as Anchorhead, and often took potshots at podracers during the Boonta Eve Classic, celebrated once every year as part of the Boonta Eve holiday.\n\nJawas were also a native species to Tatooine, and as such deeply entrenched into a nomadic lifestyle. Unlike the Tuskens, whom they attempted to avoid, Jawas frequently sold collected scrap metal and droids to the scattered settlers on the planet, earning a reputation as merchants and vagabonds. Myth and folklore also played an important part in Jawa society, with the Jawa's belief that the great Dune Sea was once a true ocean. Later research into ancient fossil-bearing rock and eroded canyons seemed to support this notion. Nonetheless, most of Tatooine's inhabitants refused to believe the story, finding it far-fetched and ludicrous. The Jawas made use of sandcrawlers, former mining vehicles claimed by the Jawas as mobile bases.\n\n",

The anthology was officially announced on April 7 with the news that it was a collection of 40 short stories, written by 40 authors, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, which was released in 1977. The book was released in October 2017. It is now also available as an e-book.\n\nThe book is told from the perspective of background characters in A New Hope. Characters include X-wing pilots who fought in the Battle of Yavin alongside Luke Skywalker, as well as stormtroopers who searched for R2-D2 and C-3PO on Tatooine. The characters who populated the background of A New Hope helped create the world that fans fell in love with, so this book helps flesh those characters out in the official Star Wars canon.\n\n",

Rowan Freemaker is meditating but notices his siblings are silent. When he asks them what they are doing, they reply that they are being quiet so that he can lead them to the kyber crystal so that they can finish building the Arrowhead. Rowan says that he is unable to concentrate because it is too quiet and they are watching him. Roger then plays some loud cantina music, which Rowan objects. When Roger asks Rowan what he wants because he doesn't want quiet or noise, Rowan tells everyone to do what they usually do.\n\nHowever, Rowan soon gets frustrated that they are acting normal. Zander counters that there is no such thing as normal for the Freemakers. He says that this is the right amount of tension they can work with. Rowan senses that the crystal is far away but thinks they can still reach it. At that point, they are attacked by M-OC's starship Tracker I. Rowan remarks that this is too much tension. Zander wonders how M-OC rebuilt himself so fast.\n\nRoger says that M-OC has got blasters, pulse cannons, and jets, and adds that the Emperor clearly knows how to build a droid unlike some people. Kordi Freemaker tells Roger to shoot at M-OC instead of taking pot shots at them. During the chase, Rowan tells his siblings to buy him time while he tries to meditate. M-OC contacts him by hologram and tells him that time is not in his favor. He taunts Rowan that he is relentless and does not tire unlike Rowan. However, Zander terminates the transmission.\n\nWith Zander's encouragement, Rowan focuses and tells them to jump to Outer Rim Territories, twelve parsecs past Terminus. The StarScavenger jumps into hyperspace. M-OC is about to calculate their jump trajectory but he is interrupted by the Emperor, who queries about the weather on Qalydon before demanding the whereabouts of Rowan and the Kyber Saber. M-OC replies that he has neither Rowan nor the Kyber Saber. The Emperor accuses M-OC of not understanding what is at stake and suggests he come to Coruscant for a little \"re-education.\"\n\n",

The Emperor uses this to explain why he wants the Kyber Saber and demands to know why M-OC hasn't delivered it yet. The droid confirms that he has not yet delivered Rowan or the crystals to him.\n\nHe adds that he thought it would be clear to him. The Emperor describes talking to M-OC like the \"backside of a bantha,\" which Vader agrees. The Emperor also complains about M-OC's failures. Feeling generous, he asks the droid to give him one reason why he shouldn't throw him on the scrap pile. M-OC replies that he needs an XX-23 S-thread tracker. The Emperor is pleased.\n\nM-OC explains that the XX-23 S-thread tracker would allow him to track the Freemakers more precisely. When the Emperor asks him why he doesn't have one, the droid explains that Darth Vader has blocked his requests for the technology. The Emperor is furious with Lord Vader and approves M-OC's request. He orders him to get the Freemaker boy and the Kyber Saber.\n\nThe Emperor then questions Lord Vader about Luke Skywalker and the progress with the second Death Star. Vader replies that these are complicated questions as the Emperor's hands begin to radiate with Force lightning. An Imperial officer then brings Lord Vader news about a rebel fleet over Rodia. Vader takes the opportunity to take leave, leading the Emperor to remark that it is ironic that Vader was saved by the Rebellion.\n\n",

It then went to appear in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi and in all three films of the prequel trilogy. The planet wasn't actually named in Episode IV, though director George Lucas had called it Utapau in all but the film's first draft only to rename it in the fourth draft after the movie's desert location Tataouine (French spelling) in Tunisia (see also Tunisia for other Tunisian-inspired names).\n\nFilming of Tatooine scenes took place around Djerba, Matmata, Tozeur, Medenine, Ksar Hadada, the Chott el Jerid, and La Grande in Tunisia, Death Valley in California, and Yuma in Arizona. Anthony Forrest, the actor who played Luke Skywalker's friend Laze Loneozner in an ultimately cut scene and stormtrooper Wanten in Mos Eisley, recalled the filming in Tunisia to be a \"freewheeling\" experience he could enjoy. According to Forrest, the moment had the spirit of an independent film production, with Lucas even personally applying more dirt to their costumes. In what he declared a moment of great filmmaking that helped create the feel of the Star Wars universe, Forrest rationalized that Lucas did so because Tatooine was a world where water needed to be harvested, so people on the planet would not waste it extensively cleaning their clothes or equipment. The heat in Tunisia was an issue for everyone on set. Forrest was sunburnt during the filming in Tunisia, which made acting in the stormtrooper armor difficult. However, he was nevertheless very happy to share a scene with Alec Guinness.\n\nStar Wars Insider writer Melissa T. Miller theorized in the piece \"Got Blue Milk?\" that blue wildflowers grew as fields on Tatooine within its deserts. As Miller reasoned, if the blue hue of blue milk was natural, banthas eating blue foliage would explain where the blue milk's coloration came from.\n\n",

The official name is Kepler-16b, but many call it the real Tatooine (even NASA calls it the \"Tatooine-like\" planet). A Lucasfilm employee was present at NASA's news conference. Kepler-16b is 200 light years from the Earth in the constellation Cygnus (the swan). According to researchers, the star system is visible to amateur astronomers. Coincidentally, the planet was discovered a day before the release of the Star Wars Blu-rays in North America.\n\nAs of January 11, 2012, two more gas giants that orbit two suns each have been found. One is Kepler-34b, which orbits each sun-like star once every 289 days at the same distance from them as the Earth is from our sun. Kepler-34b is located 4900 light years away from Earth. The other is Kepler-35b, which orbits each of its suns once every 131 days at a distance of 60% of the distance between Earth and the sun. Kepler-35b's suns are smaller than our sun and are located 5400 light-years from Earth.\n\nThe Centaurus constellation contains a planet that orbits three stars \u2013 one more than Tatooine a configurationwhich scientists were previously unsure could survive.\n\nTatooine could also be taken as a derivative of the planet Mongo of the Flash Gordon serials, presented as a desert planet too in some media. This assumption is strongly supported by the presence of the starport Gordon on the planet Aquilae in Episode IV's rough draft, the same planet which was later named Utapau in the second draft, where Gordon is briefly mentioned. Utapau, as noted above, was ultimately renamed Tatooine.\n\n",

Rowan sees another writing saying \"that the Force builds and lifts us all.\" Looking at the hole at the top, Kordi assumes that is the exit and suggests that they could use a Force Builder. With Kordi's encouragement, Rowan uses the Force to levitate the blocks so that they can almost reach the top. Kordi allows Rowan to climb on her shoulders but the blocks collapse under their weight. Rowan and Kordi make a second attempt but also fail. This leads Rowan to realize they are clearly missing something.\n\nBack aboard the StarScavenger, Zander has finished his check of the major-minor ship systems. With the exception of the power coupling, the StarScavenger is a dead ship. Roger panics that the mynocks will rip through the hull and feed on his circuits. Zander wishes for a break so that they can piece the ship back together and get her airborne. Roger says that they need something to lure them away but fears they will be used as bait.\n\nInside the cave, Kordi is unable to find hidden levers. Taking stock of the situation, she deduces that they will dive in the cave if they don't reach the exit. Rowan says that the riddle must mean something. Kordi recalls the writing \"The Force builds and lifts us all.\" After the failed ladders, Rowan realizes that he was building the wrong thing. He instead uses the Force to assemble a platform for them to stand on. Using the kyber crystals below, he generates enough force to bring them to the surface.\n\nThe two reach the summit only to see a tall tower in the distance, which is separated by a deep chasm. Believing that the kyber crystal is at the top of the tower, Rowan is excited and thinks that they are going to complete the Arrowhead, save the Rebellion, stop the Empire, and free the galaxy. Kordi reminds Rowan to deal with reality by asking him to consider how they will get over there. Rowan agrees that Kordi has raised a good point.\n\n",

Roger can hear some faint screeching but Zander does not until a mynock attacks Roger. Zander drives the creature away. Rowan thanks Zander for saving him but recalls that he brought them to this dangerous world. Roger says that his emotional processors have mixed feelings about Zander. Zander points to an approaching flock of mynocks and the two retreat back to the StarScavenger.\n\nRowan and Kordi explore a cave with murals. Rowan thinks that it is a temple and tells Kordi that the crystal might be inside. He tells her that something drew him to the planet, leading Kordi to wonder what it could be. As Rowan and Kordi continue their journey, she asks why the original Force Builders built stairs that went nowhere. She then finds a writing on the wall that says that \"the key to unlocking the mysteries before you is to turn to the Force.\"\n\nRowan uses the Force to raise the circular floor beneath them. Rowan remarks that it is \"child-lock\" but can only be open with the Force. The floor they are standing is inscribed with the symbol of the Jedi Order. Rowan realizes that the Jedi built this place and that they want him to use the Force. Rowan believes that the kyber crystal has got to be in here. Kordi says that hopefully they can find a way out as well. Rowan tells her to hurry up.\n\nBack at the StarScavenger, Roger and Zander are overwhelmed by a flock of mynocks. A mynock has latched onto Roger's head, intending to suck his \"sweet juicy powers.\" Zander yells at Roger to get onto the ship. Zander uses a welding torch to drive the mynock away. Roger thanks the Maker. Zander and Roger man the ship's guns to prevent the mynocks from sucking all the ship's power away. Zander warns Roger there is a mynock on his barrel.\n\nRoger manages to shake the mynock off. Roger blasts at the surrounding ground, causing the tiny kyber crystals to explode and tilt the StarScavenger's position. Roger is still delighted to learn that kyber crystals are explosive but Zander says they need to rethink their mynock strategy.\n\n",

        "content": "# The Pit and the Pinnacle - Crash-landing[]\n\nWhile the StarScavenger travels through hyperspace, Rowan is worried. Kordi reassures her younger brother that they are save from M-OC while Roger makes some repairs. A weary Rowan says they are safe for now. Zander hopes that they get to go to somewhere nice because the StarScavenger has taken a beating. Roger hopes for a rest, relaxation, and repair. The StarScavenger is pulled into the atmosphere of an unidentified terrestrial world, covered in ruins, mountains, and grass. Zander is about to joke about a smooth landing but Kordi stops him in his tracks.\n\nUpon disembarking, Kordi asks Rowan if this is the planet. He says he can sense the kyber crystals. The Freemakers subsequently discover that the planet is littered with tiny kyber crystals. However, Rowan finds that these crystals are smaller than those in his vision and thinks that none of them would work on the Arrowhead. Zander says he can repair the StarScavenger but notes that they have lost their stabilizer fin. Kordi assigns Zander and Roger to put the ship back together while she and Rowan search for the stabilizer fin and crystals.\n\nRoger complains that Rowan and Kordi get to explore a dangerous, uncharted world while they get to stay with the ship. While walking, Rowan confides with Kordi that M-OC is getting to him and fears that he can't defeat the droid. Kordi reassures her little brother they can just like they defeated Naare in the past. Rowan is worried that the Emperor will only send someone else and that the dark side never stops. Rowan soon finds the stabilizer fin and tells Kordi that he senses something calling to him.\n\n",

        "content": "# Pyloon's Saloon - Description[]\n\nPyloon's was situated opposite Dendra's Antiquities flanking the main street of the Outpost. The building was erected from stone and complimented with wooden decking and stairs with rusted red and yellow metal support foundations and roofing decor. It had three distinct dome-shaped structures across the roof and a large turbine. The exterior of the building had protruding generators and vents and was surrounded with miscellaneous scrap, including an old landspeeder, droid parts, and crates.\n\nThe main entrance was labeled with a simple sign that read saloon and had a detection device above the door with green material drapes hung above the entrance.\n\nThe walkway leading through to the main bar area had a wooden floor with circular orange and brown rugs with three burnt orange sofa areas. The walls were adorned with numerous artifacts including hanging bone decorations, hookah pipes, and large blasters fixed to the wall. Red and green drapes covered parts of the walls, as did a selection of posters including ones warning locals not to feed the boglings and advertising Pyloon pie. An inactive droid detector was placed on the wall by the door. The arched door that opened to the main bar area was guarded by a TT-8L/Y7 gatekeeper droid.\n\nA stone staircase with wooden handrails led to the main bar area, with black tubing providing electricity to the bar from outside. The interior was constructed from wooden foundations with additional metal pipes and vents, and golden metal furnishings and rails.\n\nA large curved bar was present and included a built-in rail that allowed the saloon bartender droid M-6NK to travel around the bar and into the adjoined kitchen area. The bar was fitted with several dispensing units with the bottom of the saloon's vast aquarium as its backdrop. Dritus had a modified chair on one end of the bar that allowed him to oversee the bar and the patrons.\n\nThe ground level of the saloon was adorned with large blue and gold, red and blue, and purple and gold sheets that draped from the ceiling and over certain wall areas. A collection of artifacts was visible above the bar area upon entering, including a Republic Clone Trooper helmet and a diorama of a sail barge, with additional cultural decor placed throughout the level. Further posters were found on the walls including a poster depicting Pyloon, one advertising Doma's shop, another stating GONK chargers were available on the premises, and warnings that Rayvis, B1-series battle droids, and the Bedlam Raiders had been seen on patrol and were not to be allowed entry.\n\nThere was seating available around the bar with two standalone tables and three booths tucked into the walls. The booths contained orange sofa seating and each contained varying artifacts including Phillak skulls and hookah pipes, and the booth frequented by bounty hunter Caij Vanda had blasters hung to the wall, an assortment of weapons, an additional Clone Trooper helmet plus bounty hunter helmets and B1 droid heads presented as trophies.\n\nA stage in the corner of the saloon provided an area for entertainment, complete with a sound desk and a rudimentary lighting system. The DJ droid DD-EC and musician Ashe Javi eventually performed there with Javi describing the acoustics of the venue as wonky but found that the sound was to her liking.\n\nA lobby between the bar and kitchen contained serving utensils, drinking vessels, GNK power droids and was decorated with a brown, orange, and light blue circular rug. The area also provided access to a small storage room in which the Mirialan Moran stored some belongings and a view of the kitchen area which was stocked with various cooking utensils and ovens.\n\nThis level also provided access to the refreshers which contained three cubicles, a hand dryer, washing sinks, dirty mirrors, and an additional GNK unit. A post on the wall stated that the sale and use of death sticks was prohibited.\n\nThe area also led to a staircase down to Dritus's quarters, with hidden access to a vast network of smugglers' tunnels. Within Dritus' quarters were items retained from his prior adventures including Cere Junda's hallikset, Cal Kestis' Bracca scrapper outfit, and a collection of Dritus' red and silver flight suits. There was also a workbench, power generators, a bunk bed, and a selection of flora collected from various planets. A private entrance was available also leading to the landing pad.\n\nLeading up to the second floor were two stone stairways situated on either side of the bar. The walls leading up were decorated with further colored drapes and posters, including one advertising the maintenance services of Zygg Soza. The upstairs balcony level had additional seating and tables which offered a clearer view of the bar area and aquarium which was eventually maintained by the Sakavian Skoova Stev.\n\nOne of the tables would be used by the rescued High Republic droid ZN-A4 to trade datacards with Kestis. A poster on the wall depicted the Trontoshell of Dredger Gorge in its natural habitat. A smaller room was cleared to host a Holotactics table run by Bhima Ook and Tulli Mu.\n\nAnother stone stairwell led to the rooftop area. The area was home to a large garden area with four plots to plant seeds and was managed by Pili Walde. Across the area were spare planting pots, shelving units, and work areas. A small rock formation and water fountain could be found in one corner. Access to the turbine roof could be found here due to the overgrown roots forming a vertical pathway.\n\n",

As a boy, Greedo was noted for his temper and tendency to pick fights with others, which his friend, Wald warned would lead to trouble. In adulthood, Greedo was overconfident and slow on the uptake, and something of a poor shot with a blaster. He thought highly of himself as a \"big time\" bounty hunter due to his employment to Jabba the Hutt, even believing himself more prestigious than Boba Fett, though others saw him as unremarkable.\n\nGreedo earned a reputation for being careless and irresponsible. He ignored evidence that he should pursue a different career, instead opting to remain on Tatooine, hoping for his big break. He was a frequent customer of Chalmun's Cantina, considering it his base of operations and preferred venue for death deals. He was known for rotten luck, and that proved true for the majority of his life, as he was constantly convinced his luck would change. Despite his overwhelmingly poor fortunes, Greedo was a persistent and cautious operator. However, when he finally cornered Solo, he carelessly let his guard down and began gloating, an uncharacteristic mistake that cost him his life.\n\n",

These character traits were later given to Oga Garra, owner of Oga's Cantina. One of the songs played at Oga's Cantina since the opening of Galaxy's Edge was credited to a character named Gaya.\n\nEarly press information for Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, a hotel and entertainment experience open from 2022 to 2023 at the Walt Disney World Resort, mentioned a \"galactic superstar\" that would perform at the hotel. According to audition material posted by The Walt Disney Company, Gaya was classified as a mezzo-soprano, with a musical style described as a \"neo-soul, jazzy, funk\" hybrid. The audition form suggested that applicants for the role perform the song \"Abracadabra\" by Judith Hill.\n\nConcept art labeled \"Gaya\" was included in the book The Art of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge with two pieces of artwork in the section dedicated to Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, though it did not confirm that she was the still-unnamed female Twi'lek entertainer that would appear at that hotel. Artist Brian Matyas posted the art to Instagram, referring to Gaya as a \"vocalist in a band that would play in the park and in the hotel.\" A presentation that was part of Disney's Destination D23 event on November 20, 2021 confirmed that Gaya was the performer at the hotel and revealed a photo of the character. A promotional video released on November 28 featured an actress dressed as Gaya performing aboard the Halcyon.\n\n",

        "content": "# Pyloon's Saloon - Description[]\n\nPyloon's was situated opposite Dendra's Antiquities flanking the main street of the Outpost. The building was erected from stone and complimented with wooden decking and stairs with rusted red and yellow metal support foundations and roofing decor. It had three distinct dome-shaped structures across the roof and a large turbine. The exterior of the building had protruding generators and vents and was surrounded with miscellaneous scrap, including an old landspeeder, droid parts, and crates.\n\nThe main entrance was labeled with a simple sign that read saloon and had a detection device above the door with green material drapes hung above the entrance.\n\nThe walkway leading through to the main bar area had a wooden floor with circular orange and brown rugs with three burnt orange sofa areas. The walls were adorned with numerous artifacts including hanging bone decorations, hookah pipes, and large blasters fixed to the wall. Red and green drapes covered parts of the walls, as did a selection of posters including ones warning locals not to feed the boglings and advertising Pyloon pie. An inactive droid detector was placed on the wall by the door. The arched door that opened to the main bar area was guarded by a TT-8L/Y7 gatekeeper droid.\n\nA stone staircase with wooden handrails led to the main bar area, with black tubing providing electricity to the bar from outside. The interior was constructed from wooden foundations with additional metal pipes and vents, and golden metal furnishings and rails.\n\nA large curved bar was present and included a built-in rail that allowed the saloon bartender droid M-6NK to travel around the bar and into the adjoined kitchen area. The bar was fitted with several dispensing units with the bottom of the saloon's vast aquarium as its backdrop. Dritus had a modified chair on one end of the bar that allowed him to oversee the bar and the patrons.\n\nThe ground level of the saloon was adorned with large blue and gold, red and blue, and purple and gold sheets that draped from the ceiling and over certain wall areas. A collection of artifacts was visible above the bar area upon entering, including a Republic Clone Trooper helmet and a diorama of a sail barge, with additional cultural decor placed throughout the level. Further posters were found on the walls including a poster depicting Pyloon, one advertising Doma's shop, another stating GONK chargers were available on the premises, and warnings that Rayvis, B1-series battle droids, and the Bedlam Raiders had been seen on patrol and were not to be allowed entry.\n\nThere was seating available around the bar with two standalone tables and three booths tucked into the walls. The booths contained orange sofa seating and each contained varying artifacts including Phillak skulls and hookah pipes, and the booth frequented by bounty hunter Caij Vanda had blasters hung to the wall, an assortment of weapons, an additional Clone Trooper helmet plus bounty hunter helmets and B1 droid heads presented as trophies.\n\nA stage in the corner of the saloon provided an area for entertainment, complete with a sound desk and a rudimentary lighting system. The DJ droid DD-EC and musician Ashe Javi eventually performed there with Javi describing the acoustics of the venue as wonky but found that the sound was to her liking.\n\nA lobby between the bar and kitchen contained serving utensils, drinking vessels, GNK power droids and was decorated with a brown, orange, and light blue circular rug. The area also provided access to a small storage room in which the Mirialan Moran stored some belongings and a view of the kitchen area which was stocked with various cooking utensils and ovens.\n\nThis level also provided access to the refreshers which contained three cubicles, a hand dryer, washing sinks, dirty mirrors, and an additional GNK unit. A post on the wall stated that the sale and use of death sticks was prohibited.\n\nThe area also led to a staircase down to Dritus's quarters, with hidden access to a vast network of smugglers' tunnels. Within Dritus' quarters were items retained from his prior adventures including Cere Junda's hallikset, Cal Kestis' Bracca scrapper outfit, and a collection of Dritus' red and silver flight suits. There was also a workbench, power generators, a bunk bed, and a selection of flora collected from various planets. A private entrance was available also leading to the landing pad.\n\nLeading up to the second floor were two stone stairways situated on either side of the bar. The walls leading up were decorated with further colored drapes and posters, including one advertising the maintenance services of Zygg Soza. The upstairs balcony level had additional seating and tables which offered a clearer view of the bar area and aquarium which was eventually maintained by the Sakavian Skoova Stev.",

A poster on the wall depicted the Trontoshell of Dredger Gorge in its natural habitat. A smaller room was cleared to host a Holotactics table run by Bhima Ook and Tulli Mu.\n\nAnother stone stairwell led to the rooftop area. The area was home to a large garden area with four plots to plant seeds and was managed by Pili Walde. Across the area were spare planting pots, shelving units, and work areas. A small rock formation and water fountain could be found in one corner. Access to the turbine roof could be found here due to the overgrown roots forming a vertical pathway.",

        "content": "# Greedo - First shot at Solo[]\n\nGreedo fired at the guards, though the blast bounced off from the transparisteel windows. This gave Solo an idea, leading him to call another group of guards for medical assistance, call Chewbacca for backup and break one of the windows with Ovan's plasma cutter. The guards then arrived in a medshuttle and Solo stunned the driver, allowing them to escape and rendezvous with Chewbacca. Once they used a landspeeder to return to the Falcon, Solo had Greedo look for a hydrospanner, only for him to be left on Corellia as the Falcon flew away. Luckily, Greedo was picked up by Khel Tanna and her crew aboard their starship before they left for Graves' planetoid Mollo Tanka. Once they reached the planetoid, they found Solo and Chewbacca being chased by Graves' guards, including the bounty hunter Krrsantan. The crew then fired on the guards and brought the smuggler and Wookiee aboard before taking off from Mollo Tanka. As Solo expressed his gratitude, Greedo punched the smuggler for leaving him stranded on Corellia. Solo then led the crew back to the shop on Antillion where they found the urn, for which they would share the reward. However, once they reached the shop, they found that the urn was gone. Chewbacca then realized that Ovan had been an imposter and had faked being unconscious to make off with the urn and the Falcon. Solo then revealed that he had placed a tracker on the conman as insurance. Once they left Antillion, Greedo informed Tanna that the tracker led to the Benelex Marshal Service Headquarters on Paqualis III. After landing on a nearby platform, the crew split up, with Greedo, Chewbacca, and Ooris Bynar retrieving the imposter, a wanted criminal named Corbus Tyra, while Solo, Tanna, T'onga, and Akko stayed on the ship. As they brought Tyra aboard, Chewbacca was blasted and arrested by Marshal Buck Vancto. Solo tried to stop the crew from leaving, to which Greedo intervened and shot Solo in the chest.\n\nSolo did survive, though he was left unconscious. Despite Greedo wishing to finish him off, the crew instead dropped him off on Escalan before leaving to retrieve the Falcon. With Tyra's help, they found the ship at an Imperial Impound Facility on Iakar. Sneaking into the facility along with T'onga and Tyra, Greedo created a diversion while the crew fought their way toward the Falcon. Once they had the ship, they fled the facility and regrouped on an asteroid. Tyra then opened the compartment on the ship where he had stored the urn, only to find that it was gone. Upon learning that the urn was now in the possession of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Tanna's crew gave up and decided to go their separate ways. After cheating in a game of Sabacc, Greedo won ownership of the Falcon. Following this, he left to celebrate in Chalmun's Cantina, only to be found by Solo, Chewbacca and an escaped prisoner named Phaedra. Upon being interrogated, Greedo told them the urn was stored in Tarkin's office on Coruscant and that the Falcon was in a docking bay in Mos Entha. Solo then punched Greedo and left him unconscious in the street as he and his crew left to retrieve the Falcon. Sometime later, Greedo was met by Tyra, who supplied him with burnt Ronto meat to pass off to Jabba as D'Naran's ashes. Despite Jabba's suspicions, the ploy worked and Greedo received the reward. He then met back up with Tyra, who told Greedo that he wanted to tie up loose ends since he still had a score to settle with Solo.",

        "content": "# O1-MG - Nosy gambler[]\n\nO1-MG was a protocol droid with a penchant for gambling who used his math probability programming to determine the odds of winning hands at the holographic card game Eclipse. During the year 34 ABY, O1-MG was on the planet Cantonica, playing Eclipse in the Coruscant Hotel and Casino in the city of Canto Bight. The game, hosted by a Zabrak dealer, contained three other players: an Ithorian, a Twi'lek, and the human slicer known simply as DJ.\n\nWhen DJ was given the game choice of \"hit\" or \"stand,\" with the dealer choosing to stand, DJ decided to hit. Believing DJ to be making a mistake, O1-MG advised that DJ stand instead and gave DJ the odds of his success with his current play style. Even with the dealer in agreement, DJ ignored them and lost with a notable lack of interest in what O1-MG referred to as \"the gross global product of a small but relatively thriving Middle Rim planet.\" O1-MG's nagging annoyed the Twi'lek player into leaving the table.\n\nO1-MG was further perturbed by DJ's mannerisms when the slicer brazenly tipped a waitress with a third of his chips before giving the dealer the rest, save for one. Unbeknownst to all present, DJ was hacking the Eclipse table with a virus where the more money he lost, the more he would eventually win.\n\nShortly after, Canto Bight Police detectives Oosha Choi and Pol Ipol arrived at the table to interrogate DJ while playing the game themselves. With the Ithorian having left too, Choi pressed O1-MG to leave in order to have DJ to himself. After a failed protest, O1-MG left the table, muttering to himself as he walked.\n\n",

He first appeared in 1983 in the final film of the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.\n\nDeclan Mulholland was cast as Jabba in the unfinished scene from the original Star Wars, in which he was a rotund human dressed in a shaggy fur coat, but the scene was cut as George Lucas wanted to depict Jabba as an alien creature, but the special-effects technology of the time was not up to the task of replacing Mulholland. The scene, with a CGI Jabba, was eventually added to the Special Edition of Episode IV when a previously unfinished scene was restored to the film.\n\nFor Return of the Jedi, Jabba was portrayed by puppeteers Toby Philpott, David Barclay, and Mike Edmonds, and voiced by Larry Ward. Ward had previously provided Greedo's Huttese lines in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Jabba's lines in Huttese were scripted by sound engineer Ben Burtt before filming, so that the puppeteers moved Jabba's mouth accordingly.\n\nDuring postproduction Burtt edited Ward's already deep voice to make it as deep as possible, and mixed the words with rumble-like tones using a subharmonic generator, plus the slurpy sound of fondled pasta in a bowl. Jabba's burps were provided by sound engineer Howie Hammerman, notorious for his loud belches when drinking soda. Jabba's slimy sound was primarily made using a bowl of melted cheese.\n\nIn 1999, he appeared in the first chapter of the prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and made several appearances in the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the film, where he was voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. George Lucas originally placed off-limits the possibility of using Jabba in the series when writer Henry Gilroy was writing the show bible, but by the time of the next meeting, Lucas changed his mind, and Jabba was allowed to be used in both The Clone Wars film and the subsequent TV show. Guillermo del Toro was set to direct a Star Wars film on Jabba's rise to power and eventual fall.\n\nIn 2024, he appeared in Star Wars Outlaws, where he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.\n\nCrime lord Azmorigan was modeled after early concept art of Jabba the Hutt originally for Return of the Jedi.\n\nBetween May, 2016 and mid-2023, the Databank entry for Jabba on StarWars.com listed \"Hutt, B'omarr Monk\" as his species.\n\n",

During the year 34 ABY, O1-MG was a participant in a game of Eclipse along with a man known as \"DJ,\" who bet aggressively. Perturbed by DJ's play style and uncaring attitude towards his losses, O1-MG attempted to help DJ by presenting him with the mathematical odds with his heavy betting. DJ ignored the droid, and O1-MG was eventually forced to leave the table by the police detectives Oosha Choi and Pol Ipol, an act O1-MG considered rude.\n\nUnwilling to let things go, O1-MG located DJ's apartment and ransacked it: O1-MG uncovered a data file containing information about a \"Denel Strench\"\u2014a made-up being with the reputation of a dangerous gangster whom DJ created\u2014and accidentally downloaded the file into his core system, replacing a part of himself with Strench's identity. As Strench, O1-MG created havoc for DJ. First, he nearly got DJ killed by the arms dealer Flestic Crupp, and later forced DJ to get himself arrested in order to avoid being beaten to a pulp by the Vesustrian resort security team.\n\nAfter revealing himself to DJ, O1-MG's vindictive game came to an end when he was discovered by Choi and Ipol. When the droid refused to surrender, the detectives blasted him apart.\n\n",

However, Strench was a fabrication formulated by DJ to be used as an asset when needed. O1-MG accidentally downloaded the file into his core, and the detailed biography was powerful enough to replace part of O1-MG's own identity.\n\nAs Strench, O1-MG began to take his frustrations out on DJ, first by releasing the Rodian arms dealer Flestic Crupp from prison and telling him where to find DJ. As it happened, Crupp was tracked down and arrested on the suspicion of committing a crime that he did not commit, which then led back to Strench, whose last living associate was DJ. Crupp's vengeance on DJ was halted, though, by the security team of the Vesustrian resort led by Dezmoont.\n\nAfter that, O1-MG hacked Dezmoont's cam droid, using slicing knowledge taken from DJ's info banks, and watched as DJ scammed the Vesustrian Eclipse tables in the same way that he scammed the Coruscant tables. As Strench, O1-MG relayed the video back to Dezmoont, who decided to kill DJ himself, despite promising \"Strench\" to spare him simply so \"Strench\" could finish DJ personally.

Although Senya and Arcann will escape into hyperspace regardless, the choice will affect some dialogue in the next chapter.\n\nDuring Eternal Throne Chapter I: Wrath and Ruin, player must choose elect to either aid Senya in healing Arcann or refuse to assist her, an important decision that determines Senya and Arcann's ultimate fates.

With her dying breath, she asks to speak to Valkorion once more, at which point the Immortal Emperor soothes her with a lullaby he sang to her in the past on Aivela's Crest, one she had never forgotten. She then asks Valkorion why he had ignored his children in their attempts to gain approval from him, but the Immortal Emperor merely replies that she knows why before vanishing. The player can either let Senya go peacefully or taunt her with a dark side dialogue, promising to tell Arcann of her final moments before ending him, in which case Senya will curse the Outlander for being the child Valkorion always wanted.\n\nDuring Eternal Throne Chapter VI: The Dragon's Maw if player previously denied Senya aid and Arcann was not healed, he will attack the player in a final attempt at vengeance, but will be struck down.\n\nDuring Eternal Throne Chapter VIII: End Times if Senya and Arcann were previously killed, Lana Beniko will continued to accompany player through the second half of the chapter in their place.\n\nDuring Eternal Throne Chapter IX: The Eternal Throne if Senya and Arcann were previously killed, Lana Beniko and Theron Shan will accompany the player to the Eternal Throne instead. After freeing Arcann's spirit from Valkorion's control, player can win over Vaylin by either assuring her that Senya suffered and screamed endlessly during her death, or lie and claim that Senya begged Valkorion to kill the Outlander before dying, causing Vaylin to turn against him out of spite. Senya's spirit will also make an appearance inside Outlander's mind, joining the spirits of Vaylin and Arcann to help destroy Valkorion once and for all.\n\n",

She spent some time overseeing the treasury ship Gilded Star. In 3636 BBY the Eternal Empire made a contact with the larger galaxy, leading a series of raids meant to test the strength of the Core Worlds. Following one such attack on Korriban, it was publicly proclaimed that prince Thexan was killed during the fighting. Senya watched her son's funeral on the public broadcast, the only way she could now see her family.\n\nLater that year, Valkorion was assassinated at the hands of an Outlander captured during one such raid, and Arcann took his father's Eternal Throne, proclaiming himself the new Eternal Emperor, with Vaylin as his High Justice. Arcann launched a full-scale invasion of the galaxy, claiming it a retaliation for the Outlander's crime. During the Occupation of Denon a crew serving under captain Koth Vortena refused to massacre civilian rioters on Denon and deserted, and Senya was assigned to hunt them down, spending months attempting to capture the deserters.\n\nDuring that time she met Sith Lord Lana Beniko who was looking for the whereabouts of the Outlander, exchanging what information she could with her. Senya later became sympathetic to Beniko's cause, seeing how oppressive and cruel Arcann's rule had become, but the final straw for her was the Scion massacre, when Arcann ordered the Zakuulan Knights to kill the Scions of Zakuul who served alongside them. Horrified by her son's actions, Senya felt that the Knights had lost their honor when they decided to follow that order instead of rebelling. She abandoned the Knights and went to find for a way to stop the cruel rule of her children.\n\n",

Aware of Koth's prior history with Senya, Lana contacted her in secret, asking her to come to their hiding place and provide assistance in escaping their pursuers. Senya went to Lana's coordinates in the Endless Swamp of Zakuul, where the fugitives have found and partially repaired the legendary vessel called the Gravestone. Senya arrived on her speeder bike just as Beniko and the Outlander were fighting off skytrooper forces and helped them hold their ground against Zauulan Knights.\n\nWhen another wave of attackers was dealt with, Koth Vortena rushed to their help and upon seeing Senya, immediately showed his distrust of her, refusing to let her aboard. However, there was no time for argument with more pursuers on their way and Senya worked together with Lana to raised the Gravestone from the swamp using the Force. As everyone got onboard and the vessel left the atmosphere, the Eternal Fleet arrived to intercept them, only for the Outlander to fire the Gravestone's omnicannon, destroying more than two dozen Eternal Fleet warships in a single shot and enabling the Gravestone to jump into Hyperspace. Hostilities soon erupted on the bridge as Koth and Senya's past history prevented them from working towards a common goal.\n\nThe ship was able to get a short distance away before the Gravestone hyperdrive failed. After informing the Outlander that they were going to Asylum, Senya responded to Koth's hostility with insistence that her pursuit of him was justified, considering his status as a deserter. With their argument going nowhere, Senya left the bridge to wander and explore the ship, going down into the deeper part of the ship and finding an enigmatic monolith in an area called \"the Dark Sanctuary\". The Outlander found her there, and the two had a brief conversation, in which Senya formally introduced herself. The Gravestone managed to limp to the shadowport and dock as the Asylum, where Vortena's crew of Zakuulan exiles joined him to work on the ship, prompting a sarcastic remark from Senya who was not told of their company beforehand.\n\nSenya then went to meet with the Scions of Zakuul who had a secret enclave on the Asylum, asking the Outlander to join her there later. She waited at the hidden entrance to the enclave until the Outlander arrived in the company of Lana's Bodyguard droid HK-55. Senya opened the secret entrance, upon entering which the HK was hit by an electromagnetic pulse that disabled him and wiped his short-term memory. Senya explained to the confused Outlander that the Scions, led by Heskal, wanted to meet with only the two of them to determine whether they would join the Outlander's rebellion against Arcann. Heskal explained that for some reason the Outlander remained a blind spot in the Scions' visions and they had to understand the Outlander's role in the events to come before any talk of cooperation.\n\nSenya joined the Outlander in persevering through the Scions' trials, to better understand the person who intended to kill her son and daughter. They were engaged in combat by Scions and had their intentions questioned by Heskal, who insisted that Arcann and Vaylin had to die for their slaughter of the Scions. Still unable to perceive the Outlander's fate, Heskal knocked out Senya and engaged the Outlander one-on-one. The Outlander emerged victorious and stood over a defeated Heskal, and Senya pleaded not to harm Heskal, insisting that they needed the support of the Scions. At that moment, the sanctuary was stormed by Hk-55, Lana Beniko, Koth Vortena and his crew, who demanded that the Scions stand down.\n\nHeskal ordered his men to out away their lightsabers and asked the Outlander a final question about their intentions for the galaxy after Arcann's defeat. After the Outlander gave the answer, Heskal shocked everyone by revealing that the reason why the Scions could not see the Outlander future was because Valkorion had survived within their mind. The revelation excited Koth, who believed that Valkorion's survival meant salvation for Zakuul, while Lana stated that the Emperor was a threat to all life everywhere. As the Outlander prepared to leave the enclave, Senya confessed her ulterior motive for including herself in the trials, revealing herself to be Arcann and Vaylin's mother.\n\n",

However, Vaylin followed her and launched an invasion of Voss, determined to kill all her family in one fell swoop. The Eternal Fleet met resistance from the Alliance forces and Senya was forced to contact Theron, Lana and the Alliance Commander, for help. The Commander and Theron Shan traveled to Senya's location, but before they could talk, Vaylin addressed them through a Skytrooper holocomm, taunting her family and ordering the Eternal Fleet to bombard the Shrine in an attempt to kill them all.\n\nSenya asked the Alliance to hold off Zakuulan forces so that the healing ritual could be completed and rushed to her son after they agreed. Lana Beniko and a team of Mandalorians held off Eternal Empire forces from pouring into the Shrine, while the Commander and Theron Shan collapsed the tunnel behind them to stop the ones already inside from reaching Senya's position. Senya herself battled and single-handedly defeated a host of Zakuulan Knights, but as it became clear that there was not enough time until their position was overwhelmed, Senya ordered the Mystics to take her strength to heal her son. The Mystics complied and transferred her strength to Arcann, healing his injuries and mending his broken spirit, though this act left Senya comatose.\n\nArcann awoke confused and, witnessing his mother's lifeless body, fled the Shrine back to his shuttle, believing her dead. Alliance forces soon found Senya and transferred her to Odessen, where Doctor Juvard Illip Oggurobb stabilized her condition, and began looking for possible treatments. During the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin Alliance operatives infiltrated Vaylin's Palace of the Eternal Dragon on Zakuul in an attempt to take her down, while Arcann and his loyalists assaulted the Palace with a similar goal. Vaylin escaped the carnage, and Arcann thanked the Commander for saving his mother and offered to join the Alliance to atone for his crimes. Arcann joined the Alliance on Odessen, while Vaylin returned to Nathema, where Jarak helped her break free from her mental condition. Sensing her daughter break free of her last restrictions, Senya awoke from her coma, with Arcann at her side.\n\n",

Joining the ranks of the Knights of Zakuul, she rose to become a member of the personal guard of the Immortal Emperor Valkorion and caught his interest. The two began a romantic affair, and Tirall bore three children\u2014the twins Thexan and Arcann, and her daughter Vaylin. Senya grew troubled by Valkorion's indifference to his children, which culminated with him locking Vaylin on Nathema and subjecting her to mental conditioning. Senya attempted to rescue her daughter to no avail and later attempted to run away with the children, but they refused to leave, calling her weak. Senya abandoned her family, but not the Empire, taking assignments on the fringes of Zakuulan space. Seeing her family only in public broadcasts, she eventually learned that Thexan was killed during the raids into the Core Worlds. Not long afterwards, Valkorion was assassinated and Arcann claimed his Eternal Throne, launching Eternal Empire conquest of the galaxy and enacting a Scion massacre, which was the last straw for Senya and caused her to oppose the tyranny of her children.\n\nAfter the Outlander blamed for killing Valkorion was rescued from carbonite by Senya's associate Lana Beniko, she was asked to provide assistance in their escape. Senya joined Beniko's group in the Endless Swamp, where she helped raise the legendary Gravestone from the mud, escaping on the ship alongside Zakuulan defector Koth Vortena. The group traveled to the shadowport of Asylum, where Senya introduced the Outlander to the Scions of Zakuul and revealed her relationship to the Emperor and his High Justice. She later accompanied the Outlander back to Zakuul on a mission to find and recruit the Lady of Sorrows, returning with her to Asylym shorly before Arcann's Eternal Fleet launched an attack. Senya helped defend the Gravestone against skytrooper assault and engaged her daughter in a Lightsaber duel, during which Vaylin revealed to her that it was Arcann who killed Thexan. Escaping from the Eternal Fleet on the Gravestone, Senya traveled with the rest to Odessen, where she joined Lana Beniko's Alliance to oppose the Eternal Empire. Senya participated in Alliance operations on Zakuul and Vandin, providing valuable information on the Eternal Empire. She joined an assault party that boarded an Eternal Fleet warship in an attempt to control the ships' GEMINI captains, which inadvertently resulted in SCORPIO taking control of the Eternal Throne.\n\nIn the resulting battle of Odessen Senya rescued wounded Arcann from his Eternal Flagship and fled from the Alliance forces determined to redeem him. An attempt to contact loyalist Zakuulan Knights turned disastrous when Vaylin intercepted the call and massacred the Knights on Ord Mantell, with Senya herself barely escaping her daughter. Senya later brought Arcann to Voss, where Vaylin again found her and launched an Invasion of Voss before Voss healing ritual could fully help Arcann. Desperate, Senya contacted the Alliance for help and begged the Commander to hold off Vaylin's forces and allow Arcann to be redeemed. However, there was still not enough time and Senya ordered Voss Mystics to give her strength to her son, which healed Arcann, but left Senya comatose. She remained on Odessen under watch, waking up only when Vaylin found a way to break her conditioning and launched an assault on Odessen. Senya joined her son, who had been redeemed and joined the Alliance, in defending the Gravestone from the ground assault and confronted Vaylin together with the Alliance Commander, who struck her a killing blow. To stop the rampage of the leaderless Eternal Fleet, Senya and Arcann accompanied the Alliance Commander to Zakuul, allowing them to seize the Eternal Throne and pacify the rampaging Fleet. However, Valkorion's spirit then attempted to take over the Commander's body and Senya and Arcann used Dramath's holocron to enter Commander's mind and aid them in finally destroying Valkorion, ending his millennia-long existence.\n\n",

Senya suggested asking Valkorion directly, though the Outlander rejected the notion of being merely Valkorion's mouthpiece. Koth and Lana soon began to argue over whether Valkorion was benevolent or a monster, each arguing that they knew more about him than the other. Senya interjected that she knew him better than anyone else, which only made the situation awkward given her unintended implication. The argument was interrupted by HK-55, who relayed a message from Lana's astromech droid T7-O1 on Zakuul, informing them that the information broker known as \"Lady of Sorrows\" wished to establish a dialogue with the Gravestone computers.\n\nSenya explained to everyone that the Lady of Sorrows was an information broker who had remained out of the reach of Zakuulan law and volunteered to guide the Outlander through the Old World district of Zakuul, where the Lady was known to operate. Upon returning to Zakuul in a shuttle, Senya puzzled the Outlander by singing a song, in spite of the fact that they're headed into hostile territory. After meeting up with T7-O1, Senya went to meet with her contact Reg in the Platform 6 cantina. However, the Knights were not welcome in the Old World and Reg set Heralds of Zildrog led by Aitan Brewgs on Senya, who managed to hold her own against the three attackers until the Outlander arrived and helped her to finish them off.\n\nAfterwards, Senya confronted Reg, who explained that the Heralds made a deal with Arcann; in exchange for the Knights keeping out of the Old World, the Heralds would keep crime levels down. Senya demanded to know where to find the Lady of Sorrows but Reg refused, so Senya had to use the Force to demand answers of him, and Reg gave up, pointing Senya and the Outlander to one of the Lady's business partners, Mona Gale. Senya and the Outlander found Gale at the Market Station, taking bets on Arena Grand fights, which Senya found brutal and barbaric. Senya asked Gale on hos to contact the Lady just as a public broadcast from Arcann labeled Senya as the Outlander's accomplice.\n\nThis unintentionally gave them some street clout, as Gale admitted that she didn't know how to contact the Lady, but suggested they go to the Heralds in Breaktown to get a meeting with her. Senya and the Outlander traveled to Breaktown, but just as they were about to enter the Heralds' lair, they were interrupted by Koth Vortena, who learned of their destination from T7-O1 and decided to follow. Koth insisted that the Heralds' leader, The Exalted, detested Knights and wouldn't talk to Senya, arguing that he should accompany the Outlander instead. The two began arguing, with Senya insisting that she could simply strongarm the Exalted into compliance, and Koth claiming that as an average Zakuulan, he could reason with them better.\n\nThe Outlander made their decision and took one of them to meet with the Exalted, while the other was ambushed and brought to the Lady directly. The Exalted refused to cooperate and was about to order his Heralds to open fire on the Outlander, but was interrupted by a holocall from Lady's Nautolan aide Thea, who told them that the Lady wished to meet both the Exalted and the Outlander at the Razor. The parties converged on the base of operations of the Lady of Sorrows, who was revealed to be an advanced Artificial intelligence calling herself SCORPIO. She killed the Exalted and his Heralds and agreed to accompany the Outlander, departing Zakuul alongside Koth and Senya.\n\n",

        "content": "# Senya Tirall - Taking refuge[]\n\nReturning to Odessen, the Alliance learned that a portion of the Eternal Fleet remained under Arcann's control and that SCORPIO revealed to him the location of the Alliance base. With Eternal Fleet on its way, the Commander left behind some forces in case of a ground assault, while taking the fight to Arcann from the Gravestone. As the battle of Odessen began, Beniko determined that the only way to ensure safely of the Alliance was to annihilate Arcann's Eternal Flagship and Senya volunteered to join the boarding party, determined to face her children. Infiltrating the Eternal Flagship, Senya, Lana and the Commander were spotted by Vaylin on the security cameras, who contacted them through a loudspeaker and revealed that Arcann's was on the ship's bridge and that she only cared about facing her mother alone. Senya urged the Commander and Lana to deal with Arcann, while she went after Vaylin.\n\nThe Commander confronted and defeated Arcann on the bridge, crushing him under a pile of debris as SCORPIO took control of what remained of the Eternal Fleet to fire on the Flagship, attempting to eliminate Arcann and the Commander in one fell swoop. Senya arrived soon after the Outlander left the bridge and pulled Arcann from under the rubble, lamenting her inability to save him. She was then interrupted by the arrival of Vaylin and offered both her children to come back to her. Vaylin refused, still angry at Senya for abandoning her and launched herself at her mother, but Arcann Force-pushed his sister away, saving Senya and leaving Vaylin feeling betrayed. Senya took it as a sign of hope for both of her children and urged Vaylin to come along with her and Arcann. Before Vaylin could answer, falling debris forcing her to retreat and flee back to Zakuul. Senya then took Arcann into his personal shuttle and contacted the Alliance, informing them that she was taking Arcann to redeem him, before fleeing into hyperspace.\n\nReturning to Zakuul, Vaylin allied herself with SCORPIO and claimed the Etenal Throne. As one of her first acts as Empress of Zakuul, Vaylin declared a bounty on her mother, pursuing every lead herself. Arcann fell into coma from injuries sustained during the battle, and Senya hooked him into a system of tubes and vials keeping him alive, but could not acquire medical equipment and supplies necessary to heal him on her own. With nowhere to turn to, Senya was unexpectedly contacted by the remaining Scions of Zakuul, who refused to meet with her directly, but instead arranged for Senya to meet with a group of Zakuul Knights who had turned against Vaylin.\n\nAfraid that Vaylin might disband or even destroy their order, this group of Knights awaited Senya on Ord Mantell, where they could provide healing supplies for Arcann. Cautious, Senya landed her stolen shuttle several kilometers away from the meeting spot and make the final approach on foot, in the cover of the night. Upon reaching the camp's coordinates, Senya found only the bodies of dead Knights lying in the puddles of spilled rhydonium, and a small wooden toy, the ony that Vaylin herself made as child and kept in her possessions even in Nathema's Sanitarium. After Senya realized that Vaylin became aware of the dissident Knights and slaughtered them before she even arrived, Vaylin herself appeared from the shadows, using Force-lightning to ignite the rhydonium streams.\n\nVaylin used the Force to snatch Senya's Lightsaber pike from her hands and attacked, while Senya grabbed one of the fallen Knight's lightsabers and defended herself from her daughter's attack. The two dueled among the flames and exchanged taunts, with Vaylin calling her mother afraid while Senya implied that her daughter was taking orders from SCORPIO. The duel ended when Vaylin launched Senya's lightsaber pike at her and hit the Hyperdrive of a damaged shuttle, which exploded, giving Senya a chance to escape in confusion. She ran back to her shuttle on foot and quickly took off from Ord Mantell after making sure Vaylin was not following her.\n\n",

First appearing in Chapter V: From the Grave, she becomes a companion in the following Chapter VI: Asylum before departing and becoming unavailable at the end of Chapter XVI: The Battle of Odessen. Early on in the Knights of the Eternal Throne player has to choose between allowing Senya to heal Arcann or insist on the intention to kill him. In the Light Side option, Senya later rejoins as a companion after awakening from her coma, as does Arcann. In the Dark Side option, Senya is killed on Voss and becomes permanently unavailable, though players can still reclaim her from a terminal on Odessen for use in non-storyline purposes.\n\nSenya featured prominently in Betrayed cinematic trailer, released between the end of the Fallen Empire and the release of the Eternal Throne expansions. Her face in the trailer was noticeably different from her in-game model, which was changed with the release of the Eternal Throne to more closely match her cinematic appearance. Senya uses a telescopic lightsaber pike in the trailer, and the item \"Senya's Lightsaber Pike\" was later made available from Cartel Market packs, however she uses a normal lightsaber in the game. Betrayed trailer ends on a cliffhanger as Vaylin attacks Senya, the full story of the events on Ord Mantell including Senya's escape were laid out in A Mother's Hope, a short story by Drew Karpyshyn published on the game's website.\n\n",

        "content": "# Senya Tirall - Asylum and start of the Alliance[]\n\nBack on the Asylum, Heskal called the Outlander for another meeting at the Scions hideout, where it was revealed that he gave up their location to Arcann, acting in accordance with a prophecy. The Eternal Fleet emerged from hyperspace and opened fire on the shadowport, while the Gravestone remained grounded by Asylum docking clamps. Lana Beniko and Koth's crew led by Len Parvek held their own against the skytroopers, but when Vaylin herself arrived at the scene and personally confronted the Outlander, Senya rushed to aid the defenders. She first dispatched a Zakuulan Knight going after Koth's crew before telekinetically tossing the Outlander away before Vaylin could land a single blow.\n\nSeya then urged Beniko to follow the Outlander and free the Gravestone, staying behind to deal with her daughter herself. After a brief exchange of words Vaylin attacked her and the two engaged in a Lightsaber duel, as Senya attempted to reason with her daughter but failed. Ultimately, Senya managed to disarm Vaylin and had her at her mercy, she but unable to land a finishing strike. This amused Vaylin, who revealed to her mother that it was Arcann who killed Thexan in cold blood, a revelation that shook Senya to the core. Senya managed to gather her wits enough to rejoin her allies aboard the Gravestone after it was released from docking clamps and fled Asylum. The ship escaped from the Eternal Fleet to hyperspace, and the Outlander collapsed from injuries sustained in a duel against Arcann.\n\nThe Battle of Asylum served as a rallying cry for those who wished to oppose Arcann, and Lana called her multiple contacts to gather on the remove planet Odessen, where she laid the foundations of an Alliance against the Eternal Empire. The Gravestone arrived to Odessen, where Senya noted that it was unwise to leave SCORPIO with access to the ship's systems. Elements from the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire threw their support behind the new Alliance, establishing a base on Odessen. Senya intended to sing in a new Alliance cantina, but was put off by Koth again and went outside to contemplate, where she was later approached by the Outlander.\n\nSenya congratulated the new Alliance Commander on the progress that was made, while musing about how many Scions followed Heskal to their deaths, despite knowing that the visions were not infallible. She also revealed the circumstances of Thexan's death at Arcann's were told to her by Vaylin and became reaffirmed in her confidence that her children had to be stopped by any cost and that she had to live with the consequences. Some time later Arcann, trying to lure the Outlander and the Gravestone out of hiding, ordered the Eternal Fleet reprisal bombardments of five inhabited worlds, reducing them to rubble and causing millions of deaths. Senya was appalled by this tragedy and insisted to the Alliance leadership that they must make her children answer for their crimes.\n\nThe new Alliance made several bold strikes against the Eternal Empire, which attracted new members and volunteers. The Commander recruited Kaliyo Djannis, an experienced anarchist known as \"Firebrand\", who survived on Zakuul for two years, and assisted Republic Special Forces Division Havoc Squad under Major Aric Jorgan in wire-tapping a Zakuulan listening post in the Eternal Swamp, a missing for which Senya and other Alliance members provided a major distraction. Combining the information from the two sources allowed SCORPIO to reveal the existence of the GEMINI frequency, by the means of which Arcann controlled the Eternal Fleet.\n\nThe Alliance planned an attack on the Hyperwave relay station hidden ten kilometers beneath the Spire on Zakuul and connecting the Eternal Throne to the Eternal Fleet, sending the Havoc Squad and Kaliyo Djannis on the mission, one of them providing a diversion for the other's main objective. Bearing animosity for Firebrand's anarchist attacks, Senya was against Kaliyo's involvement in the operation. Unfortunately, the Commander went missing and was unable to join on the mission, so the Alliance had no choice but to proceed regardless. In the process the contact with the infiltration team was lost, prompting the diversion team to attempt a rescue. At that point, the Spire went into full lockdown with no transmissions coming in or out, making any rescue attempt all but impossible and leaving the Alliance leadership no choice but to wait.\n\n",

        "content": "# Senya Tirall - The Emperor's family[]\n\nSenya Tirall was born on the Wild Space planet of Zakuul, the capital of the Eternal Empire ruled by Immortal Emperor Valkorion. When her Force-sensitivity was discovered, she joined the ranks of the Knights of Zakuul and eventually earned a place in Emperor Valkorion's elite guard. Senya didn't hesitate to speak her mind, speaking out against replacing human soldiers in military positions with skytroopers, catching the Emperor's interest. Two years later, Valkorion and Senya become romantically involved, eventually marrying and bearing his children, giving birth to twins Arcann and Thexan.\n\nDespite Senya showering them with love, her sons gave none in return, seeking to impress their father, who seemed content to ignore them in turn. Their third child and only daughter, Vaylin, was a trouble from the very start, being so powerful that she made furniture move with the Force while still in the womb. As a toddler, Vaylin tore droids apart and one time, when a guard dropped a ball she tossed, Vaylin crippled him. Senya spent as much time as she could with her daughter and the two shared many happy moments, but Vaylin preferred to do even mundane tasks using Telekinesis instead of her hands. Eventually during a sparring exercise Vaylin gave way to her rage, crushing several Zakuul Knights inside their own armor.\n\nSenya went to Valkorion and pleaded with him to help his children, but the Emperor's solution was merely to cage Vaylin's mind, locking her power away along with most of who she was, and continuing to ignore Thexan and Arcann. He took Vaylin to Nathema, a blighted world devoid of the Force and locked her in the Sanitarium, where she underwent brutal mental and physical torture at the hands of Nathema Zealots, while Anomid scientist Jarak worked her on her mental conditioning, transforming Vaylin from a sweet but troubled child into a psychopath devoid of empathy. Sensing her daughter's suffering home on Zakuul, Senya decided to get Vaylin away from Nathema.\n\nA shuttle delivered her to Sanitarium, where she found Vaylin unconscious and carried her to the landing platform. There, her path was blocked by six of the Nathema Zealots and after Vaylin opened her eyes, Senya ordered her to stay back, while she took great care to knock out all six Zealots without killing them. Senya then asked Vaylin to come with her, but the look in her daughter's eyes was filled with hate, with Vaylin blaming her mother for her suffering. Valkorion himself then emerged from the Sanitarium and ordered several Knights of Zakuul to restrain Senya and take her away, while taking Vaylin with him back into Sanitarium.\n\nDeciding that her children were not safe around Valkorion, Senya attempted to run away with them, but the children idolized their father and refused to leave, calling their own mother weak. Even as children and with Vaylin's powers locked away, the three of them were more powerful than Senya, so she was forced to leave alone. Valkorion didn't even try to stop her, although years later he privately admitted to the Commander that he made a mistake in letting her go. Senya transferred to the Knights' enforcement division and took assignments at the fringes of the Eternal Empire.\n\n",

Strained for funds, the Commander agreed to the plan and accompanied Gault to Vandin along with Lana Beniko, Theron Shan, Senya Tirall and SCORPIO. There Gault brought in his partner Vette and identity slicer Dretcher, who forging the identity of High Justice Vaylin for Senya Tirall, who provided a genetic match and required character knowledge and would take SCORPIO aboard as her \"attache droid\". They would access the bridge and lower security, allowing Vette, Gault and the Commander to get onboard and detonate a warhead inside the vault, while Shan and Beniko would pilot a tanker to siphon off the vaporized previous metals.\n\nWhen the Gilded Star docked with the skyhook its annual resupply, Senya, disguised as her own daughter, escorted SCORPIO past the guards onto the bridge, where SCORPIO took control of the ship's functions, enabling the Commander and Gault to plant a warhead inside the vault, which upon detonation vaporized its valuables, while leaving everything outside the vault safe and intact. The vault's entire content of precious metals was then pumped into the tanker piloted by Lana Beniko and Theron Shan, where SCORPIO and Senya soon joined them. Those aboard the Gilded Star had to avoid the real Vaylin, but were picked up by Hylo Visz, with both ships safely returning to Odessen.\n\nThe celebration was interrupted by the return of Aric Jorgan and Kaliyo Djannis, who managed to escape Zakuul with a database on the GEMINI droids. Its analysis let SCORPIO reveal that the GEMINI droids were produced from a template called GEMINI Prime in a weapons factory on Darvannis. Senya identified Darvannis as one of the first worlds conquered by the Eternal Empire and a staging point for their invasion in the wider galaxy. After the Commander secured the Prime with the help of Mandalorians, SCORPIO determined that plugging the Prime into any of the warships in the Eternal Fleet would enable her to take over the entire network, and with it the Eternal Fleet. Senya noted that while infiltrating a ship inside a formation would be suicide, individual ships made cargo runs from the Core Worlds all the time and presented a much easier target. After SCORPIO located a lone warship scheduled to recharge its hyperdrive as their target, the Alliance leadership moved to intercept it.\n\nAs the Gravestone was traveled through hyperspace towards the Eternal Fleet warship's location, Senya advised the Alliance to expect massive swarms of skytroopers to rush the breach point as soon as they boarded the ship. Emerging from hyperspace, SCORPIO confused its targeting systems while Theron Shan piloted a shuttle inside its hangar, where Senya immediately noted the absence of skytroopers as suspicious. Inside, the GEMINI captain noted their presence and separated the Commander and SCORPIO from Lana, Senya and Theron. While making their way to a rendezvous point, the three found that the ship was transporting prisoners for Arcann to interrogate - Imperial Admiral Zasha Ranken, Republic Senator Tai Cordan and Zakuulan holostar-in-exile Malita Tal.\n\nSCORPIO apparently was destroyed in her attempt to override the GEMINI captain, and Lana send Senya to assist the Commander. Lana and Theron escorted the freed prisoners to the escape pods, as Senya and the Commander confronted and defeated the GEMINI captain on the ship's bridge. The GEMINI however, revealed their sabotage to Emperor Arcann and triggered the ship's self-destruct. One of three escape pods was destroyed and the Alliance could barely manage to escape the vessel's destruction in time and jump into hyperspace onboard the Gravestone. SCORPIO then contacted the Alliance and revealed that she faked her death, using the GEMINI network to transport herself to Zakuul, where she took control of the Eternal Throne.\n\n",

        "content": "# Senya Tirall - The end of Valkorion[]\n\nNo longer chained by her conditioning, Vaylin immediately launched an assault on Odessen, intending to wipe out the Alliance and her entire family. As the battle raged on multiple fronts, Senya and Arcann teamed up to protect the dry-docked Gravestone from the Vaylin's forces. When the Commander caught up with them, the mother and son pledged their support for the Alliance cause once more and offered to stand by the Commander's side against Vaylin. The Commander contacted Vaylin via a holo-call, successfully taunting her to abandon the safety of her flagship and travel to Odessen surface for a face-to-face confrontation. Holding an Alliance member hostage, Vaylin awaited on the Alliance landing platform as the Commander and her family arrived to stop her. Her power raging out of control, Vaylin killed her hostage and caused a massive Force Storm, leaving the Commander no choice but to strike her down. As Vaylin lay dead, Senya and Arcann lamented her loss, but were relieved that the conflict was over.\n\nHowever, Vaylin's death left the Eternal Throne empty, leading the GEMINI captains to revert to their basic programming and commanding the Eternal Fleet to bombard inhabited worlds indiscriminately. The Alliance leadership boarded the Gravestone and departed for Zakuul, intending to end the threat once and for all. Using upgrades from Iokath, the ship was able to breach the Eternal Fleet blockade, and Senya and Arcann volunteered to accompany Commander to the Eternal Throne. Together, they traveled down to surface in a boarding pod that landed in the Garden of Izax and made their way to the Spire as the Eternal Fleet burned Zakuul around them. After entering the Eternal Throne room, Arcann was taken aback at seeing his old Throne and lamented the death of millions he caused while holding it, while Senya assured him that he became a better man since then.\n\nThe Commander took the Throne and pacified the Fleet, but immediately afterwards Valkorion revealed his ultimate goal, assaulting the Commander for control of their body. Within the depth of their mind, the Commander fought back by locating the Dramath's holocron, which held power to destroy Valkorion once and for all. The Throne room was breached by the attacking skytroopers and mother and son held them off for a while, until Senya told Arcann to use the physical Holocron to join the Outlander in the fight against his father. Inside the Commander's mind, Arcann joined Vaylin's essence, which remained bound to Valkorion after her death.\n\nUsing the holocron to free her from Valkorion's control, Arcann and the Outlander convinced Vaylin to joined their side and attacked the Immortal Emperor. After toying with them for a while, Valkorion destroyed the holocron, but since his spirit was now bound to Vaylin's, the Commander used Vaylin's mental key phrase \"Kneel before the Dragon of Zakuul\" to rob him of his own strength. Overpowered and weakened, Valkorion watched as Senya joined her children in the Commander's mind and together the family watched the Immortal Emperor's final words and moments, until the Commander put a final end to his millennia-long existence. Back in the physical world, Senya congratulated the Commander on finally putting an end to Valkorion and opened a system-wide holochannel to announce the Alliance victory. The Commander then proclaimed the age of the Eternal Alliance, unifying the military of Zakuul and the Eternal Fleet with the cause of the Alliance, which Senya continued to be a part of.\n\n",

In response, Uksaris fired Ujaa, and just as Ujii followed his brother into the band, so did he follow his brother out, quitting promptly afterwards. The two were replaced by the Biths Loopa and Fodo respectively.\n\nUksaris would later write a narrative of the band's history titled Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio, featuring Ujii alongside other members of the band.\n\n",

Therefore, it is impossible to verify the canonical species of Tuko. However, the quest dialogue given by Muse indicated that Pytor Tuko was a male.

Despite this, it is apparent that Vader only took action with regard to this matter after Emperor Palpatine ordered Vader to \"get his battery\" after sensing the \"great disturbance in the Force\" caused by the Energizer Bunny.\n\nVader and the Energizer Bunny eventually met at a carbon-freezing facility at an undisclosed location, possibly Cloud City. Vader soon discovered that retrieving the Energizer Bunny's power cell would not be as easy as he had thought. He taunted the Energizer Bunny and tried to lure it to the dark side of the Force. It easily evaded the Sith Lord's attacks by spinning. Eventually Vader's lightsaber, which had been powered by allegedly inferior Supervolt power cells, died out.\n\nWith no apparent urgency, the Energizer Bunny exited the carbon-freezing chamber as the Dark Lord of the Sith screamed in frustration.\n\n",

Elinda's fans admired her voice, and the band at last attracted the attention of the local, powerful businessman Davik Kang, who invited them to play at his estate. Kang, however, was actually the head of the criminal organization the Exchange, and Elinda feared the consequences should Kang somehow be malcontent with her performance or should she even have dealings with him at all. Such was her apprehension that in spite of Uksaris's conviction that Kang's sponsorship was too grand of an opportunity to reject, Elinda abandoned the band altogether.\n\nWithout a singer, the Twisted Rancor Trio seemed to be at its end, but on the eve of the scheduled performance, Uksaris recruited Ashana as a replacement for her sister. By Uksaris's own admission, the plan was risky given Ashana's untested singing and the last minute recruitment without prior rehearsals, and should Ashana fail to live up to Elinda's reputation, the band could incur the notorious wrath of Kang, putting their lives in jeopardy. Uksaris, however, believed that the scheme was still worth the risks, hoping that should they succeed, Kang would sign them up on a great touring contract.\n\n",

These were the first tradechips to depict famous members of the Jedi Order. Much like sports tradechips, they contained small holograms of the Jedi depicted, biographical information, and vital statistics (though rather than races won and goals scored, the chips listed confirmed kills and midi-chlorian count.)\n\nThough Spotts' marketing manager Wil Jhonems claimed that the tradechips were intended to hold famous Jedi up as role models for young children, they were controversial at the time for several reasons. Firstly, such Jedi as Master Coleman Trebor felt that merchandising the Jedi was disrespectful towards the Force. Secondly, since the Jedi refused to cooperate with the production of this unlicensed merchandising by granting access to the Jedi Archives, many of the statistics were inaccurate. Yoda, for example, was identified as a Lannik rather than his true species, and given an inaccurate midi-chlorian count of four million. Trebor also pointed out that if the information had been accurate, the Jedi's enemies would have been able to use the information against them.\n\nThough the Jedi tried to halt production of the tradechips, Spotts intended to release a second set (with updated information) in the near future.\n\n",

Amidala suspected that Organa played the piece after remembering that she had once claimed Argala was her favorite of Naboo's music makers and also because he knew how homesick she was. At another point during the Clone Wars, Argala worked with fellow musicians Bongiovi, Augara Jowil and the Naboo Royal Advisory Council music Advisor Hela Brandes to persuade Beezar Pert, another famed composer, to come out of retirement for a charity concert. The concert was held in the Palace Plaza in the Naboo capital city of Theed and sold out, with all profits being used to support children orphaned by the Clone Wars on both sides of the conflict.\n\n",

        "content": "# Malinza Thanas - Personality and traits[]\n\nAt the age of four, Malinza Thanas was a spritely infant who enjoyed bouncing down stairwells and singing songs to herself. She loved her mother deeply and did not want her to leave for the Corellian sector. When Captison died, Thanas did not fully understand why her mother would not return to Bakura. As she grew up, she retained very few memories of either of her parents. Although Luke Skywalker blamed himself for Captison's death, Thanas did not, and harbored no resentment toward the Jedi Master. She did begin to despise the New Republic, however; she blamed them for Captison's passing and hated them for dragging Bakura into their struggles. It similarly vexed her that Bakura acquiesced so readily to their requests. To Thanas, the New Republic was a cruel mistress that held Bakura in chains and dragged it into wars and galactic affairs with no regard for the well-being of its people.\n\nAs a teenager, Thanas organized Freedom, a resistance movement, and began to actively protest against the New Republic and lobby for Bakura's independence. Her belief in the necessity of independence and autonomy extended to Freedom's principles as well; the organization made every effort to remain out of debt to others due to the members' belief that independence was a necessary element of objectivity. Thanas hoped to objectively evaluate the honesty of Bakura's senators, and felt that blackmailing them was in the best interests of the Bakuran public. She supported the idea of an alliance with the P'w'eck, and was very adamant that violence not be on Freedom's agenda, as she did not want Bakura's former regime to be replaced with one that she saw as equally bad. She and her friends thought of Freedom as Bakura's conscience, keeping things in balance.\n\nThanas's belief in the Balance dictated many of her actions. The Cosmic Balance claimed that any great force for good needed a counterbalancing evil force to exist, and that good works for some unintentionally led to evil results for others. As such, Thanas was reluctant to take a stance against others out of fear of backlash from the Balance, and she did not force violent citizens to disassociate themselves from Freedom. She did not encourage them to stay, however. Thanas accepted that the Balance had been behind her mother's death, but was nevertheless unhappy about having been on the receiving end of its actions. She was also initially hesitant to aid Jaina Solo out of fear of the Balance's backlash.\n\nThanas was very determined in her efforts to resist the New Republic, and impressed Solo with her ability to rise to a cause despite having lost both of her parents so early in her life. She resisted the attempts of Bakuran police to arrest her, and was only brought down by the combined efforts of four officers and two security droids. She was an able leader of Freedom, remaining calm and directing the actions of its members while their headquarters were being approached by Bakuran police. Solo saw a maturity in her face that was at odds with her young age, and found her gaze piercing. However, Solo also suspected that Thanas fought because she had nothing left to lose, and, although Thanas was proud of her resistance efforts, Solo observed that some of her fire had gone out. As she wearily sat in a prison cell, Thanas resigned herself to the idea that she would not receive a fair trial, and took some small comfort in the idea that any wrong done to her would ensure that some good came to somebody somewhere in the future. Despite her resignation, she was eager to escape from her cell when she found the coast clear.\n\nA romantic spark existed between Thanas and Vyram that was noticed by Solo on more than one occasion. The two kept their relationship strictly professional in public, however. Thanas was also close with several more of her friends, and was deeply hurt by the deaths of Zel and Jjorg. Although she believed that her allies one day could turn into her enemies the next, the betrayals of Salkeli and Blaine Harris similarly cut her deep. She fought to keep control of her emotions after she discovered their treachery, but broke down after Jjorg's death, openly crying and blaming Solo for not having prevented it. In the ensuing moments, her eyes betrayed her hatred of Salkeli and her fear of death threats issued by Harris.\n\nThanas was thin and very agile, able to leap across rooftops and swing hand-over-hand across power lines. She often proceeded through such dangerous situations without hesitation. Her black hair was complemented by different-colored eyes\u2014Thanas sported a green left iris and a gray right, although they were both brown in her infancy.\n\n",

        "content": "# R\u00e9illata - Biography[]\n\nR\u00e9illata was born around 51 BBY. When future handmaiden Eirta\u00e9 was just a girl, R\u00e9illata was elected Queen of the planet Naboo. Although she had not been a bad queen, after serving two years, R\u00e9illata decided to not run again. She had liked being queen and helping people, but by the end of her reign, she had convinced herself that she was not helping enough, instead turning her focus to opera. R\u00e9illata went on to be a moderately successful opera singer.\n\nYears later, in the middle of a performance, R\u00e9illata realized how ridiculous her logic was. She could sing arias in front of hundreds, was a good listener and orator, and felt she could connect with many people. R\u00e9illata spoke with her family on the idea of resuming her political career, and after Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala served two two-year terms, R\u00e9illata campaigned again to be elected Queen. She was elected again, beating Jamillia.\n\nDuring the ceremony in which political power was passed from Amidala to R\u00e9illata, R\u00e9illata revealed that Senator Oshadam was retiring from the Galactic Senate, having served after Naboo's senator, Sheev Palpatine, had been elected Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. She asked Amidala to serve in the Senate on behalf of Naboo and the other worlds in the Chommell sector, which Amidala eventually agreed to.\n\nLike her predecessor, R\u00e9illata was served by several handmaidens, including her young niece. When Amidala briefly returned to Naboo after a week-long stay on the planet Alderaan, R\u00e9illata welcomed her and her entourage back in the palace throne room. In a private conversation between the two, R\u00e9illata encouraged Amidala to return to the Senate and explained her decision to run for queen again.\n\n",

        "content": "# Malinza Thanas - Maze of deception[]\n\nThe two young women leapt across deserted rooftops until Solo sensed danger and shielded Thanas with her body. When several voices from a nearby tree addressed the Jedi, Thanas identified them as her comrades Vyram, Jjorg, Salkeli, and Zel, and assured them that Solo was a friend. The five members of Freedom led Solo to the Stack, a building that served as their headquarters, and began to posit theories on who had broken Thanas out of prison. While Vyram showed Solo the mysterious financial deal they had been tracking, he detected some electronic interference and discovered a homing beacon that had been stitched into Thanas's pants. The Stack's perimeter alarm was tripped as Bakuran security officials moved in on their location, and Solo fled with the beacon, bringing Salkeli along to navigate the city for her. Thanas and the others escaped in another direction, but were pursued by security officials who shot and killed Zel.\n\nThanas, Vyram, and Jjorg made their way to Harris's private chambers, hoping that the Deputy Prime Minister could help to clear them of criminal charges. Harris had plans of his own, however, and had employed the equally duplicitous Salkeli to capture Solo and bring her to his chambers. He hoped to prevent the Galactic Alliance from interfering with his plans to kill Thanas and turn her into a martyr that would unite the Bakuran people behind him. As Salkeli moved to secure stun cuffs around the wrists of all of Harris's guests, Thanas kneed him in the groin, which prompted Harris to shoot Jjorg dead. Thanas and Vyram were then fitted with binders, although Solo kept hers from locking by using a mind trick on Salkeli. Harris and Salkeli then led their prisoners to the stadium where the Keeramak's Consecration Ceremony was underway.\n\nHarris ushered his prisoners into one of the stadium's equipment lockers, sealed the door, and coerced Solo into pressing a remote detonator by holding Thanas at blasterpoint. The bomb's timed detonation would kill Cundertol, much of the senate, and Solo's parents; Harris intended to himself murder both Solo and Thanas. He planned to claim that Solo had attempted to derail the treaty between Bakura and the P'w'eck, and that Thanas had sacrificed herself to foil the Jedi Knight. As he prepared to use Solo's lightsaber to inflict realistic-looking wounds on Thanas, Solo loosed her binders, retrieved her lightsaber with the Force, and bludgeoned Harris unconscious with it. Thanas sprang into action as well and pinned Salkeli to the floor, twisting one of his arms behind his back. Solo freed Thanas and Vyram of their binders, but the trio discovered that a stray laser blast from Harris had melted the remote detonator. Solo seized Salkeli's comlink and instructed her ally Tahiri Veila to attempt to disarm the bomb, but the detonation occurred and knocked everyone in the locker to the floor.\n\nAfter the explosion, Goure Conor broke into the equipment locker. Thanas rushed out to expose Harris's plot to the public, only to discover that the consecration ceremony had been a ruse to allow the Ssi-ruuk, disguised as P'w'eck, to launch a full-scale invasion of Bakura. She rejoined Vyram in the locker, and the two brought their prisoners into an underground tunnel where the Solos and Conor were leading survivors of the invasion's initial attack away from the stadium. Cundertol was not far behind, having survived the bomb's detonation. He began to interrogate Harris about escape routes, and fired a blaster shot into his subordinate's head when the Deputy Prime Minister claimed that their only choice was to hide in equipment lockers. Cundertol then turned his blaster on Thanas, and began to whistle in the Ssi-ruuvi language. The Keeramak and a group of Ssi-ruuk warriors approached, and called on the ring of survivors to surrender and accept their forthcoming entechment\u2014the draining of their life-energy to power Ssi-ruuvi machinery. Cundertol had betrayed his own people after having been promised immortality by the invaders.\n\nThe Keeramak ordered his P'w'eck slaves to attack the prisoners, but was shot dead by the paddle beamer of the P'w'eck Lwothin, who led his brethren in an actual revolt against their masters. Jaina Solo and her lightsaber aided them in the ensuing firefight, and although the P'w'eck were victorious, Cundertol escaped. Concurrent P'w'eck mutinies aboard Ssi-ruuvi cruisers in Bakuran space brought a swift end to the invasion, and the P'w'eck Emancipation Movement formally allied with Bakura. The kidnapping charges leveled against Thanas were overturned, and the government hired her and Vyram to finish tracing the missing credits they had earlier discovered in a demonstration of Freedom's good intentions. The credits had in fact been laundered offworld by Cundertol in order to have a Human replica droid of himself built, and the Prime Minister had voluntarily undergone the Ssi-ruuvi entechment process in order to have his soul transferred into the droid's body. Jaina Solo was later able to track the missing credits to Onadax, where the droid had been built at the headquarters of Onadax Droid Technologies.\n\n",

When Thanas was three years old, her father contracted Knowt's Disease, and Captison neglected her re-election campaign in order to care for him. Her party was defeated in an election, and Pter Thanas passed away from his illness two days later. Captison then retired from politics to spend more time with her daughter. In 18 ABY, mother and daughter were visited by Captison's old friend Luke Skywalker, a Jedi Master of the New Republic. Skywalker approached Captison and requested the use of four of the Bakuran Defense Fleet's capital ships to break through an interdiction field in the Corellian sector, and was able to secure the warships from Bakura's government after two days of negotiations. Despite having retired, Captison was appointed to the ships as a representative of the Bakuran Senate, and invited Skywalker to her home on the morning of her departure so that he could meet Thanas. Thanas was sad to see her mother go, but asked Skywalker to promise to take care of her. The Jedi agreed, and Captison left her daughter in the care of two friends, Madame Boble and Lady Corwell, as well as Thanas's extended family.\n\nCaptison was drawn into the Corellian conflict, and was killed during its climactic battle between the New Republic and the power-hungry Sacorrian Triad. Thanas's family attempted to explain to her why her mother was not going to return to Bakura. Although the infant girl did not fully comprehend the situation, she did begin to resent the New Republic, an ire that lasted for at least another ten years. A woman named Laera, who came from a well-placed family, adopted young Thanas and raised her. Skywalker felt very responsible for and protective of Thanas and pledged to keep her safe, visiting her frequently on Bakura and helping sponsor her education. He once showed her a hologram of his niece and nephew, Jaina and Jacen Solo. After he wed a woman named Mara Jade, he began to bring his new wife with him on visits. Thanas became very fond of Skywalker and began to refer to him as \"Uncle Luke\"; she considered him and Laera to be the only family she had left. As she grew up, she developed a firm belief in the Cosmic Balance, a religion that claimed that all forces of good in the universe produced counterbalancing forces of evil. She also became a musical prodigy and earned a place in the Bakuran National Symphony. Her family's house was prepared to be given to her when she was deemed old enough to take it.\n\n",

Her father passed away from Knowt's Disease when she was three years old, and her mother was killed during the Corellian Crisis two years later. Thanas was adopted by a well-placed Bakuran family and was sponsored and frequently visited by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who had drawn her mother into the Corellian insurrection and felt responsible for the young Thanas. She became very fond of Skywalker, but harbored a deep hatred for the New Republic, the galactic government that he had acted on behalf of. As she grew up, she developed a strong belief in the Cosmic Balance religion, and at the age of fifteen, she formed a resistance movement known as Freedom and began peacefully protesting Bakura's role in the Galactic Alliance, the New Republic's successor state. Thanas lobbied for Bakuran independence but took a firm stand against Freedom's members use of violence to get their voices heard due to her fear of backlash from the Cosmic Balance. She was nevertheless arrested on charges of disturbing the peace and conspiracy, and was brought to a prison in Salis D'aar, Bakura's capital city.\n\nSeveral members of Skywalker's family came to Bakura at the time of Thanas's arrest, and when his niece Jaina Solo visited her in prison, Bakuran authorities engineered her escape in order to follow the two of them to Freedom's headquarters. As security officials closed in on them, Thanas and her closest friends fled and appealed to Bakura's Deputy Prime Minister Blaine Harris, who had been covertly funding their organization, for help. However, he planned to kill Thanas and to use her status as a martyr to unite Bakura behind him as he seized power within the government. Harris brought Thanas, Solo, and Vyram, another member of Freedom, to a stadium where Bakura's new allies, the P'w'eck Emancipation Movement, were performing a Consecration Ceremony to signal the beginning of the partnership. The ceremony was in fact a ruse organized to allow the expansionist Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, who had enslaved the P'w'eck, to attempt to invade Bakura, and Thanas and her friends fled from the invaders into tunnels beneath the stadium after they escaped from Harris's clutches. Several Ssi-ruuk warriors followed them, but were subdued by P'w'eck who began to actually revolt. The mutiny curtailed the invasion, and Thanas and Vyram were subsequently hired by the Bakuran government to trace a trail of credits that had been laundered offworld. The investigation was an effort to both expose senatorial corruption and to demonstrate the good intentions of Freedom to a skeptical public.\n\n",

        "content": "# Malinza Thanas - Peaceful protests[]\n\nBy the year 28 ABY, the New Republic had reorganized itself into a Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, Thanas organized an anti-New Republic resistance movement on Bakura called Freedom. Sixteen people strong, Freedom protested what they saw as Bakura's constant kowtowing to the New Republic; they believed that the planet needed to remain independent from the new Galactic Alliance and govern itself. Thanas refused to allow members of Freedom to use violent means to get their voices heard, and chose instead to capitalize on her late parents' reputations through the organization of public protests in Bakura's capital, Salis D'aar. The group was covertly funded by Bakura's Deputy Prime Minister Blaine Harris, who, although he believed in their cause, secretly wanted to seize power within the government.\n\nWhen the Bakuran Senate was approached by the P'w'eck Emancipation Movement and was offered an alliance against the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, Freedom supported the idea. With the P'w'eck as their slaves, the Ssi-ruuk of the Imperium had unsuccessfully attempted to invade Bakura twenty-four years prior. The P'w'eck had since organized an emancipation movement to attempt to win their liberty, and Freedom saw them as a viable alternative to the Galactic Alliance in helping defend Bakura from a potential Yuuzhan Vong attack. However, many Bakuran citizens who opposed the P'w'eck alliance joined Freedom and began to violently protest in the streets of Salis D'aar. Public opinion of Freedom plummeted, and Thanas and her closest friends opted to proceed more quietly toward their goals as they sliced into government files and uncovered evidence of senatorial corruption. Their hope was to blackmail Bakura's senate into governing honestly. Thanas and her friends began to trace a financial deal that sent millions of credits offworld through several intermediaries shortly after the P'w'ecks' arrival on Bakura, but an alarm was tripped during their investigation, and Thanas was arrested on charges of disturbing the peace and conspiracy. Many within the government also suspected that she was responsible for the kidnapping of Bakura's Prime Minister, Molierre Cundertol, who had disappeared shortly after he had personally invited the P'w'eck's Keeramak leader to Bakura to consecrate the planet.\n\nThe day that Thanas was taken into custody, several representatives of the Galactic Alliance arrived at Bakura after they received a tip from a member of the information-gathering Ryn Network that something bad was soon going to happen on the planet. Among them were Luke Skywalker's sister Leia Organa Solo, brother-in-law Han Solo, and niece Jaina Solo. When the group was tipped off by the Ryn Goure Conor that Thanas had information they would need to solve their mystery, Jaina ventured to the Salis D'aar Penitentiary and was permitted to visit the prisoner in Cell Twelve-Seventeen. Despite Solo's ties to the Galactic Alliance, Thanas found that she easily trusted Skywalker's niece and told her about Freedom's goals and recent history, although she left out any mention of Harris's involvement. Solo revealed that Cundertol had resurfaced, had claimed to have escaped from his kidnappers, and was skeptical that Thanas was in league with them. When the young Jedi Knight rose to leave, she and Thanas discovered that the prison was devoid of guards. Thanas suspected that one of her friends had sliced into the facility's systems to help her escape, and eagerly followed Solo into the slums of the city.\n\n",

        "content": "# Malinza Thanas - Behind the scenes[]\n\nMalinza Thanas was created by author Roger MacBride Allen for the novel Assault at Selonia, the second installment of 1995's Corellian Trilogy. She briefly appeared in the book, and was mentioned as being orphaned following the death of her mother in the trilogy's conclusion, Showdown at Centerpoint. Her fate was left unaddressed until James Luceno mentioned her in his 2000 novel The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse, stating that Luke Skywalker had sponsored her and often visited her on Bakura. Kathy Tyers reaffirmed that information in the novel The New Jedi Order: Balance Point, which was released and took place shortly after Jedi Eclipse. Tyers, who had herself created Thanas's parents and home planet, considered giving Thanas a minor role in the book, but felt that it would have distracted from the main plotline. She also did not want to place the character in danger, and felt creatively stifled by previous authors' non-use of the character, which left her with very little to draw from. Tyers thus resigned herself to addressing Thanas's fate by mentioning her status as Skywalker's sponsor child.\n\nJedi Eclipse and Balance Point were both entries in The New Jedi Order book series, and nearly three years later, another volume in the series gave Thanas a starring role. She was featured heavily in Sean Williams' and Shane Dix's The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee, which saw one of its three major storylines take place on Bakura. Refugee developed Thanas's character and personality as a teenager, fleshing her out considerably from what had previously been established. In a minor error, the book noted that her eye color was the same as her mother's, although the 1993 novel The Truce at Bakura stated that Gaeriel Captison's right iris was green and her left grey, the opposite of Thanas's.\n\nIn addition to her roles and mentions in novels, Thanas has been discussed in several sourcebooks, including 1997's Cracken's Threat Dossier and 2002's The New Essential Guide to Characters. She received her own entry in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.\n\n",

        "content": "# Malinza Thanas - Maze of deception[]\n\nThe two young women leapt across deserted rooftops until Solo sensed danger and shielded Thanas with her body. When several voices from a nearby tree addressed the Jedi, Thanas identified them as her comrades Vyram, Jjorg, Salkeli, and Zel, and assured them that Solo was a friend. The five members of Freedom led Solo to the Stack, a building that served as their headquarters, and began to posit theories on who had broken Thanas out of prison. While Vyram showed Solo the mysterious financial deal they had been tracking, he detected some electronic interference and discovered a homing beacon that had been stitched into Thanas's pants. The Stack's perimeter alarm was tripped as Bakuran security officials moved in on their location, and Solo fled with the beacon, bringing Salkeli along to navigate the city for her. Thanas and the others escaped in another direction, but were pursued by security officials who shot and killed Zel.\n\nThanas, Vyram, and Jjorg made their way to Harris's private chambers, hoping that the Deputy Prime Minister could help to clear them of criminal charges. Harris had plans of his own, however, and had employed the equally duplicitous Salkeli to capture Solo and bring her to his chambers. He hoped to prevent the Galactic Alliance from interfering with his plans to kill Thanas and turn her into a martyr that would unite the Bakuran people behind him. As Salkeli moved to secure stun cuffs around the wrists of all of Harris's guests, Thanas kneed him in the groin, which prompted Harris to shoot Jjorg dead. Thanas and Vyram were then fitted with binders, although Solo kept hers from locking by using a mind trick on Salkeli. Harris and Salkeli then led their prisoners to the stadium where the Keeramak's Consecration Ceremony was underway.\n\nHarris ushered his prisoners into one of the stadium's equipment lockers, sealed the door, and coerced Solo into pressing a remote detonator by holding Thanas at blasterpoint. The bomb's timed detonation would kill Cundertol, much of the senate, and Solo's parents; Harris intended to himself murder both Solo and Thanas. He planned to claim that Solo had attempted to derail the treaty between Bakura and the P'w'eck, and that Thanas had sacrificed herself to foil the Jedi Knight. As he prepared to use Solo's lightsaber to inflict realistic-looking wounds on Thanas, Solo loosed her binders, retrieved her lightsaber with the Force, and bludgeoned Harris unconscious with it. Thanas sprang into action as well and pinned Salkeli to the floor, twisting one of his arms behind his back. Solo freed Thanas and Vyram of their binders, but the trio discovered that a stray laser blast from Harris had melted the remote detonator. Solo seized Salkeli's comlink and instructed her ally Tahiri Veila to attempt to disarm the bomb, but the detonation occurred and knocked everyone in the locker to the floor.\n\nAfter the explosion, Goure Conor broke into the equipment locker. Thanas rushed out to expose Harris's plot to the public, only to discover that the consecration ceremony had been a ruse to allow the Ssi-ruuk, disguised as P'w'eck, to launch a full-scale invasion of Bakura. She rejoined Vyram in the locker, and the two brought their prisoners into an underground tunnel where the Solos and Conor were leading survivors of the invasion's initial attack away from the stadium. Cundertol was not far behind, having survived the bomb's detonation. He began to interrogate Harris about escape routes, and fired a blaster shot into his subordinate's head when the Deputy Prime Minister claimed that their only choice was to hide in equipment lockers. Cundertol then turned his blaster on Thanas, and began to whistle in the Ssi-ruuvi language. The Keeramak and a group of Ssi-ruuk warriors approached, and called on the ring of survivors to surrender and accept their forthcoming entechment\u2014the draining of their life-energy to power Ssi-ruuvi machinery. Cundertol had betrayed his own people after having been promised immortality by the invaders.",

Because evacuation was routine for Rebel bases, Alliance High Command began providing specialized training in evacuation procedures to chosen Alliance Special Forces officers following the Battle of Yavin. The Alliance then assigned these specially trained officers to high-priority bases. One of these SpecForce evacuation officers was Valdez, who earned a position at the Alliance's headquarters of Echo Base on the ice planet Hoth. During his time on Hoth, Valdez owned the astromech droid R5-M2, who was specially programmed to plan sublight tactical courses through space.\n\nWhen the Galactic Empire discovered Echo Base's existence in 3 ABY, the responsibility fell to Valdez to oversee the ice facility's rushed evacuation in the face of the imminent Imperial attack on Hoth. Present in Echo Base's central hangar, Valdez issued orders to his subordinates, explaining the base's evacuation plan: two snowspeeder groups, including Rogue Group, would stay behind to meet the Imperial invasion force while the base's fleet of thirty GR-75 medium transports would depart from the planet as soon as they were loaded, carrying vital personnel and supplies.\n\nValdez played a major role in helping Echo Base evacuate during the ensuing Battle of Hoth, with assistance from R5-M2, who provided tactical support to Valdez and planned evacuation routes from the base. As a testament to his efficiency and training, Valdez was able to ensure the safe evacuation of more than 86 percent of Echo Base personnel and surviving SpecForce soldiers.\n\n",

In 3 ABY, her agent, Morti, was able to get her a gig performing for the Imperial Governor of Kabray at Kabray Station during a diplomatic summit. However, after she arrived, she refused to perform, exclaiming that the entire thing was simply a freak show. Morti was dismayed over her decision, as he knew the governor would be very displeased.

        "content": "# Shawn Valdez - Behind the scenes[]\n\nShawn Valdez first appeared in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, portrayed by uncredited Star Wars visual effects art director Joe Johnston. Each of the Echo Base extras in the brief scene in which Valdez appears are, in fact, Star Wars matte artists, including conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie, Harrison Ellenshaw, and Michael Pangrazio. Johnston, who also has a cameo as a Death Star trooper in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, has gone on to direct such feature films as Jumanji, Jurassic Park III, and Captain America: The First Avenger.\n\nThe character was first provided a name on the \"Shawn Valdez\" card as part of the November 1996 Hoth Limited expansion set of Decipher's Star Wars Customizable Card Game, with the name synonymously used on a card for R5-M2 released in the same set. The character was named for Shawn Valdez, a Jacksonville, Florida, boy who died from leukemia at the age of thirteen after a near eight-year struggle. Valdez was an avid fan of the Star Wars franchise and the trading card game. Dreaming of having his own SWCCG tournament rating on the Decipher website, Valdez died a day after attending a SWCCG tournament from which he had to leave early due to weariness brought on by his condition. Due to the efforts of Gregg Keefer, who ran the tournament, and with Lucasfilm's permission, Decipher agreed to name a Star Wars character in Valdez's memory. The card's text, which describes the Shawn Valdez character as a \"leader\" and a \"poetic musician,\" is a direct tribute to Valdez for his courage and for poetry he contributed to a book titled I Will Sing Life, compiled by children with life-threatening illnesses.\n\nA discrepancy exists over the character's rank with the Rebel Alliance. The article Who's Who in Echo Base from Star Wars Insider 74 identifies Valdez as a major in the character's biographical section heading, but the biographical entry itself describes the character as a captain. Given that all other sources, including the original The Empire Strikes Back film script, identify Valdez as a captain, this article treats the captaincy rank as canonical.\n\n",

Afterwards, he became an activist for an extremist faction of the Bark Lovers' Alliance, a local environmental group. However, as he needed money, he also became a member of the band Piggie and the Orbiting Nasties.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Cartel organized a celebration on the moon Dorumaa. Nyronusa and some of his fellow members of the Buraka irstat believed that attacking the event would be the perfect way to gain revenge against the Cartel. They transported a number of mulissiki and kilassin from Cularin and released them near to where the event was being held, in hope that the creatures would attack and kill all of the people present at the event. However, the heroes of Cularin killed all the creatures and stopped Nyronusa.\n\n",

        "content": "# Xizor - Behind the scenes[]\n\nXizor was created as the main villain for the Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire multimedia project with the aim to be an equal of Palpatine and Darth Vader in evil and viciousness. Initially this vague archvilain was known as \"leader of the syndicate\"; in the first stages of the comic adaptation Ryder Windham even envisioned him as \"Jabba's boss\". His role and background, along with the Falleen species, were created during the brainstorm session at Skywalker Ranch in November 1994. Steve Perry came up with the idea of the Falleen pheromones, and the skin color change according to mood. In notes from 5 December 1994, Xizor was given a name and was described as the only one who could defeat Vader in a power struggle; he is compared to a \"corrupt Aristotle Onassis\" or the sneaky Virgil Sollozzo from The Godfather.\n\nArtists aimed for a reptilian, exotic and having a regal stature. Xizor was first depicted in sketches by Michael Butkus \u2014 reportedly while listening the Batman soundtrack. Kilian Plunkett contributed with four pages of Xizor experimentations in January 1995; aware of Star Wars drawing inspiration from \"samurai epics\", he attempted to give Xizor an oriental look, consulting illustrations of Mongol warriors, even experimenting with a Ushanka-hat or a cowl; he also elongated his face to make him more unhuman. Concept art included storyboards of the video game. Around February 1995 the team settled with a figure that was more monstrous than the final one, with a large skull, and topknotted ponytail that fell on his shoulders; until Jon Knoles noted that he was lacking the charm supposed to have. Around April 1995 Knoles provided a printout with Xizor's face smirking, capturing the character's appearance and personality; the image (which made it to the cover of the video game), garnered praise, and helped define and finalize the character. Butkus made the drawing with Xizor's iconic pose, itself inspired from a concept art of Bib Fortuna for Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. Susumu Sugita sculpted a twelve-inch statue of Xizor based on Butkus, which was used as a visual reference for illustrators and painters throughout the multimedia project.\n\nWhile Drew Struzan was working on the cover for the novel in April 1995, Lucy Autrey Wilson instructed him about Xizor to \"make his costume the color of gun-metal and his skin a faintly greenish/beige. His eyes are violet.\"\n\nFor the comic, Plunkett was instructed to make loose pencils for Xizor until his visuals were finalized. Knoles credits Plunkett for giving a sleeker quality to his face by adding \"a lot of nice lines\".\n\n\"Xizor's Theme\" was composed by Joel McNeely for the Shadows of the Empire soundtrack, and can be heard in the Shadows of the Empire video game and the audiobook. Xizor's voice in the video game was provided by Nick Tate.\n\nXizor makes many cameo appearances during the podrace scene in The Phantom Menace, as the micro-machine toy figurine of Xizor was used as a stand-in for members of the podrace crowd. However, as this cameo is used only as background fill-ins, it may not be considered an actual appearance of the character proper.\n\nIn the game Star Wars: Empire at War, Xizor had a finished 3D model, but was excluded from the final game. He would make an appearance in holographic form in the expansion pack, Forces of Corruption. The name of Xizor's model is: \"NI_PRINCEXIZOR.ALO\"\n\n",

        "content": "# Lowbacca - Yuuzhan Vong War[]\n\nWhen Chewbacca died at the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Lowbacca attended his funeral on Kashyyyk. Later, he and Chewbacca's son Lumpawaroo vowed to take up his life debt to Han Solo after Chewbacca's funeral, but Han insisted that he was still mourning Chewbacca. Instead, Luke assigned him to accompany Jedi Knight Daye Azur-Jamin and his wife Tinian I'att, a Wookiee-trained bounty hunter, as scouts in Hutt Space.\n\nWhen Daye was captured on Nal Hutta, and the Yuuzhan Vong tightened their grip on Hutt territory, however, Lowie and Tinian had to flee back into the New Republic territory, returning to his home planet of Kashyyyk.\n\nEarly in the War he returned to Yavin 4, and trained with Finn Galfridian. He then went with Finn and the Solo's to Nar Shaddaa to retrieve a holocron.\n\nUnable to fulfill the debt to Han himself, Lowbacca subsequently stuck close to the Solo children, particularly Jaina. He took part in the Myrkr strike team's assault on the voxyn cloning facility onboard the worldship Baanu Rass, and subsequently served as Jaina's first mate aboard Trickster. He later became a member of Twin Suns Squadron under Jaina's command, where he earned the nickname Streak. At the Battle of Ebaq, Lowbacca was stabbed by the Yuuzhan Vong Warmaster Tsavong Lah, but the wound was not fatal. By the end of the war, Lowbacca was commanding a squadron of his own, and he later bonded with a seedship on Zonama Sekot which he flew during the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar. After the war, Lowbacca told Han he and Waroo were assuming Chewbacca's life debt.\n\n",

This attempt almost failed due to the presence of the RePlanetHab organization, who claimed the rights for the world. Chief of State Cal Omas was able to block RePlanetHab's attempts at the \"suggestion\" of Leia Organa Solo. By the end of the Swarm War in 36 ABY, some scientists were residing on the planet, studying it in hopes of rehabilitation, but most Ithorians settled on Borao along with Felucia, \u00d6etrago and the worlds of the Upell system.\n\nHowever, considering the Ithorians' skills in ecology and their previous experience in re-terraforming worlds such as Telos IV, they hoped that Ithor could have been reinhabited one day. Abandoning the Ossus Project of Jedi Master Kol Skywalker, the Ithorians decided to rebuild their world using the same technology as during the Restoration of Telos IV. By 137 ABY much of the planet's surface remained rocky and dry, but genetically engineered dangerous plants and animals began to slowly transform the planet's soil and atmosphere into livable state. Visitors to the planet surface were still required to wear breath masks to avoid a large number of toxins in the atmosphere, but enviro-suits were no longer necessary.\n\n",

        "content": "# Lowbacca - Second Imperium Crisis[]\n\nIn 23 ABY at the age of 19, he went to study at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum. Since most of the people Lowbacca would have to interact with were not fluent in Shyriiwook, the Wookiee trade language, he used a small translator droid that he carried at his waist named Em Teedee. Later in 24 ABY it was modified to hover, and followed him around flying. He became friends with Jaina Solo, Jacen Solo and Tenel Ka. Jacen had a good sense of humour, and Lowie liked him because of this. Lowbacca's combination of computer skills and biological knowledge, and desire to take on the impossible would make him an invaluable asset to the Jedi.\n\nLowbacca unknowingly set a chain of events in motion when he discovered what eventually turned out to be a derelict TIE Fighter in the jungles of Yavin 4. His new friend Jaina Solo, somewhat envious of Lowbacca's T-23 skyhopper, wanted to repair the TIE Fighter. With the help of Lowbacca, Jacen Solo, and Tenel Ka, she did, but the friends didn't know that they were being watched by the TIE Fighter's pilot, Qorl. Eventually he was forced to reveal himself and he took the Solo twins hostage, forcing them to repair the fighter for him.\n\nLowbacca ran away to his skyhopper, and returned with it in an attempt to intimidate Qorl into running away. However, Qorl called his bluff and critically damaged the airspeeder, forcing Lowbacca to abandon it in the jungle. Lowbacca tore through the jungle on foot for the Praxeum, losing Em Teedee in the process. Once he got there, he couldn't communicate with anyone. He then remembered that his uncle and Han Solo were still in the system and within communicator range, delivering supplies to Lando Calrissian's GemDiver Station. Solo translated the situation to Tionne Solusar. A rescue mission was mounted and the twins were recovered.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lowbacca was kidnapped along with his friends Jacen and Jaina, as well as Em Teedee while on a field trip to GemDiver Station. The little droid was taken away from him and they were brought to the Shadow Academy. There, Nightsister Tamith Kai tried to exploit his anger in an attempt to turn him to the dark side. She went to such lengths as reprogramming Em Teedee to spout pro-Imperial propaganda or subjecting him to arduous torture.\n\nLowbacca gave into his anger twice, the first time when Brakiss attacked Jaina with Force lightning, and the other when he smashed a screeching sonic generator beyond all repair. However, Lowbacca was able to keep himself from being indoctrinated. When Jacen freed himself using a Corusca gem that he had acquired during their field trip, Lowbacca used his excellent programming skills to help his friends in an escape attempt aboard the station just in time for Luke and Tenel Ka to show up to rescue them.\n\nLater, Lowbacca went to Kashyyyk with Jacen, Jaina, and Tenel Ka in response to his sister, Sirrakuk's, coming of age and going deep in the underlevels of Kashyyyk to harvest strands of the deadly syren plant. Lowbacca had done this under unwise counsel alone, and Sirrakuk wished to repeat this, as did her best friend and Lowbacca's admirer, Raabakyysh. When Raaba did, though, she disappeared and was presumed dead.\n\nShortly after their arrival, the Second Imperium, headed by Zekk, came to raid a factory for computer supplies for the new fleet. The two parties soon met, and started a skirmish that killed the Nightsister Garowyn, tumbling into the underlevels of the Kashyyyk forest. There, Lowbacca and the others headed off Vonnda Ra and eleven stormtroopers. Shortly following, they encountered a syren plant. There, Nightsister Vonnda Ra and Sirrakuk were swallowed by the carnivorous plant, with Vonnda Ra being eaten and Sirrakuk pulling out the strands of the plant and then being pulled out by Lowbacca.\n\nIn the Third Battle of Yavin, Tenel Ka and Lowie sabotaged the floating battle platform from which Tamith Kai lead her forces, causing it to crash into a river killing the Nightsister. Suddenly, a bomb exploded and destroyed a large proportion of the Jedi Praxeum though no one was badly injured. With the end of the battle, the Second Imperium had been defeated.\n\n",

When Ujaa was fired following the complaints of the leader singer Elinda, Uksaris was in need of a suitable replacement, and Loopa became the one to take Ujaa's place. The third member, Ujii, as the brother of Ujaa, was displeased at Ujaa's dismissal and quit the band. To assist Uksaris in finding a replacement for Ujii as well, Loopa recommended the Bith Fodo, an offer Uksaris gladly accepted.\n\nElinda, Loopa, and Fodo would thus form the second incarnation of the Twisted Rancor Trio, much more successful than the first. The group began to gain fame and were most popular on its homeworld of Taris where Elinda's voice was especially admired.\n\nEventually around 3956 BBY, the band attracted the attention of Davik Kang, a powerful businessman that was actually head of the local crime syndicate, the Exchange. Though Kang's connections to the Exchange were not expressly known, rumors prevailed regarding it, and these rumors were enough to dissuade Elinda from accepting Kang's invitation for the band to perform at his estate. Uksaris, believing that this was the chance for the band to rise to stardom, thought that the opportunity was too great to pass up, and neither Loopa and Fodo were prepared to decline the invitation either. On the eve of the scheduled performance, Uksaris made a last minute recruitment of Elinda's sister Ashana to replace Elinda as the lead singer.\n\n",

In 439 BBY, scientists attempted to bond the telepathic capabilities of the bafforr tree with another, more vicious tree on the planet surface.

        "content": "# Star Wars Pinball - Initial release[]\n\nThis table, designed by Peter \"Deep\" Grafl, focuses on the eponymous film, with a main objective of playing through six scenes from the classic film, each broken up into smaller segments. Scene one features Luke Skywalker investigating the crash site of a Viper probe droid on Hoth before getting captured by a wampa. After escaping the wampa, the player must search for Luke as Han Solo before fighting off the probe droid. Scene two depicts the Battle of Hoth, completed by battling stormtroopers and then tripping AT-ATs. The third scene involves navigating the Millennium Falcon through an asteroid field while evading TIE fighters, Luke stacking stones with the Force on Dagobah, and fighting off mynocks. Scene four features the arrival to Cloud City, asking for landing permissions, and fighting off Darth Vader in the Rinetta dining room. In scene five, players help Chewbacca, Leia Organa, and Lando Calrissian escape Cloud City and help Luke defeat stormtroopers upon his arrival. The climactic Duel on Cloud City serves as scene six. The first portion is a first-person mini-game in which the player must block Vader's lightsaber strikes. The rest of the scene involves evading objects thrown by Vader and the ending of the battle. The table's grand finale is a multiball mode augmented by a series of bonuses from hitting Yoda's hut.\n\nOther modes in the table include a first-person lightsaber training minigame against a training remote, an AT-AT hunt, a battle against Darth Vader in which players needed to launch the ball up a ramp towards the Sith, Jedi and Sith multiballs, a Hyperspace multiball, an Imperial multiball, and a Cloud City multiball.\n\nThe kickback on the table is a magnetic shield earned by lighting the letters LANDO. There are bonuses for hitting rollover lanes to spell SKY, WAL, and KER, spelling C-3PO, spelling EMPIRE, and spelling R2-D2 before hitting the astromech bumpers.\n\nThe Boba Fett table was designed by Zolt\u00e1n V\u00e1ri, celebrating the enigmatic bounty hunter's exploits, with a main objective of completing bounties for the Empire or for Jabba. These missions introduce animations featuring Darth Vader, stormtroopers, and Jabba.\n\nThe bounties for the Empire included unmasking a Rebel spy, using flamethrowers to sabotage a Rebel facility, and retrieving an ancient Sith artifact for Darth Vader. The latter mission subsequently triggers a battle between Vader and Fett in which the player must get the ball into the table's sarlacc pit multiple times until Vader Force chokes Fett.\n\nMissions for Jabba include stealing Imperial data, retaking seized goods from an Imperial fleet, and acting as a bodyguard. The data-stealing mission involves a video mode in which the player must shoot a tranquilizer dart at a stormtrooper guard. In the seized goods mission, the player must steer Slave I and fire at TIE fighters. As personal bodyguard to Jabba, the player must guard Jabba from assassins by using a rocket launcher to redirect the ball.\n\nThe table also features a three-part wizard mode surrounding the hunt for Han Solo. The player must first pursue the Millennium Falcon, then escape the sarlacc pit by striking the sarlacc's tentacles with the ball and subsequently sinking balls into the pit. Defeating the sarlacc leads to a 5-ball victory multiball with increased jackpots.\n\nThere is also a side mode involving wild space and the Kamino uprising from the Star Wars Legends game Star Wars: Battlefront II. The Kamino uprising sequence is a minute-long 4-ball multiball in which the player has to defeat ten anti-troopers.\n\nOther features of the table involve a Mandalorian multiball from locking balls in Slave I, a sharpshooter minigame, a Whipcord launcher ball save, and a rivals hurry-up mode in which the player battles other bounty hunters.\n\nThe Clone Wars (Designed by Iv\u00e1n \"Mad_Boy\" Nicoara)\n\n",

        "content": "# Xizor - Vying for Vigo[]\n\nMere months after the Declaration of a New Order, Prince Xizor emerged as a leading competitor to become a Vigo within Black Sun, facing fierce competition from the Nediji assassin Kaird. The two competed for the favor of Underlord Dal Perhi, vying for his approval through successful missions for the syndicate while also sabotaging each other's efforts. Xizor's cooperation with Perhi was instrumental in reorganizing Black Sun and mending the faction in the wake of the bota fiasco, though it was still recovering from the death of Alexi Garyn after thirteen years. The competition reached its peak when Kaird devised a scheme to trap Xizor into buying a stolen hypergem from the Chagrian executive Gogh Pleetik on Metellos, a move that would have cost Xizor's favor with the Underlord by angering an important Black Sun ally. However, the Prince anticipated Kaird's scheme, and when purchased the hypergem, he took it to Perhi as a sign of his loyalty, and to expose Kaird's plot and turn the Nediji in.\n\nBelieving he had all but secured the position of Vigo, the Falleen was given one final mission by Underlord Perhi: to find and retrieve the droid 10-4TO. This droid was being hunted by both the Galactic Empire and a budding resistance movement known as the Whiplash. Perhi hoped to use the protocol droid as a bargaining chip to ensure the Imperial government did not interfere with his syndicate's nefarious operations. However, the true objective of the mission was not the droid itself. Instead, Perhi was setting Prince Xizor up to be assassinated by Kaird, who posed less of a threat to the Underlord's grip on Black Sun.\n\nThe assassination attempt failed, and with the help of 10-4TO, Xizor captured Kaird, and headed for the Factory District following a brief encounter with the Jedi Knight Jax Pavan and his band of companions who were hunting for the droid. There, Xizor revealed to Kaird that he planned to kill Underlord Perhi, and replace him with a human replica droid so that he could manipulate Perhi and eventually replace him at the helm of Black Sun. The Falleen planned to brainwash Kaird into murdering the Underlord, but was foiled when his scientists were slaughtered by feral droids.\n\nXizor was then found by Nick Rostu, who led the Falleen to the rest of Jax Pavan's group, which had followed Xizor half way around Coruscant in pursuit of 10-4TO. With the help of the droid, Xizor subdued the group and tied them up. He was about to kill Pavan with his own lightsaber, when Rostu and the sentient protocol droid I-5YQ simultaneously attacked Xizor. Rostu's attack was easily beaten back, but I-5 was able to subdue Xizor by training his finger lasers on the Prince. Pavan called the droid off, and began dueling Xizor. Pavan was able to disarm Xizor when he regained his sporadic control of the Force. Xizor was able to escape by stealing a blaster from the unconscious Nick Rostu, and proceeded to steal Kaird's ship and fled the Factory District.\n\nYears later, Prince Xizor was presented another opportunity to consolidate power, one which he wasted no time in securing. Fliry Vorru, the planetary governor of Corellia, was appointed Moff of the Corellian Oversector under the Empire's reign. His rule was rather relaxed particularly in relation to crime. With his extensive network of political and criminal connections, Vorru wielded considerable influence by 7 BBY, and was considered a possible alternative to Emperor Palpatine by some. Xizor moved on the Emperor's behalf, framing the Moff on numerous charges and having him exiled to Kessel. Black Sun also seized all profitable operations on Corellia.\n\n",

Lead by Captain Alima he threatened the Ithorians with the destruction of their sentient forests, the Cathor Hills. However the Empire was ousted from the planet through a deal formulated by Momaw Nadon, where he bargained with the Empire to reveal the secrets of the Ithorians' technology and agricultural ceremonies, in return for the protection of their 'mother jungle'.\n\nSometime after the Battle of Yavin, the Galactic Empire planned to attack the planet. The Rebel Alliance heard of these plans prior to the attack and dispatched Han Solo to rescue a group of Ithorians wishing to evacuate. Just a few minutes before the attack, Han and his co-pilot Chewbacca were able to rescue the Ithorians. A small battle raged afterwards, with many TIE Fighters.

He followed a strict no post-relationship contact policy, which on at least one noted occasion, he deemed he had to terminate the woman when she attempted to contact him again. When he was between relationships, Xizor was known to occasionally sleep with Guri as she was fully female even in that respect.\n\nXizor also became enamored of Leia Organa and attempted to seduce her. As with his other schemes, this backfired dramatically. He used his pheromones upon her and for a while, the woman submitted to the scent. However, after Chewbacca brought Leia back to her senses, she quickly rebuffed his advances by kneeing him in the groin, leaving an enraged Xizor to lock her up.\n\n",

Disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, the Rebel leader accompanied by \"Snoova\" (Chewbacca) was welcomed into the Underlord's Palace on Imperial Centre. Enticed by Organa's beauty, Xizor tried to seduce her using his pheromones to cloud her mind and make her susceptible to his flirting. However, his efforts were thwarted by Chewbacca's intervention, the latter who revealed Xizor's ploy to Leia. The Princess returned in the Underlord's presence to stall for time, but kneed him in the groin to rebuke his advances, leading the frustrated crime boss to imprison her. Soon after Luke's escape from the Barabel mercenaries, Skywalker, Dash Rendar, Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian infiltrated Xizor's abode in order to rescue Leia.\n\nXizor confronted the group during their escape, attempting to kill Skywalker himself. A standoff ensued when the Jedi trainee pulled a thermal detonator rigged to a dead man's switch; if Skywalker died, Xizor would die too. Calrissian threw another thermal detonator down a garbage chute, set on a five-minute delay, and the Rebels escaped to the palace's roof where the Millennium Falcon was waiting for them. The Dark Prince escaped in the Virago and fled to his orbiting skyhook, seething as his expensive palace collapsed to the ground under the thermal detonator's blast.\n\n",

When Aruk the Hutt, head of Besadii kajidic, was killed by his rivals from Desilijic, Xizor lent his assistance to Aruk's heir, Durga; he offered to kill off the latter's rivals within the clan, ensuring a smooth transition of power, in exchange for his cut of the profits in Besadii's spice operations on Ylesia. Later on, Xizor also provided Durga with security for Ylesia, by granting him the services of a private security company that normally worked in tandem with Black Sun; again, the Hutt gangster agreed, and in exchange offered the Dark Prince an even greater share of the Ylesian enterprise. When a Rebel strike team destroyed Ylesia anyway, Durga was left with little to no resources, and subsequently became one of Xizor's Vigos, one of the latter's many subordinates in the Black Sun syndicate.\n\nEven after the \"acquisition\" of Besadii, Xizor also had dealings with Jabba, head of Desilijic, with the Hutt crime lord addressing him in Basic, a very rare concession from him. In the end, the Dark Prince had succeeded in extending Black Sun's power far into the Outer Rim, while eliminating the threat of serious competition from the Hutt Cartel. From now on in the galactic underworld, his organization was a power without equal.\n\nXizor also worked with the Assembler Kud'ar Mub'at to bring about the destruction of the Bounty Hunters' Guild and to replace it with an supply of freelance bounty hunters loyal to the Empire. However, at first he only succeeded in splitting the Guild into two warring factions; posting a huge bounty for rogue special-forces stormtrooper Trhin Voss'on't, Xizor's goal was fully realized when the two warring factions tore themselves apart, though the commando had played his role in the plot, he was nonetheless dispensed with by the Dark Prince's agents.\n\nAt one point, the Xizor tried and failed to wrest control of Kuat Drive Yards from Kuat of Kuat, causing the latter to attempt a frame-up against the Black Sun leader for the murders of Owen and Beru Lars, Luke Skywalker's guardians.\n\n",

Dash Rendar's droid, LE-BO2D9 had gotten a message to Rogue Squadron who arrived to help the fleeing Rebels out, but the true turning point came from an unlikely source, the Empire.\n\nDuring a communication with his skyhook, Prince Xizor made the grave error of muttering Skywalker's name in his instructions to destroy a YT-1300 light freighter despite being warned by Lord Vader not to go after him. Instead of being able to claim he was after a group of renegades flying a YT-1300 freighter, he had made things personal. As Palpatine was away inspecting the second Death Star, Vader, as Supreme Commander, was left in charge of Coruscant. He was aboard his flagship, the Super Star Destroyer Executor when the fateful message was intercepted and ordered his TIE Fighters to attack Black Sun's StarVipers. Vader sent a holo-message to Falleen's Fist demanding that Xizor cease his attack immediately and surrender into his custody. As the seconds ticked away, Vader listened to communications from the skyhook and the chief of the Xizor fleet who was begging to be allowed to surrender until his ship was destroyed. There was no answer from Xizor and when time was up, Vader gave the order to destroy the skyhook.\n\nWith the destruction of the skyhook, Xizor was presumed dead and his niece Savan took control of Black Sun, which consequently underwent a civil war and spawned at least one offshoot, the Black Nebula. By 43 ABY, there were still rumours among the New Jedi Order that Prince Xizor was somehow alive; however, they were quickly debunked.\n\n",

A more subtle addition was the the Cantina Jukebox menu, which let players select different Star wars music to play within game menus.\n\nThe Switch release also took advantage of the console's ability to be handheld, allowing players to turn their screen vertically for another mode of gameplay.\n\n",

They used their combined Force ability and won the Blockade Runners' Derby. The fact that they were training at Luke's Jedi Praxeum caused controversy, but as the ship had not been modified specifically for the derby, as was commonly done by participants, after a few days the matter was dropped.\n\nLater in a docking bay some chameleon creatures, loyal to the Black Sun, were stealing the space mines they had found. Lowie, the Solos, Zekk, and Tenel Ka ran out of the Rock Dragon to stop them. A few of the chameleon creatures were killed. Anja Gallandro arrived and killed one more escaping chameleon, but they ultimately escaped with the mines.\n\nWhen Han Solo came, Anja accused him of killing her father. Han denied this, his children unconvinced either. Anja convinced them to go with her to Anobis, onboard the Millennium Falcon (She really intended to get Han killed in the war). They landed near Yuos's village where they were attacked by Knaars. After Jacen used a mind trick to scare away the Knaars, Tenel Ka, Jacen, and Lowie went into the woods to meet up with the Falcon. Upon arrival they were arrested by Elis.\n\nAnja then went back to Yons's village with Elis's brother, Protas to blow it up, but one of the mines Protas planted detonated and killed him. After hearing this Elis was more open to negotiations, the end result being Lowie and the Solos' freedom, and an end to Anobis's 25 year war.\n\nAnja came back with them to Yavin 4. She shunned everyone but Zekk and Jacen. A few weeks later, Lando invited them to come to Cloud City so they could see the amusement park SkyCenter Galleria that he and Cojahn were working on. Upon arrival they learned Cojahn was killed (unknown to them by the Black Sun).\n\nLando, despite the bad news, continued with the tour he promised them. Due to lack of spice Anja told Czethros that Cojahn's death was under investigation. In the swamp simulated environment they found out that the Modal Nodes mysteriously disappeared so Lando, Zekk, and Jaina went to Clak'dor VII and learned of Black Sun's influence on Cloud City.\n\nWhile Lowie was in the snow environment, he noticed an Ugnaught spying on them, which they followed down a tunnel that led into an open room, where seven Black Sun mercenaries with images of them showed themselves, and Lowie ran down another hallway. The Ugnaught launched them down a garbage chute, Lowie grabbed an antenna and Tenel Ka with the other hand, however, Jacen wasn't as lucky and fell through the clouds.\n\nThe Lady Luck arrived with a rescued Jacen. With the information Jacen heard (from his rescuer M'kim) and the information Lando got from the Modal Nodes they then had evidence to link Cojahn's death to the Black Sun. Lowie looked up the holo recordings, and found a lot of the recordings deleted, but also found Czethros was on Cloud City and that he himself killed Cojahn.\n\nWhen Lowie, Jacen, and Tenel Ka went to the address for the debriefing about the Black Sun, they were attacked by the Bespin Wing Guard and Black Sun mercenaries. Lowie jumped into a cloud car and took off. One mercenary and one wing guard took off in pursuit of Lowie. Just as Lowie's engine was giving out, seven thrantas and their Riders came and knocked Lowie's pursuers out of their vehicle and caught them. Lowie then came for a landing on Cloud City.\n\nLowie later reunited with his fellow Jedi Knights (all had a similar run-in) and returned to Yavin 4. Later Anja ran out of spice so she stole the Lightning Rod, and flew it to the spice mines of Kessel. They got a lead from Lilmit so Tenel Ka, Jacen, and Zekk flew to Dac. Lowie and Jaina stayed on Kessel.",

        "content": "# Lowbacca - Dark Nest Crisis[]\n\nIn the years after the war, the Jedi went to great lengths to help the Galactic Alliance recover. Lowbacca worked with Jaina and Tesar Sebatyne on at least one occasion in helping to foil criminal warlords eager to profit from the war's fallout. In 35 ABY, after the three boarded the starship Night Lady and took down the Yaka pirate Redstar, they attended his trial on the maximum security space station MaxSec Eight. While Jaina was testifying, the received a Force-cry from their old friend Raynar Thul. Along with most of the other survivors of the Myrkr mission, Lowbacca followed it into the Unknown Regions and discovered that Thul was now Unuthul, the leader of a colony of Killiks.\n\nLowbacca was one of several Jedi who became Joiners and were absorbed into the Killik hive mind. He fought for the insectoid species during their conflict with the Chiss, and was captured by Chiss forces. He was released by Jagged Fel after the signing of the Qoribu Truce, but the move ended up forcing Fel's entire family into exile from the Chiss Ascendancy. After the truce, Lowie and Tesar hunted pirates who were hijacking abaarian water shipments.\n\nIn 36 ABY, the Killik-Chiss conflict was reignited by the machinations of Jacen Solo and erupted into an all-out Swarm War. During the war, Lowbacca, Tesar, and Tahiri Veila had endangered the security of the Jedi Order by telling Aryn Dro Thul, Raynar Thul's mother, that the Jedi were planning to kill her son. Grand Master Luke Skywalker found out and ordered the three to meditate on Dagobah for the remainder of the war.\n\n",

Lowie jumped into a cloud car and took off. One mercenary and one wing guard took off in pursuit of Lowie. Just as Lowie's engine was giving out, seven thrantas and their Riders came and knocked Lowie's pursuers out of their vehicle and caught them. Lowie then came for a landing on Cloud City.\n\nLowie later reunited with his fellow Jedi Knights (all had a similar run-in) and returned to Yavin 4. Later Anja ran out of spice so she stole the Lightning Rod, and flew it to the spice mines of Kessel. They got a lead from Lilmit so Tenel Ka, Jacen, and Zekk flew to Dac. Lowie and Jaina stayed on Kessel.\n\nWhile on Kessel, an army of Black Sun mercenaries took control of the planet and captured Nien Nunb, though Jaina and Lowbacca managed to escape. They found out that while Kessel, Czethros planed to send a signal that would trigger Black Sun spies everywhere. However, Jaina, Lowie, and M-TD sabotaged his plan by destroying the transmitter before Czethros could send the signal. Lowie also helped free the prisoners and defeated the Black Sun mercenaries. Czethros fell into a vat of carbonite and was flash-frozen instantly. The criminal was retrieved by the New Republic. As a result, the names of Black Sun spies in strategic positions of power were discovered amounting to the defeat of the Black Sun.\n\nFollowing this ordeal, the Solo Twins, Anakin, Tenel Ka, Lowbacca, and Zekk were promoted to apprentice Jedi Knights during a ceremony at the Jedi Praxeum.\n\n",

        "content": "# Xizor - Personality and traits[]\n\nPrince Xizor, according to Moff Fliry Vorru, relied too much on his ability to read others. Whereas it was true that he was an excellent judge of character, he did believe himself to be inherently superior to everyone. The Falleen ability to produce intoxicating pheromones together with his formidable brain and resourcefulness backed up his claim somewhat. He did underestimate the power of the Force which was why Sith and Jedi were able to get the better of him. He knew the Force existed and respected it but never truly understood it. Lord Vader once Force Gripped Prince Xizor during a three-way conversation with Emperor Palpatine, but the sovereign told his apprentice to put him down, knowing the strength of Black Sun would prove to be a valuable asset to the Empire.\n\nHe also considered himself a cultured man. Xizor did appreciate High Coruscanti living, dining at exclusive restaurants, eating Moonglow three or four times a month (at the most exclusive restaurant on Coruscant, the Manarai, where he was a part-owner), sponsoring museums and galleries. He once forgave a rival after the rival presented him an extremely rare miniature Firethorn tree. Such a gift, the Dark Prince mused, was enough to show him that the man was civilized and therefore his mistake could be forgiven.\n\nThe Falleen also prided himself on his emotional control, which he attributed to his cold-blooded, reptilian ancestry. He felt that mammalian races such as Humans were too easily ruled by their emotions, and that in particular they were susceptible to uncontrolled rage. His own \"cold\" anger was more controllable, and thus, he felt, superior. While a Human might seek immediate vengeance, Xizor was content to plan his revenge carefully, so as to ensure success, even if it required waiting for years to implement the plan. However, while the Dark Prince's anger built up slowly, in the end it was the very uncontrolled rage he believed himself immune to that doomed him. He was able to find entertainment in even the most hum-drum tasks and felt that boredom was for those who lacked imagination.\n\nXizor kept himself in top physical condition. He disliked tedious exercise and so preferred to use myostim units that exercised individual muscles. Xizor was dangerous even when confronted alone. His excellent marksmanship and martial arts training made him a deadly opponent whether he was armed or not.\n\n",

Bwua'tu had Jaina and Zekk monitoring secret Corellian shipyards in the Kiris Asteroid Cluster, but when the two were relieved of their posts and sent to the Hapes Cluster, Lowbacca and Tesar took over.\n\nThe Jedi departed the Alliance after it fell under the despotic rule of Jacen Solo, now the Sith Lord Darth Caedus. Lowbacca was one of many Jedi who fought against Caedus during the Battle of Kashyyyk, and led a Jedi charge against Caedus's flagship, the Anakin Solo. Caedus attempted to Force meld with Lowbacca in order to sense where the other Jedi Knights were. Lowbacca tried to mentally reason with Caedus while simultaneously launching a shadow bomb at the bridge of the Star Destroyer; the bomb hit, but a distraction caused by Ben Skywalker saved Caedus' life.\n\nLowbacca's home planet joined a Jedi Coalition directed against Caedus in the battle's aftermath.

The Yuuzhan Vong War blazed a trail from the Outer Rim, and Ithor lay directly in their path. Retreating from Dantooine and Dubrillion, the New Republic made a stand at the planet, hoping to resist the invasion long enough to make use of the bafforr tree pollen, which had somehow reacted violently with the living armor of the Yuuzhan Vong. The battle entered into a state of stalemate, until Jedi Knight Corran Horn dueled Shedao Shai, the leader of the Yuuzhan Vong forces, with the planet Ithor at stake. Though Horn was victorious, Shai's subordinate, Deign Lian, was ordered by Warmaster Tsavong Lah to unleash a plague of toxins upon the planet, in order to eliminate any chance of a pollen-based bioweapon. The virulent biochemicals (a biological gray goo) rapidly turned Ithor's verdant forests and animal life into a black ooze which spread and destroyed everything it touched.\nIn retaliation, the assembled Remnant and New Republic forces fired massive barrages of concussion missiles and proton torpedoes at the Yuuzhan Vong command ship, Legacy of Torment, which broke into three sections.

The Falleen were a species of reptilian humanoids, renowned for their physical beauty and cool self-control\u2014as well as for the powerful pheromones they exude at will. As the firstborn son of King Haxim, the ruler of a wealthy province on Falleen, Xizor was willful even by the cold standards of his people. He was educated off-world, and spent most of his life away from his homeworld. He constructed from scratch a vast shipping concern, Xizor Transport Systems, which would remain his principal legitimate front in the corporate business realm.\n\nAs head of Xizor Transport Systems, Xizor led the manufacturing of a number of starships created for large-scale transport and trading operations which were most famously used during the Galactic Civil War. It was this shipping organization that built on top of his vast personal wealth, most of which had originated from House Sizhran. Already a trillionaire during the last years of the Galactic Republic, Prince Xizor's extravagant tastes were evident from an early age. Despite his opulent lifestyle, Xizor remained a shrewd businessman, expanding his influence through ruthless maneuver. He made his presence known on Coruscant by erecting an enormous palace in the heart of the cityscape, east of the Presidential Palace. The massive undertaking required the former Farfalla skyscraper be razed to its sub foundations.\n\nDuring the advancement of his main enterprise, Prince Xizor very deliberately encountered the Black Sun criminal syndicate. The Falleen had already climbed up the ranks of the organization by the time of the Clone Wars, leveraging his cunning and powerful connections to navigate the turbulent landscape criminal underworld of the galaxy. During the war, the syndicate neared the brink of collapse due to a bota regulation deal with the Hutts falling apart. He patiently waited out the galactic conflict, biding his time for the opportune moment to assert his power. When the war concluded in 19 BBY, Prince Xizor quickly began to develop a close relationship with the newly proclaimed Galactic Emperor, Palpatine.\n\n",

He was a ruthless competitor and charismatic public figure in high society with his headquarters in the city planet Coruscant. Close to the Imperial Palace, but less splendid, was Xizor's Palace, his home outside Falleen and a testimony of his status.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth, Prince Xizor was considered one of the most influential beings in the galaxy due to his exceptional wealth and influence through his criminal activities. Xizor maintained an amenable business relationship with the Galactic Empire, as well as other notable syndicates such as the Hutt Cartel led by the notorious Jabba the Hutt. During this time Xizor also developed a bitter rivalry with Darth Vader within the shadows of the Empire, seeking to win Emperor Palpatine favor over his apprentice by murdering Luke Skywalker. His fixation on undermining Vader would be his undoing however, as an infiltration of Xizor's palace on Imperial Center by Princess Leia Organa and subsequent battle by his private skyhook in orbit led to the Dark Prince's demise at the command of Vader.\n\n",

        "content": "# Xizor - Family tragedy[]\n\nOnce Corellia fell into place with Xizor's plan, it was a matter of years before the Prince became the undisputed ruler of Black Sun. However, the success of a plan that had taken decades to unfold was overshadowed by a terrible incident that struck on Falleen. In the capital city of King Haxim's kingdom on Falleen, the Imperial Forces' Supreme Commander Darth Vader established an advanced biological weapons research laboratory as part of his exploration tour of similar weaponry development projects across the Outer Rim Territories. In 7 BBY, an accident released a deadly, flesh-eating contaminant near Xizor's home, prompting the Sith Lord to order the research lab, and the surrounding city, to be flattened. Haxim, his wife, four children and three brothers were wiped out in the orbital bombardment. Xizor was off-planet at the time, cementing his position as a Vigo in Black Sun. Upon his return, he had virtually all knowledge of his position destroyed; he planned to exact his revenge on Vader, but hid knowledge of his personal vendetta from the public.\n\nIn the years that followed, Xizor built two concurrent empires: one legitimate, one criminal. Thus, the Dark Prince emerged as the leader of Black Sun and the proprietor of several major galactic corporations. To fund and facilitate his illegal empire, Xizor had his legal firms, such as Xizor Transport Systems, funnel funds, transfer contraband and launder millions of credits. Xizor was driven by his desire to restore his opulent lifestyle and to destroy Darth Vader. To disguise his planned revenge, the Dark Prince used his connections to remove all record of the Sith Lord's involvement in the death of his family. Everyone assumed their rivalry was jockeying for favor from the Emperor, who subtly encouraged the rivalry.\n\nXizor ordered himself a personal craft, the Virago, which was a custom heavily modified StarViper Assault Fighter, made just for him. Upon completion, the Dark Prince purchased all rights to the fighter, ensuring it was unique. As his position necessitated a certain degree of paranoia and much distrust for the life forms around him, Xizor sought out a wholly obedient lieutenant and so he commissioned Simonelle and Massad Thrumble to construct him a Human replica droid modified according to his exact specifications, the end result of the project being Guri, whom Xizor bought for nine million credits. Once the two developers went their separate ways, the Dark Prince decided to ensure his new bodyguard's uniqueness by preventing her creators from producing yet another - while Thrumble's safety was guaranteed due to his association with the Empire, Simonelle enjoyed no such protection and Xizor had Guri track him down and kill him. Unknown to either the Dark Prince or his lieutenant, the dead man was nothing more than a replica, with the real scientist having fled into hiding.\n\n",

        "content": "# Xizor - Shadows of the Empire[]\n\nShortly after the Subjugation of Bespin, Xizor contacted Tyber Zann, head of the rival criminal venture known as the Zann Consortium, and made a deal with him. The latter crime lord agreed to steal tibanna from Cloud City and share 50% of the profit with the Dark Prince who would in turn arrange a meeting with the Emperor or one of his representatives. Xizor was aware of Vader's presence on Bespin and had staged the mission as a trap for Zann. Tyber completed the contract, but correctly suspecting a double cross decided to plant evidence pointing Vader into Xizor's direction during the raid and hired IG-88 to get access to planets on the gangster's hit list; after the theft, he sold the Tibanna Gas on the Black Market and used some to build his fleet.\n\nDuring this time, the Falleen kingpin's interests would also collude with those of the Empire, assisting in the construction of the second Death Star. Prince Xizor offered Lord Vader 300 ships for the construction project, and though the latter distrusted the seemingly amenable collaborator, he could not refuse without suffering Emperor Palpatine's wrath. Vader had good reason to distrust Xizor, however. The Falleen planned to destroy the cyborg, the man who had condemned his entire family to death, by executing a masterstroke of vengeance. Learning of his adversary's quest for Luke Skywalker, Xizor attempted to frustrate it and simultaneously lower Vader in Palpatine's esteem by having the young Jedi killed. Therefore he had Guri contact several guns-for-hire through intermediaries, and posted a bounty on Luke Skywalker's life. The Dark Prince also managed to convince the Emperor allow the Rebel Alliance to get a hold of the plans for the second Death Star. He could profit from this in one of two ways: he could deliver the insurgents to the Dark Lord of the Sith, therefore entering his good graces if the Empire won\u2014or if the Alliance did win the war, he would make sure they didn't forget the Black Sun's invaluable contribution to their victory.\n\nUpon learning that a smuggler named Dash Rendar was moving supplies for the Rebel Alliance while providing transport for a swoop racer Kimmi Chyler, Prince Xizor ordered his agents to investigate the activities, so that he could reveal them to Emperor Palpatine. He even dispatched Guri to confront Rendar directly in Kor Vella, though the smuggler managed to escape the Human replica droid.\n\nFor the final swoop race of the season at the Mos Espa Race on Tatooine Xizor Transport Company had provided several large luxury sand barges from which spectators could watch the race. The Dark Prince himself had come to witness the event from his personal barge, with his human replica droid henchman at his side. By doing so, Xizor hoped to lure Luke Skywalker onto his barge, where Skahtul could lay a trap for him. However, the Barabel mercenary failed to subdue the young Jedi and so his quarry escaped.\n\nXizor Transport Systems was also looking to sponsor a swoop racing team and following the race Xizor held a party, to which Kimmi Chyler was invited. Guri was also in attendance with her master but refrained from confronting Rendar at the party. During the party she chatted with the Falleen and became influenced by his pheromones, which caused her to develop a short-lived attraction to him. After the party, Xizor and Guri followed Chyler, Rendar and their bodyguard to a nearby cantina where the smuggler was delivering a datapad with Important information to Luke Skywalker. Xizor ordered Guri to kill the group and to take the datapad, but Skywalker and the others put up a strong defense. Finally, the Dark Prince gave up and ordered his enforcer to leave, promising to expose all information about the smuggler - and more importantly the Jedi trainee - to the Emperor.\n\n",

        "content": "# Max Rebo - Behind the scenes[]\n\nMax Rebo was created for Richard Marquand's 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, and first appeared in the film's novelization, released earlier in the same year. In the movie, he was portrayed by Simon Williamson, who also puppeteered Nien Nunb and a Mon Calamari, in addition to playing several Gamorrean guards. In his role as Rebo, Williamson wore a costume from the waist up that was constructed by Industrial Light & Magic. The costume was very tight-fitting, and has prompted Williamson to count himself lucky for not being claustrophobic. Unable to see, he was issued instructions via an earphone while wearing the costume. Two additional puppeteers helped to control the character's head and limbs.\n\nWhile the visual evidence from the finished film is inconclusive, production sketches and the construction of the costume itself indicate that the limbs Max uses to play the keyboard are feet rather than hands. Max was intended to be perched on a cushion at the same height as the organ's keys, and using his sole two limbs to play the keys. Due to the way the suit was operated, with Williamson's arms performing inside the legs, the positioning of the costumes' hips contorted to Williamson's shoulders, distorting the costumes' design and the intended effect. Because of this, the 1983 Kenner toy took the interpretation that Max was sitting or standing inside an enclosure of his organ with the lower part of his body obscured by the instrument, and depicted him with a roughly humanoid body construction, with two arms and two legs. Subsequently, the 1989 West End Games sourcebook Galaxy Guide 4: Alien Races continued this depiction, influencing future appearances of the Ortolan species in the Expanded Universe. Despite this error being rectified in canon, several Expanded Universe interpretations of Ortolan physiology have still made their way into various pieces of media.\n\nSince Return of the Jedi's release, Rebo has appeared in various works of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. He and fellow band members Sy Snootles and Droopy McCool were featured in the short story And the Band Played On: The Band's Tale, included in 1996's anthology Tales from Jabba's Palace, which told of how their band came to be in Jabba's service and established them as rivals of Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, the band seen in the Mos Eisley Cantina in the original Star Wars film. Who's Who in the Max Rebo Band, an article published in the sixty-seventh issue of Star Wars Insider in 2003, was the first source to mention Rebo's real name of Siiruulian Phantele. The director's commentary on the DVD release of Star Wars: Clone Wars revealed that Rebo is present among a group of Ortolans seen in the twenty-second episode of the series.\n\nAs Rebo resembles a Cerulean elephant, it is noteworthy that \"Phantele\" becomes \"Elephant\" when the syllables are swapped, and that \"Siiruulian\" resembles the word \"Cerulean\". However, no official source has confirmed that Who's Who author Rich Handley intended this parallel. The first Star Wars special of the American cartoon Robot Chicken poked fun at Rebo's resemblance to an elephant, presenting every song title of the Max Rebo band as asserting that Rebo is not an elephant.\n\nA blue-skinned elephant creature named \"Hooter\" appears and plays a keyboard in Michael Jackson's short film Captain EO. Many fans have speculated that Rebo inspired the creature's design, and although the speculation is not confirmed, it is noteworthy that Star Wars creator George Lucas served as the executive producer of the film.\n\n",

Therefore, it is impossible to verify the canonical species of Dunker. However, the quest dialogue given by Muse indicated that Vincol Dunker was a male. Although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining Dunker consistently identified him as an assassin.\n\n",

The player takes control of Darth Vader. Besides the arcade games, the player can also use the opportunity to get detailed descriptions of the TIE/LN starfighter, the TIE Advanced x1, and the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle. However, Vader cannot jump, and since it effectively acts as the main menu for the Arcade systems, Vader cannot select any vehicles.\n\nWhen the player accesses the docking bay, the Imperial March will be playing in the background. However, when the player gets into close proximity to the arcade machines, the music will change to a disco-style remix of the Star Wars main theme. The song was originally composed by the American musician Meco, who composed the song after seeing A New Hope (then simply titled Star Wars) in theaters. In addition, the setting will change to having multi-color patterns given off from a disco ball that was based in design on the Death Star, a reference to the joke opening for the game which depicts several Star Wars characters doing the disco dance.\n\nThe docking bay apparently incorporates elements from both Docking Bay 327/Home One as well as the Executor: The walls and ceiling were taken directly from the Executor's docking bay, and the space background was taken from either Docking Bay 327 or the Home One.\n\n",

She sometimes enjoyed singing songs in her mirror when unobserved and was a talented singer. She performed the role of Penelope Doodle in a class play of the hit drama My Fair L8-E.

The docking bay contained three TIE/LN starfighters, a TIE Advanced x1 starfighter, and a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle on the floor, and a TIE/sa bomber on the ceiling. It having a view of space indicates that it was placed on one of the Imperial Navy's vessels/stations, and the view being unobstructed indicates that it was on the side of the former. Little else is known about the docking bay other than the Sith Lord Darth Vader frequently accessing this area, it possessing three machines in the center of the docking bay that apparently are flight simulations for Yavin Prime, the Hoth system, and Endor, the former two utilizing a line-grid system similar to the IN-344-B \"Sightline\" holographic imaging system, and the third being more advanced, and sometimes activates a Death Star-like glass-patterned ball that reflects multi-colored lights when Vader approaches the simulators and activates odd beating rhythms of music that an Astromech Droid apparently had involvement in creating.\n\n",

Though Roan arrived early for the start of the term, he did not set up a profile right away because he couldn't figure out how and eventually decided he didn't really need to as he could simply use holomail to keep in touch with people. He changed his mind, however, when Gaiana got upset over not being able to select him as a \"top friend\" on her profile.\n\nRoan soon created his profile and enjoyed sharing jokes with his friends there, as well as updating his status, but was often left mean and bullying comments by Cronah and Cyrus. The two Zabrak Jedi Padawan regularly made fun of Roan and saw Holobook as an easy way to extend the scope of their bullying. Later in the term, when Roan briefly became friends of a sort with the two, he joined them in posting such comments on Holobook profiles. Yoda, upset by the Padawans' behavior and warning that such behaviors were a path to the dark side, temporarily shut down all student access to Holobook. Following a Lightsaber Fencing Tournament, Yoda turned access back on to celebrate, but Cronah and Cyrus were denied access for the time being due to their past bullying behavior and having been caught stuffing the class pet, Voorpee, in a locker.\n\n",

        "content": "# Cornelius Evazan - Project Starscream and the search for immortality[]\n\nEvazan went into hiding on Tatooine, where he set up the Cutting Edge Clinic in Mos Eisley. Under the name Doctor Cornelius, Evazan began operating on unsuspecting patients. He continued to specialize in cyborging and would occasionally use droid parts purchased from Jawas. He was eventually forced to flee Tatooine and, soon after, he was confronted by his old partner, Ponda Baba. The two reconciled and set up base in a castle on Ando, where Evazan made a new breakthrough. He came to the conclusion that it was the mind and not the body that was the key to immortality. He created a mind-transference machine, planning to transfer Ponda Baba's mind into a new body. He lured and trapped the Aqualish senator chosen to provide the body.\n\nEvazan hoped to transfer his own mind into the body of a \"perfect\" young man he had captured earlier. Unfortunately for Evazan, the young man was actually a bounty hunter named Gurion Silizzar using a holoshroud to disguise himself. Gurion sought revenge because seven members of his family had been victims of Evazan's operations. Gurion forcibly escorted Evazan up to the castle's roof, where Gurion planned to kill the doctor. Evazan's pet meduza, Rover, saved Evazan's life by attacking Gurion, who then fell off the roof to his death. It was then that the Aqualish senator in Ponda Baba's body went up onto the roof and detonated a thermal detonator. Evazan fell off the roof moments before the explosion. Once again, Rover saved Evazan's life by sacrificing his own to cushion his master's fall.\n\nAt an unknown time during the Galactic Civil War, Dr. Evazan conducted experiments on peko-pekos from the planet Naboo, hoping to create invincible creatures that would act as his protectors and mounts. This experiment resulted in the creation of the toxic peko-peko.\n\nSoon after the Battle of Yavin, Evazan went to work for Borborygmus Gog, hoping to gain information from Project Starscream on bringing life to the dead. Evazan moved to Necropolis to work on bringing corpses to life as part of the project. However, during this time, Boba Fett was pursuing Evazan. The bounty hunter caught up to Evazan on the planet Necropolis and executed the mad doctor while he was holding Zak Arranda hostage.\n\nPylum required that Fett leave Evazan's body behind, in hopes of holding off the Curse of Sycorax, and Fett agreed, but held them all responsible if he never collected the full bounty. Unknown to them all, Evazan had injected himself with a megadose of his own reanimation serum, and he eventually returned to life. However, the serum only worked well on recently dead bodies. The longer the body stayed dead before being injected, the less likely it was to survive reanimation. Evazan nearly completed his work, but was stopped by the zombie Kairn. Evazan tried to eliminate Hoole, Zak, and Tash Arranda, but Kairn refused to see his friends killed. He used the anti-serum created by DV-9 to kill the zombie army Evazan had created, then he and Evazan were seemingly killed when the potion touched them.\n\nHowever, Evazan seemingly cheated death yet again. As late as 9 ABY, the doctor was reportedly still at large. Baba also survived, in the body of the senator, and again sought revenge against Evazan.\n\n",

        "content": "# Cornelius Evazan - Behind the scenes[]\n\nAlfie Curtis played Dr. Evazan in A New Hope.\n\nEvazan first appeared in the novelization of A New Hope, ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster and published in 1976, half a year before the film. Evazan was unnamed and described as a short Human. In his scene, he was accompanied by a many-eyed and a rodent-like alien\u2014early incarnations of Ponda Baba and Kabe\u2014when they insulted Luke Skywalker. In this version, Obi-Wan Kenobi sliced Evazan's hand and cut Kabe and Baba in half. In the Revised Fourth Draft of the screenplay\u2014calling Evazan and Baba \"Human\" and \"Creature\"\u2014the scene was about the same. In the final film, Kabe didn't accompany Evazan, and Obi-Wan Kenobi dealt less drastically with the outlaws.\n\nIn Robot Chicken: Star Wars, Evazan is portrayed as a compulsive joker who doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut\u2014which leads to the loss of Ponda Baba's arm when he jokes that he and Ponda are wanted men.\n\nDuring the 2012 Super Bowl, Evazan appeared shortly after the Volkswagen commercial of a dog exercising and chasing a car, mocking \"The Force\" ad from the previous year (where a child dressed up as Darth Vader attempts to use the Force to start a Passat, only to be stunned when his father engages the remote ignition). He ends up nearly strangled by Darth Vader, who was present among the patrons and apparently overheard Evazan, prompting Evazan to apologize.\n\n",

The piece is also played in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic and its 2014 Shadow of Revan expansion.\n\nIn The Old Republic, a mission requires the Galactic Republic\u2013affiliated player to change the music in the Sith Empire\u2013controlled Sunken Sarlacc cantina to something more patriotic.

Unbeknownst to the conductor and the other passengers, the ship was besieged by Fastlatch-class defense droids, and Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi had been dispatched on a mission to thwart the attack. It was when the two Jedi had crashed through a skylight and onto a banquet table that the conductor and the band were interrupted and made aware of their presence.\n\nDisguised as an attack by pressure pirates and orchestrated by the Green Forge eco-terrorist organization, the group intended to use the ship to destroy the Yorn Skot gas mines owned by wealthy business being Clode Rhoden. Due to the attack, the passengers of the beleaguered ship were ordered to evacuate. The evacuation was carried out in an orderly fashion, with the passengers assigned to various life pods by number. During the evacuation, the conductor was still directing the band, and inquired as to whether or not they should play another song. The maestro was asked by the cephalopod musicians if the ship had life pods large enough to support them, to which the insectoid replied that such a design feature was assumed. The band leader was interrupted by a boarding call that announced the insectoid's assigned life pod. The conductor bid the band good luck and hurried to evacuate.\n\nLater, the conductor was reunited with the band aboard a Galactic Republic rescue frigate. The insectoid rushed to greet the bandmates, who appeared irritated.\n\n",

No one knows if Evazan ever obtained a true medical degree. Nonetheless, he was remembered as a promising surgeon. His application to the Imperial Academy was rejected when his innate madness was revealed during an interview, and he was shipped off to the prison on Delrian. Evazan escaped to the Hindasar system, where he established his own \"practice\" specializing in cyborging and inexpensive surgery. Once the medical and law-enforcement authorities caught up with him, he disappeared to another system, where he began his operations anew. He would repeat this process on several worlds, with occasional forays into spice smuggling, slaving, assassination, and other crimes. He never stayed in one location too long, and his movement from planet to planet helped him gain more and more victims.\n\nHis legacy of victims led him to be pursued by the bounty hunter Jodo Kast, who nearly caught up to him in the Corellian system. Thanks to the intervention of the Aqualish thug Ponda Baba, Evazan escaped, but not before one of Jodo Kast's blaster shots caught him in the face. Evazan was scarred for life, but he and Baba formed a beneficial partnership.\n\n",

In this period of time, he gave his pod to his chief mechanic Braittrand, who modified the racer, and used it in further competitions.\n\nTen years after the race, Roor had became a legend on his homeworld of Sneeve. He abandoned his retirement to publicly support Senator Jollin Resbin of Sneeve, a proponent of the Military Creation Act during the Separatist Crisis. Roor appeared in a series of holographic endorsements and ran in charity races in the Mid Rim to spread Resbin's message in the area. He was scheduled to run in the Dasoor Challenge the same day of the final vote on the Act, weather permitting.\n\n",

        "content": "# Boles Roor - Personality and traits[]\n\nAt 1.6 meters, Boles Roor was relatively short for a Sneevel, who commonly ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 meters in height. Like many others of his species, Roor was shaggy and gave off a pungent smell that was one of his personal trademarks. Another was his powerful voice, which he used to his advantage in his singing career. He was a talented musician whose performing flair made him quite wealthy. When singing glimmik, Roor played a pink instrument with a long neck that he carried nonchalantly.\n\nMany Sneevels felt a need for thrill. Roor was not the only one of his species who resorted to dangerous sports as a way of life. Although a capable, awarded pilot in his prime, recognized as such by critics, Roor's Podracing skills were less competitive by comparison as of 32 BBY, as the pilots he raced against had faster reflexes and the podracing circuit had changed since his times. As such, Roor was never considered to be a main contender to win the Boonta Eve Classic and was generally regarded as a second-rate pilot in comparison to the likes of Sebulba and Gasgano. Nevertheless, Roor considered Podracing little more than a hobby, finding much more interest in his vocation as a musician.\n\nFor the Boonta Eve Race of 32 BBY, Roor chose to use his old Bin Gassi Racing Engines Quadrijet 4-Barrel 904E, even when other, newer and better models were available; Roor was criticized for this decision. Nevertheless, the racer's expensive price tag allowed Roor to show off his wealth. Although most Podracer pilots were also the primary mechanics of their own vehicles as of 32 BBY, at that point Roor had low skills in that field relative to his rivals'. Rather, Roor hired a crew of other beings to maintain his pod. When piloting, Roor wore clothes, something he did not do when performing glimmik.\n\nRoor's arrogance and bluster showed itself the night before the Boonta Eve in the Poodoo Lounge when he taunted Ben Quadinaros into accepting a five-million-peggat bet that the former would not enter the race. Roor was subsequently embarrassed by Quadinaros's acceptance of the challenge.\n\n",

He was known to pilot his Bin Gassi Racing Engines Quadrijet 4-Barrel 904E pod. His high-output machine with modified cockpit could reach 790 km/h, and Roor could control it at that speed. Roor was the track favorite of the Zugga Challenge on the planet Mon Gazza, and during his career he twice won the prestigious Boonta Eve Classic on Tatooine. Critics, however, attributed his victories less to any real talent and more to sheer luck.\n\nRoor, who regarded himself a crooner before a racer, concentrated on his vocation as a glimmik singer, achieving a successful career. While Roor raced in full clothes, he was naked when singing or casual. Half-retired from Podracing by the time the highly-successful Dug Sebulba started in the sport, Roor instead sang in distinguished venues such as the Kallarak Amphitheater on Coruscant, a million-seat hall that regularly sold out for each performance.\n\nNeglecting his vehicle's upkeep, Roor hired a crew of Ishi Tibs to perform maintenance tasks while he was singing. At some point, he also hired Shrivel Braittrand, a Kulless, as his chief mechanic. Even with their work, the pod began to suffer: its dual combustion chambers failed to cool properly, its internal components were replaced by sub-par substitutes when needed, and the soldered seams were of poor quality. The racer also had low quality welding in its left engine.\n\n",

Her HoloNet performances were watched by millions, while her humanitarian and environmental work inspired her most devoted fans. The Malita Tal Environmentalism Award for preserving and restoring natural ecosystems of Zakuul was created in her honor. Following the assassination of Valkorion in 3636 BBY, his son Arcann took the throne. Malita was one of the first on Zakuul to loudly question his rule. Her fans organized a protest against Arcann and soon evidence of terrorist correspondence in her personal holoterminal was discovered by Zakuul officials, who may have planted the evidence themselves. Malita was forced to flee Zakuul and go into exile on suspicion of treason. Her flight divided her fanbase. Some ruled her a traitor, while others hoped she would come back.\n\nIn 3631 BBY an Alliance was formed against Arcann from former Republic and Imperial forces. Malita and others wanted to join, but its location was well hidden. Eventually she found Galactic Republic Senator Tai Cordan and Imperial Admiral Zasha Ranken, the three of them decided to start an Alliance of their own. However, they were soon found out and captured. En route to Zakuul, the Eternal Fleet warship that was transporting them was boarded in 3630 BBY by Alliance forces consisting of Senya Tirall, Lana Beniko, Theron Shan and The Alliance Commander. They found and released the prisoners, but on their way to the escape pods the GEMINI captain of the vessel initiated the self-destruct sequence. Tal and her bodyguards were trapped in the escape pod that would not launch, just like the other two groups. Theron Shan was able to launch two of three pods remotely, before the remaining one exploded, killing everyone on board.\n\n",

        "content": "# Maximilian Rebo - Behind the scenes[]\n\nMax Rebo first appeared in the 1983 Star Wars film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. While at times described as such, Rebo was not a puppet but instead a costume; performer Simon Williamson needed to sit within the suit to play the character. Williamson got the part after the character he was originally set to play, Sic-Six, was cut from the film. Shown the Rebo costume as an alternative part he could claim by Phil Tippett, Williamson described seeing Rebo as a \"blue vision of loveliness\" and felt a great need to play him. The 2016 young reader's Canon reference book The Amazing Book of Star Wars misspells his last name as \"Reebo.\"\n\nRebo's design in the non-canon 2022 video game LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga re-uses the design for his minifigure in the Star Wars Legends-era LEGO Classic Star Wars set 75020 Jabba's Sail Barge. As a result, the character is depicted with a pair of arms instead of only legs, in line with Ortolans from the Legends continuity, as opposed to Canon Ortolans which possess only legs.\n\n",

        "content": "# Boles Roor - Boonta Eve Classic, 32 BBY[]\n\nAfter an important leave from the Podracing pro circuit, Roor returned to the Boonta Eve Classic for the race of 32 BBY. He was not the only old-timer in the race, but both his vehicle and his skills had grown rusty, and the racing scene had evolved without his knowing. Even then, Roor refused to replace his out-of-date pod.\n\nThe day before the race, Roor and some of the Boonta Eve favorites, including the Xexto Gasgano, the Gran Mawhonic, the Nosaurian Clegg Holdfast, and Sebulba, were featured in the Fode and Beed Show, the talk show of race commentator Fodesinbeed Annodue. Sebulba taunted each of his challengers during the program, with Roor being the only one to reply to him. Roor also announced a glimmik performance for that same night during the show. While on Tatooine, Roor patronized the food stand operated by Gragra, the Swokes Swokes gorgmonger.\n\nOn the night before the Boonta, Roor gave his glimmik show in the Poodoo Lounge, in the city of Mos Espa. During his act, Roor arrogantly and noisily taunted the rookie Toong pilot Ben Quadinaros, wagering five million peggats that a cowardly Toong like Quadinaros wouldn't enter the race. To everybody's surprise, including himself, Quadinaros accepted. Roor avoided public embarrassment by dedicating his first song to Quadinaros, and continued with a loud concert.\n\nIn the Boonta Race, Roor was upset to see Quadinaros in the eighteenth starting block from Roor's own tenth post. By then, his bet with the Toong was public knowledge. However, Quadinaros's quickly-rented BT310 quadra-Podracer was sabotaged by another pilot, Ark Roose, who was trying to damage Anakin Skywalker's vehicle. As a result, Quadinaros never advanced past the starting block, nevertheless winning his bet.\n\nMeanwhile, Roor was racing at high speed. He finished the race in sixth place, with a total time of 16:42:473 and an average speed of 781 km/h. His rival Sebulba did not even finish the race, as he crashed before reaching the finish, while the victory went to the young Skywalker. During a party after the race, Roor's bet with Quadinaros was the talk of the pilots. Roor was disgruntled, but promptly paid Quadinaros his money.\n\n",

Aside from Elinda, the band consisted of the Bith Ujaa as musical director and his brother Ujii. Elinda, however, threatened to leave the band when she found Ujaa to be a terrible musician. In order not to lose her, Gilthos dismissed Ujaa immediately and hired Loopa as his replacement. As Ujaa's brother, Ujii was upset by this development and retired from the band, resulting in another Bith Fodo taking his place.\n\nThe band became increasingly successful following this, and Elinda's voice was especially popular her homeworld. During the Jedi Civil War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the band gained enough renown to attract the attention of the local businessman named Davik Kang, who invited them to perform at his estate. Thrilled at the prospect of performing for such a powerful man, Uksaris saw this as the band's big break. Elinda did not share in his excitement. Having heard valid rumors concerning Kang's connections to the crime syndicate the Exchange, she feared for her life should she have any dealings with Davik Kang. Unable to persuade her to accept the invitation, Uksaris hired her sister Ashana on the eve of their scheduled performance, a plan that was risky given Ashana's untested singing.\n\nWhile visiting the Lower City Apartments during the Sith quarantine of Taris, Revan discovered a security crate delivered to Gilthos Uksaris protected by a Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive. In unlocking the crate, he was required to activate the holoprojectors of each member of The Twisted Rancor Trio in order of their recruitment to it. Through a datapad nearby within which held the contents of brief history of the band, Revan learned of the story of Elinda and the other members of the band and used this as a guide to safely unlock the footlocker.\n\n",

The droid found Ken discussing with Luke Skywalker, a modern-day Jedi and hero of the Rebel Alliance. DJ-88 knew of Skywalker, but the droid didn't immediately agreed to let Ken go with him, despite the boy's eagerness to join the Alliance. The caretaker robot raised his hands and filled the air with a blinding smoke, which allowed him to take the Prince back to the city unnoticed. Some time later, Ken once more escaped, hitting the Topworld during an Imperial attack which was burning the forests to the ground. DJ-88 went to the rescue of his pupil, and he encountered the heroes of the Rebellion. Now properly introduced, Skywalker and DJ-88 decided to work together in hopes of putting an end to the fires. When the battle was over, the old droid admitted it was time for Ken to explore the wider galaxy, and allowed Luke Skywalker to take the child with him.\n\nHowever, Skywalker and Ken were captured by stormtroopers while on a quest in the mushroom forests of Arzid. They were taken to the members of the Church of the Dark Side, a sham religion supposedly made up of the Prophets of the Dark Side. Their leader, a Bimm impersonator posing as the Supreme Prophet Kadann, planned to steal the ancient knowledge of the Jedi that was contained in the Lost City's library, and tempted the young Jedi Prince into revealing the location of the Lost City of the Jedi. Eager to learn about his origins, Ken betrayed his city and brought the Prophets to it. When the droid DJ-88 saw the Imperials storming the library, he asked Ken about the motivation of his betrayal. As all seemed lost, the caretaker droid decided the time had come to tell the truth. DJ-88 revealed the Jedi Prince's frightful origin story in considerable detail. Not wanting to believe it, Ken started crying, pounding on Dee-Jay's chest. The old droid tried to console his pupil, and the Kadann impersonator then ordered to deactivate the caretaker droid. An Imperial agent swiftly reacted, opening a panel in the old droid's back and deactivating him. DJ-88 stood silent and motionless.\n\n",

The Jedi, wishing to repair the damage done to Yavin 4's environment, established an underground city, the function of which was to restore the moon's ecosystem. When all the Jedi Knights left the city for good, the library and weather station were entrusted to the good care of droids. This location, now known as the Lost City of the Jedi, was run entirely by artificial intelligence for millennia, with older droids building newer ones as they aged.\n\nA few years before the start of the Galactic Civil War, the already ancient but powerful DJ-88 was in charge of the Lost City of the Jedi, serving both as caretaker and teacher. At some point, an unidentified Jedi Master concealed behind brown robes reached the fourth moon of Yavin, bringing the infant Ken with him. Ken was the baby son of Triclops, Emperor Palpatine's own offspring, and the Jedi Princess Kendalina, who had been killed by the Galactic Empire. DJ-88 was instructed to raise Ken and educate him. The chief caretaker droid fulfilled his mandate conscientiously, teaching the young boy ecology, astronomy, computers, and about fifteen other subjects.\n\nFor about twelve years, DJ-88 educated and protected Ken the best way he could, in hopes that the boy's Jedi heritage could win out over the dark side that was also a part of his heritage. The white droid chose not to reveal the terrible truth to his pupil, as knowing he was the grandson of Emperor Palpatine would have have left him with irreparable trauma. The secrets of Ken's origins had to be kept until the prince became a grown man\u2014old enough to face the truth.\n\n",

In it, sheet music and its lyrics are provided with a background image of the all-Bith band Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes from the film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in the book is non-canonical.\n\nThe song was later made canonical in the second part of a series of posts on The Official Star Wars Blog called Slugthrowers: An Overview of Popular Music and Musicians in a Galaxy Far, Far Away, written by Ed Erdelac. In it, it was revealed that the song was released as a single by the Bith trio The Vortices. The blog post misspelt the song name as \"If I Could Only Let Go And Cry.\"\n\n",

Both of the young Je'daii were drawn to Bodhi Temple where the Force exposed their natural talents in the arts. A talented musician with a speciality for prose and poetry, she was on the track to become a Je'daii of some renown. Years after their Journey ended, she and her husband became the parents of Lanoree and Dalien Brock. Living in the Je'daii settlement surrounding the Temple of Arts, Brock taught at Bodhi, and in the evenings would read poetry to her children before they slept. When her children were growing up, she would teach them the basics of touching another's mind and the survival skills necessary to live on Tython.\n\nDuring the war between Tython and Despot Queen Hadiya and her army, Brock served some of his time on the planet Nox where the fighting was especially vicious. Following the war and the supposed death of her son, Brock comforted her daughter at Dalien's memorial ritual by assuring her that not everyone completed their Journey. Afterwards, she rarely saw her daughter, who had become a Je'daii Ranger by the time of Dalien's reemergence during the Stargazer Uprising. Following the Stargazer Uprising, Lanoree returned to Bodhi Temple and to her parents' house for her brother's second Remembrance Ceremony after she had killed him in service to the Order.\n\n",

The voxyn began ravaging Jedi ranks at the beginning of 27 ABY. With the Order in crisis, Jedi Knights mobilized to combat the threat. Ulaha Kore accompanied a squadron of Jedi to Froz, where it was believed the Yuuzhan Vong would attempt to attack one of Jedi Master Kyp Durron's supply bases with voxyn. A mission was organized by Anakin Solo in order to obtain voxyn for study at the Froz system, where it was believed the Yuuzhan Vong would soon release more of the creatures. Kore accompanied Solo's squadron aboard a converted blastboat named the Big Eye, along with fellow Jedi Tenel Ka, Raynar Thul and Lowbacca. Kore was assigned the call sign \"Minstrel.\" The role of the team on the Big Eye was to provide tactical analysis and information.\n\nAs Kore and her fellow Jedi awaited the arrival of voxyn in the system, which they would be able to sense by use of the Force, the team aboard the Big Eye observed the arrival of Speed Queen, a freighter that was quickly set upon by a Yuuzhan Vong interdictor. As it was not the mandate of the mission to rescue civilian vessels, Solo ordered the team to hold their positions. Aboard the Big Eye, however, Kore and the others witnessed as Kyp's Dozen, a starfighter squadron led by Jedi Master Kyp Durron, arrived to combat the Yuuzhan Vong. Durron's squadron defeated the Yuuzhan Vong force and rescued Speed Queen, although moments later three Yuuzhan Vong assault frigates emerged in the system and surrounded Durron's squadron, forcing Anakin Solo to tip his hand and engage the frigates.\n\nFollowing the mission to Froz, the Jedi continued to work to capture voxyn for study. Ulaha Kore paired with Eryl Besa, a Human Jedi, with whom she was able to secure another voxyn and return it to Cilghal at the secret Jedi base located over the planet Eclipse. Once Cilghal had researched the voxyn further and drawn conclusions from her studies, Luke Skywalker summoned several Jedi, Kore included, to Eclipse Station in order to announce Cilghal's findings. The Mon Calamari revealed that in the stomach of the voxyn recovered by Kore and Besa she had discovered evidence indicating that the creature had been bred on Myrkr, a conquered planet deep in Yuuzhan Vong territory. Kore was quick to analyze the chances of a full frontal assault on the world and concluded that such an approach would be doomed to failure, even if the Jedi were able to assemble a large enough fleet.\n\nIt was Anakin Solo who proposed that in order to infiltrate Myrkr, a team of Jedi would have to be surrendered into Yuuzhan Vong custody, whereupon they could be transported across the frontier of occupied territory before commandeering the vessel and traveling to the Myrkr system.\n\n",

        "content": "# Grael - Escape from Balis-Baurgh[]\n\nThough he had been stripped of his weapons, Grael still had possession of his flute, and over time he began to mimic the tunes used by the Programmer Droid to assign tasks to the other droids. When he was confident he had replicated the tune to command the droids to bring the meat to the one cell who was allowed it, he attempted to get the droid to bring the meat to him, though his initial attempt failed. He tried again, though, in the morning, on the way to the exercise chamber, ambushing the droid in the corridor. The droid did not react, and he believed that he'd outsmarted it; halfway through his meal, however, one of the security droids aimed a blaster at him. He offered his food to the droid, though it refused and stated that he was out of bounds; the appropriate punishment was execution.\n\nFortunately for Grael, he managed to play the right tune just in time, deactivating the droid. From his cell, Turner saw an astromech droid enter the chamber, and realized that a ship must have docked with the prison complex. Grael was able to release Turner by ordering the droid to open the door to his cell with his flute, though he did not know the right tunes for Becker and Lon's cells. Turner, realizing there would not be time to learn the correct notes, opted to try to escape and to return to Balis-Baurgh at a later time, with help from the Rebellion. They made their way toward the ship, but were pursued by security droids and stormtroopers. Grael eventually used his flute to order the droid pilot to lift off, and they escaped, bound for the Rebel fleet at Sullust.\n\nThey arrived at Sullust to find the Rebel fleet missing; they tracked it to Endor, where a great battle had just ended, with the Alliance victorious against the Empire, with the help of the Ewoks. Grael and Turner participated in the celebrations that followed, before the Ewok warrior returned to his village to tell his family and tribe of his exploits. He told Ponto his story many, many times, though they eventually had to part ways. Turner and Grael organized a commando mission to Balis-Baurgh to rescue the remaining Rebels. They were successful, and Grael continued to serve the New Republic with Turner many times. He did not forget his family, though, and often returned home to tell his son his tale yet another time.\n\n",

Kore was featured once again in the subsequent installment of The New Jedi Order series, The New Jedi Order: Balance Point, which was written by Kathy Tyers. In The New Jedi Order: Star by Star, author Troy Denning expanded upon Kore's character in more detail, although the Bith Jedi was killed off in the Mission to Myrkr plotline. Kore's statistics for the Star Wars roleplaying game were later included in The New Jedi Order Sourcebook and the Bith later received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008. In 1997, the Bantam Spectra novel Planet of Twilight had made passing reference to a new Bith student Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum.

Accompanying the strike team as an analyst and tactician, Kore was severely wounded during the insertion into Yuuzhan Vong territory and was subsequently tortured extensively as the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to break the spirit of the Bith and her companions. Although the strike team was able to seize control of the Yuuzhan Vong vessel aboard which they had been incarcerated, Kore was too badly injured to accompany the team to the voxyn cloning facility. The dying Bith musician instead sacrificed herself to bolster the mission's chances of success.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ulaha Kore - Wartime Jedi[]\n\nA female Bith, Ulaha Kore was Force-sensitive and was trained as a Jedi in Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. Alongside her innate ability to manipulate the Force, Kore was also a talented musician, an inherent gift that secured her invitations to elite social gatherings throughout her life. Kore's training was successful and she constructed her own lightsaber and achieved the rank of Jedi Knight. In 25 ABY, the galaxy and its reigning galactic government, the New Republic, was invaded by a race of extragalactic beings known as the Yuuzhan Vong, who waged a holy crusade against the inhabitants of the galaxy and sought to take it as their own. Both the Jedi and the New Republic suffered losses throughout the opening months of the war as the Yuuzhan Vong advanced from the Outer Rim Territories upon the Core Worlds. The Jedi lost much of the public's faith following the destruction of Ithor, which was blamed on Jedi Master Corran Horn.\n\nIn 25.7 ABY, Kore was present at the Jedi Praxeum on the moon Yavin 4 when a smuggler, Talon Karrde, arrived to deliver important information concerning the Yuuzhan Vong advance. Karrde had ascertained that following a peace accord between Hutt Space and the Yuuzhan Vong, the trade of spice to key systems such as the Corellian system, the Tynnani system and Bothan sector had ceased, leading Karrde to believe that the Yuuzhan Vong planned to attack one of those three locations imminently. Kore was uncertain as to why Karrde had approached the Jedi with this information rather than the New Republic Defense Force or the upper echelons of the government; the smuggler answered that the public image of the Jedi had been tarnished following the destruction of Ithor and that by procuring intelligence on the invaders' next target the Jedi could recoup their losses. In fact, the Yuuzhan Vong had ensured the cessation of the spice trade to Corellia, Tynna and Bothawui as part of a ruse to draw attention to those areas so that they could launch a sneak attack on Fondor, where the New Republic suffered a heavy defeat a short time after Karrde delivered his information.\n\nFollowing the defeat at Fondor, the Yuuzhan Vong made advances along the Corellian Run toward the Inner Rim and the Core Worlds. Jedi Master Skywalker regularly began convening meetings of Jedi on the galactic capital of Coruscant in order that strategy could be discussed. An expert mathematician, Kore often sat in on the strategy sessions along with a number of other Jedi. At one such meeting, Kore listened as Skywalker took reports from a selection of Jedi on a balcony in Coruscant's government district. The assembled Jedi commented upon and discussed the progress of the Yuuzhan Vong War, with Kore observing that the invaders had not yet made any advance upon the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, despite its proximity to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion corridor. The meeting concluded shortly afterwards; within the next few weeks, the New Republic suffered another major defeat at the planet Duro, where the Yuuzhan Vong warmaster, Tsavong Lah, delivered a galaxy-wide message demanding the surrender of the Jedi Order to his species.\n\n",

A native of Tribe Panshee village on the Forest Moon of Endor, he was named after an Ewok deity, and was a devout follower of the way of the Tree Spirits. He was a skilled hunter, often leading expeditions or hunting solo with great success. Although he did not know it, the Force guided him while hunting, letting him know his prey's location.\n\nIn 4 ABY, he encountered Rebel Captain Junas Turner by chance while hunting, and the two were captured by Imperial stormtroopers. They were transported to the prison facility at Balis-Baurgh, where Grael slowly learned Basic from Turner and several of his Rebel allies. Eventually, Grael realized he was able to use his flute to command the droids who maintained the prison, and he had them free himself and Turner, though he could not rescue the other Rebels. They commandeered a starship and traveled to Sullust, hoping to warn the Rebel fleet of the second Death Star. By the time they arrived, however, the Rebels had already engaged the Death Star at Endor, and destroyed it. Grael returned home to his family, before partaking in many Rebel and New Republic missions with Turner.\n\n",

This serious injury caused the Yuuzhan Vong commander to target her during an attempt to break the Jedi: he stroked the Bith's delicate hands several times across a voxyn's scales. The other Jedi tried to prolong their torture sessions to give the Bith time to recover in a healing trance. Jaina Solo couldn't stand the Bith being in pain and so finally admitted that a Jedi base existed. Before Ulaha could be tortured even further, Anakin Solo ordered her to give the name of the base to stop her torment. She disobeyed and, gathering strength from the Battle meld, killed the voxyn with a coufee and many other Yuuzhan Vong from its acid. Jacen Solo and the others assumed Anakin had ordered her to kill the voxyn.\n\nUlaha later sacrificed herself to destroy an enemy boarding party onboard the worldship orbiting Myrkr, and became thus the first to die on the mission. As she died, she played a melody using a metal tube; Jaina commented that she wished Tionne could have heard it.\n\nThe Bith musician's sacrifice enabled the Jedi strike team to insert themselves onto the Baanu Rass and begin the long process of locating and eliminating the voxyn queen. Ultimately, Kore was the first of six Jedi who died on the mission which, although eventually successful, had great repercussions upon its survivors. On the waterworld of Dac, where the New Republic established its new capital in 28 ABY following the fall of Coruscant to the Yuuzhan Vong, Kore was honored posthumously in a ceremony presided over by Chief of State Cal Omas.\n\n",

He was able to deal with creatures far larger than himself without serious harm, and he considered his abilities to be equal to or better than that of five lesser Ewok warriors. Like many Ewoks, he was also very curious and inquisitive, as well as religious: he attributed all good luck that came his way to have been sent by the Ewok gods, and thought that the Humans he encountered in the forest were omens. He cared deeply about his family, both his son and his wife, and felt bad when leaving them, though his primary concern was his stomach. His first impulse when he encountered Junas Turner was to see how he tasted, and he later risked his life on Balis-Baurgh for a thick slice of juicy meat.\n\nLiving in such a primitive and isolated society, Grael had virtually no knowledge about the outside universe, and he believed things such as blasters and droids to all be part of nature. However, he was a fast learner, picking up Basic and the droid melodies in just a few days. He was also na\u00efve, believing that his capture might have simply been a mistake. Grael was mildly Force-sensitive, and could sense other life forms often before he could see them. However, his abilities were untrained and unfocused, and no one fully understood them\u2014least of all Grael himself.\n\n",

There, he was introduced to a golden protocol droid, which was fluent in Ewokese. Grael told the droid who he was, trying to explain that his capture was all a mix-up, and asked the droid if it would sort it out. The protocol droid informed him that he was an enemy of Tribe Empire, and that he was being imprisoned; if he performed as requested, injury would not be inflicted upon him. He was separated from Turner and escorted to his cell. From there, he was able to look through a grated window into a large chamber beyond, where a 4XB Programmer Droid was issuing instructions to L2 Base Labor Droids and K5 Enforcer Droids. Grael watched with interest as the Programmer Droid used short musical tunes to instruct the others, before eventually succumbing to his fatigue and drifting asleep in his cell.\n\nHe was given breakfast in the morning, though the fetid bread he was given did little to sustain his appetite. He noticed one of the Labor Droids bring a large chunk of meat to another cell with dismay, yearning to have some proper food for himself. Later in the day, an Enforcer Droid took him to the exercise chamber, where he saw a multitude of alien species, none of which he had seen before. Grael spotted Turner across the chamber, and waved to him; in doing so, however, he inadvertently made contact with a large creature's tentaclepit, which caused a brawl between the creature and another, tusked being. Grael took the chance to sneak over to Turner, who was with two other Humans, Becker and Lon. Turner welcomed Grael and allowed him to listen in on their conversations in an attempt to pick up Basic when he was not completing tasks assigned to him by the droids.\n\nGrael's routine continued for many days, until he could communicate with his Human friends in reasonable Basic. Turner explained to him that the three of them were members of Tribe Rebellion, who opposed Tribe Empire and attempted to stop them committing what they saw as heinous crimes. He also informed Grael that he had discovered that the Empire was constructing the second Death Star on Endor, and wished to return to the Rebel fleet at Sullust to warn them. Grael sympathized with the Rebellion, and hoped that he could persuade his tribe to help in the struggle against the Empire.\n\n",

His name was common among Ewoks, as Grael was a deity in Ewok mythology, believed to be the wind that carried the scent of smoke to Ewoks, warning them of fires on their native moon. Grael the Ewok was a member of Tribe Panshee, and lived in Tribe Panshee village, built high on the trees for protection from the predators who stalked the surface. A revered warrior, he led many tribal hunts into the depths of the Endor forest, clashing with fierce creatures; he was usually successful, and those under his command rarely lost their lives during his regular expeditions. Before long, he had fashioned himself a personal spear and became one of the leading males of his tribe; he married, and fathered a child named Ponto.\n\nGrael often went on solo hunts for days at a time, despite the fact that few Ewoks survived such expeditions. He thought his abilities as tantamount to those of at least five Panshee warriors; unlike most of his comrades, he was possessed of cunning and intelligence uncharacteristic of the simple Ewoks. However, these were not his only talents: he was blessed with a latent Force-sensitivity, which allowed him to view glimpses of the future and to locate his prey with ease. He knew nothing of the Force, and believed that it was the Tree Spirits of Ewok lore who guided him. Thus, he was devoutly religious, attending all ceremonies and rituals conducted by Shaman Rakra and his comrades and staying strict to the path of the Tree Spirits. He was also a talented musician, often performing after a successful hunt. He carried with him a flute everywhere he went. Despite his standing among his peers and clan, Grael had never met a member of another sentient species well into his adult years, and remained completely unaware of the greater galaxy.\n\n",

        "content": "# Grael - Chance encounter[]\n\nAround 4 ABY, Grael went on a solo hunt, hoping to capture a Yootak, one of Endor's most deadly predators, to bring back to his village. After two days of traveling, he picked up the scent of a Yootak and pursued it for a time. When that was unsuccessful, he opted to set a trap for the predator, catching a gunlabird, one of the Yootak's favored prey, and tethering it to a snare trap located in the center of a small clearing. Grael hid in a nearby bush and waited for his prey to arrive. He eventually sensed the creature approaching through the Force, but it was cautious, slow, and he suspected that it had detected the trap. Before it came into his line of sight, however, another creature arrived at the clearing from the opposite side: twice the height of the Ewok, it was smooth-skinned, and holding a small black stick. It was Captain Junas Turner, a Human, and he was holding a blaster, though Grael had never witnessed Humans or blasters before, and was unaware of the capability of either.\n\nThe Yootak arrived moments later, attacking Turner; Grael, hoping to take advantage of the creature's distraction, charged at it with his spear, though the powerful Yootak sent Turner sprawling toward him. In an effort to avoid colliding with the Human, Grael inadvertently snared himself in his own trap. He and his prey clashed, but Turner killed the Yootak by firing his blaster at its chest. Unfamiliar with such advanced technology, Grael assumed it had been his weapon to deal the killing blow. He cut himself free, and he and Turner attempted to communicate, though they only got as far as telling each other their names\u2014Grael spoke only Ewokese, and Turner Basic. Grael's thoughts started to wander toward killing Turner and eating him, though he decided that a \"talking animal\" may have been an omen sent by the Ewok deities, and he chose to bring him to Shaman Rakra at the village for examination. If he wasn't an omen, Grael figured, then at least the village could see what he tasted like.\n\nWith little effort, he persuaded Turner to follow him toward Tribe Panshee village, offering him water and rations along the way. They journeyed till dusk; Grael slept in his hammock high up on tree branches, while Turner\u2014who was afraid of heights\u2014opted to sleep in his tent. They continued on their journey in the morning, though things soon went awry: the duo were ambushed by what Grael perceived as shiny, white talking creatures, who were in actual fact Imperial stormtroopers. Turner surrendered his weapon, and the Imperials bound the two travelers and took them to their camp. Grael was shocked by the lack of trees and vegetation in the area, before realizing that the trees had been cut down by \"black creatures with long arms\"\u2014huge machines that tore down the trees en masse. It appalled him that they were cutting down trees without having first performed the compulsory Ritual of the Children, though his attempts to break his bonds failed.\n\n",

The club was situated in a less developed area of the district and did not garner as much attention from the police, a fact that worked in the club's favor. Its labyrinth of bars, gambling rooms and sleeping quarters allowed for a wide variety of visitors and entertainment. In the center was a large bar, usually crowded, that catered to all parts of Coruscant's society. Jedi Knights Kenobi and Skywalker pursued bounty hunter Zam Wesell into the Uscru District after her attempted assassination of Senator Amidala. The pursuit ended in the Outlander Club, where the Jedi located the assassin. However, Wesell was killed by bounty hunter Jango Fett in an alley outside the club before the Jedi could finish questioning her.\n\n",

        "content": "# Tionne Solusar - Jedi Knight[]\n\nWhile at a spaceport on Ord Mantell, Tionne received a tip about the location of the ancient Jedi city of Exis Station. Unable to pay her informant, she told him to share the information with Luke Skywalker, who was reforming the Jedi Order and would be willing to pay for the information.\n\nSkywalker later met up with Tionne at Exis Station, and the two made an escape from the collapsing station. Luke sensed that Tionne was not very strong in the Force, but nevertheless possessed some potential. He invited her to join his budding Jedi academy on Yavin 4.\n\nDespite the fact that her powers were limited, Tionne worked hard and attained the rank of Jedi Knight. She spent nearly a year searching for the spiral mist-horn and crystal-pearl that she used to construct her lightsaber.\n\nTionne's role at the Jedi Praxeum was that of Jedi historian, and she would often teach the trainees stories of ancient Jedi through singing while accompanying herself with her grandmother's viol. She wrote a number of original ballads, such as the Ballad of Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, the Ballad of the Jedi Mechanic, and the Ballad of Nomi Sunrider.\n\nIn addition to teaching at the academy, Tionne undertook research trips every few months, seeking whatever knowledge she could find about the history of the Jedi. She often returned with stories, songs, Twi'lek story-chains, tapestries, and other artifacts. Tionne's methods contrasted with other Jedi, some of whom stole artifacts, believing the Order had the rightful claim to any discoveries. This brought the Order into disrepute within archaeological circles, as evidenced by the suspicion of Dr. Anki Pace and her team on Bimmiel. Tionne, however, never adopted this arrogant attitude. Indeed, one of her most valuable acquisitions was Arca Jeth's holocron, a gift from archaeologists on Arkania.\n\nTionne's knowledge also extended to Sith artifacts. She researched the Leviathan on Corbos to aid the Jedi mission there, and later investigated the Hssiss on Vjun.\n\nDuring Captain Gilad Pellaeon's raid on the Yavin Academy, Tionne aided in the fighting by informing the other Jedi as to the number of enemy capital ships and their class. In addition, she monitored the Academy communication stations and was the one to discover the Imperial jamming. Tionne also aided Luke by using the Force to hurl a tree into an Imperial Flying Fortress, destroying it.\n\nDuring the New Jedi Order's conflict with the Cult of Ragnos, Tionne contributed her knowledge of Sith lore to research into the Scepter of Ragnos. She later assisted her fellow Jedi in tracking the movements of Tavion Axmis.\n\nIn 14 ABY, During the Disciples of Ragnos crisis, Tionne was dispatched with Streen to investigate locations, from which the Disciples may have siphoned Force energy.\n\nTionne learned through a holocron of a hidden planet, Yalara. She found that the ancient Jedi Master Broden Kel Verdox had installed a cloaking device to keep the planet hidden from civilization, due to the fact that the indigenous population was too primitive for contact with the wider galaxy. Jaden Korr, apprentice to Kyle Katarn, acted on this information to sabotage Imperial activities on Yalara.\n\nWhile the Galactic Civil War slowed down in its later years, Tionne would also preside over the newly restored Jedi Archives on Coruscant. Here, she compiled a history of the Rebel Alliance for the records and researched the relatively low-key history of the Renegade Squadron.\n\n",

        "content": "# Tionne Solusar - Jedi teacher[]\n\nIn 22 ABY, Tionne acquired a Jemlaat-class yacht from a Randoni trader during one of her frequent research trips to Borgo Prime, literally for the price of a song about the first Randoni merchants and where they hid their treasures. She christened the yacht Lore Seeker and made it her personal transport. She often took young Jedi trainees with her on these trips, using it as an opportunity to provide them with practical experience.\n\nLater that year, Tionne discovered that Darth Vader had saved Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber after their duel on the First Death Star in 0 BBY and kept the captured artifact at Bast Castle on Vjun. Since an information broker had sold this information to her, she rightly feared that treasure-hunters would attempt to snatch the lightsaber first and quickly alerted Luke. Thinking it was just a simple trip and time for training, Tionne allowed Human Jedi trainees Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila, Uldir Lochett and the ancient Kushiban Jedi Master Ikrit to accompany her to Vjun on the Lore Seeker.\n\nHaving arrived on Vjun, they discovered another vessel and feared another group had reached it first. Having survived Bast Castle's automated defense systems, they discovered the lightsaber in a protected alcove. Unfortunately, a group of mercenaries and pirates under a cloaked man named Orloc arrived. Orloc claimed to be a mage who possessed great powers and his henchmen also stole Kenobi's lightsaber.\n\nIn response, the Jedi pursued Orloc and his henchmen on a chase through Bast Castle. During a confrontation, Orloc easily defeated Ikrit in lightsaber combat since the Kushiban had no lightsaber at all. He also deceived Uldir by claiming to train him in all the Force skills he desired. However, the other Jedi managed to rescue Uldir and escape Bast Castle, along with Kenobi's lightsaber and the holocron of the ancient Jedi Master Asli Krimsan.\n\nHaving returned to the Academy, Tionne began researching the holocron. Unfortunately for Uldir, he had become obsessed with what Orloc said during their encounter. Since no one at the Academy had been able to awaken his powers, Uldir stole the two Jedi artifacts along with Ikrit's personal transport Sunrider and then went to find Orloc, believing he could help. He found Orloc at Exis Station, who then recruited the young man and promised to train him as a Jedi. In reality, Orloc had no Force powers and had used technology to deceive others with demonstrations of Force power. However, Uldir did not realize this.\n\nLater, Tionne, Anakin, Tahiri and Ikrit discovered Exis Station and fought Orloc. During the battle, Tionne was injured by Orloc. However, Ikrit, employing Kenobi's lightsaber, joined in the fight. Worse for Orloc, Uldir realized that he had been deceived and aided his Jedi comrades to defeat Orloc. Following that, the Jedi left Exis Station with the two Jedi artifacts, having removed a threat to the New Jedi Order.\n\nDuring her years on Yavin 4, Tionne found love with another of Luke Skywalker's students, Kam Solusar. The two got married in 18 ABY.\n\n",

Fortunately Jaina's danger sense alerted her to the attempted massacre and she was able to escape, alerting her fellow Jedi to the trap. A battle ensued between the GAG and the unarmed Jedi and nearly all the Padawans fell in combat, reminiscent of the raid on the Jedi Temple during Darth Vader's assault almost sixty years previously.\n\nAlthough the Jedi attempted to clear out the Academy, Tionne confronted GAG major called Salle Serpa in an attempt to protect captured Jedi students, however, he surprised her and proceeded to shoot her limbs off with his blaster so that he could incite the Jedi enough to draw them out of hiding. Many Jedi including Kam came out of hiding in an attempt to save Tionne but their attempts were in vain for the Jedi were shot by snipers before they could reach Tionne. By the time Jaina Solo managed to kill all the snipers and arrive, the major had already blasted away Tionne's arm and leg. To incite Jaina further, the major further shortened the remainder of Tionne's arm. The Jedi managed to retake the Academy, and she and her husband survived their injuries and later had prosthetic limbs replace those they had lost. Their injuries were so well healed that it was nearly impossible to tell that they had suffered serious wounds and continued to serve as Masters on the Jedi Council.\n\n",

The facility was originally a Republic military base; constructed in close proximity to the staging areas for Star Destroyers, the Republic Center for Military Operations was designed by Orson Callan Krennic. Outside of the complex was an airfield with Venator-class Star Destroyers, HAVw A6 Juggernauts, and other ships. The First Battle Memorial was located in front of the base's main entrance.\n\nThe base was protected by shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard. Inside was a military prison, the cells had two options for entering. The first was sliding a keycard. The second was pressing a button on the outside of each cell. The cells had ray-shielded doors to make sure prisoners did not escape. Inside each cell was a bed and bowls for water and food. Another area in the prison was a medium circular room with a fairly large computer for scanning people before they entered the base, a crate for weapons and communication devices, and a red button to start the red-alert sequence.\n\nIn the latter half of the war, the prison held Whorm Loathsom, Poggle the Lesser, and Wat Tambor. It was also here that Ahsoka Tano escaped when she was suspected of killing Letta Turmond. Additionally, inside the compound was a military tribunal courtroom, in which the court decided the fate of dangerous criminals. It was a tall room, with platforms extending into its center for the accused, prosecution, and defense. There was seating along its walls for the presiding official, jury, and other trial participants and onlookers.\n\n",

After much bickering, the droids parted ways.\n2) Site of the capture of R2-D2 by Jawas.\n3) Site of the capture of C-3PO by Jawas. Stops 2 and 3 were not in chronological order historically. Glad that he had been saved and unaware of the fate of droids that had been \"rescued\" by Jawas, C-3PO was happy to inform the Jawas of the last known location and direction of his wayward counterpart.\n4) The Lars homestead and moisture farm. After the Battle of Yavin, the Lars moisture farm remained abandoned until Luke Skywalker sold the farm to a spice smuggler named Throgg, who then sold it to the Darklighter family. Consultation of notes on vidmaps of the area indicated that the Darklighters were happy to have some company. However it was unknown whether they tolerated groups of tourists that had come by to see where Luke Skywalker had slept, or where Owen and Beru Lars had been murdered.\n5) Place where Luke Skywalker found R2-D2, was ambushed by Sand people, and was rescued by Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n6) Ben Kenobi's hut. This building was restored and preserved for the Skywalker Tour. However, as of approximately 8 ABY, it was discovered that it had been ransacked and had become a home for various non-sentient creatures.\n7) Site of destroyed Jawa sandcrawler. In spite of the fact that the sandcrawler had essentially disappeared due to the scavenging activities of other Jawas, this site remained historically significant in the context of Skywalker's decision to join the Rebellion.\n8) Mos Eisley.

Concept art for the \"Jabba Rocks\" musical number drawn by concept artist Terryl Whitlatch on January 23, 1996, showed a new Bith member of the Max Rebo Band labeled as \"Figrin D'an,\" with the piece earning a \"Fabulouso\" stamp from Lucas. The number was shot on a reproduction of about one quarter of the original Jabba's throne room set on a Industrial Light & Magic stage.\n\nThe character's mask and costume were designed from the costumes used for the Modal Nodes in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. In the current Star Wars canon, the character was first identified in Music in the Star Wars Galaxy: The Modal Nodes vs. The Max Rebo Band, a StarWars.com article written by Amy Ratcliffe and published on February 24, 2015.

Dembaline became a composer at some point prior to the Clone Wars and produced a number of works that were notable in the galaxy, one of the more prominent being the song \"Shwock Dubllon,\" a timeless masterpiece that served as most species' first exposure to Mon Calamari diaspora and was considered one of Dac's most significant contributions to galactic culture. Translated into Galactic Basic Standard, \"Shwock Dubllon\" meant \"Crested Wake,\" and it was known as a rousing, dramatic piece.\n\nIn 22 BBY, the musician Gaeriel Capens released to renewed acclaim a remix of \"Shwock Dubllon.\" HoloNet News CoCo District Edition later published about the remix, detailing that it was produced with the aid of RetSpan Audionics TribBot mimic droids. Dembaline's music remained popular following the Clone Wars and into the period of the Yuuzhan Vong War, which began in 25 ABY. A New Republic starfighter squadron dedicated to tracking down pirates and smugglers in the Outer Rim Territories, known as the Dozen-and-Two Avengers and led by Jedi Master Kyp Durron, adopted \"Shwock Dubllon\" as its unofficial theme song.\n\n",

        "content": "# BD-1 - Biography[]\n\nThe BD explorer droid designated BD-1 was an exploration droid. Prior to the end of the Galactic Republic's reign, the programmed droid accompanied Jedi Master Eno Cordova on the Jedi's journey to explore the history of the Zeffo. Cordova later realized that they were in danger, and programmed BD-1's memory to be blocked, only revealed by someone the droid trusted.\n\nBD-1 then remained on Bogano in the vicinity of the Zeffo Vault until 14 BBY, when the Padawan Cal Kestis, a survivor of Order 66, arrived on the planet at the behest of Cere Junda in order to find a holocron key to rebuilding the Jedi Order. Kestis quickly gained the support of BD-1, and they entered the vault. Along the way, the droid's scomp link was broken by the local wildlife. Unable to unlock the deepest reaches, Kestis took the droid back to his starship and crew, the Stinger Mantis.\n\nThey then traveled to other worlds on their quest to uncover the secrets of the Vault and that of the Zeffo. BD-1 scanned other Zeffo artifacts, showing recordings of Cordova to Kestis. When they were confronted on Zeffo by the Second Sister, BD-1 activated a force field between the combatants, saving Kestis' life. During their journey, Kestis upgraded BD-1 with several different gadgets to assist them, and also repaired the scomp link.\n\nDuring their exploration of Zeffo, Kestis was stunned by a Haxion Brood droid bounty hunter, and both he and BD-1 were imprisoned on Ordo Eris. Kestis broke them both out, and they were rescued by the Mantis.\n\nFollowing a Force vision on Dathomir that left the Jedi's lightsaber damaged, they traveled to Ilum for a new kyber crystal. After battling Imperial forces guarding the cave, Kestis finally acquired a new crystal, only for it to break in his hands. The Padawan almost gave in to despair, but with BD-1's support, rallied and completed his new lightsaber. BD-1 was then able to unlock his memory, showing the recording of Cordova.\n\nKestis then returned to Bogano and gathered the holocron, but it was stolen by the Second Sister, and the Mantis crew followed her to the Fortress Inquisitorius. BD-1 traveled underwater with Kestis to the fortress. They recovered the holocron, but were confronted by Darth Vader. The droid charged the Sith Lord and delivered a shock, but Vader shrugged it off. They only escaped by breaking the tunnel and escaping in the onrush of water. Once back aboard their ship, Kestis decided to destroy the holocron to prevent the Galactic Empire from finding the young Force-sensitives, and then asked the crew of their next destination.\n\nBD-1 continued to accompany Kestis on his adventures. On Coruscant, Kestis was on a mission to retrieve military intel from Daho Sejan yacht, and BD-1 assisted in hijacking the yacht and freeing Kestis from his stuncuffs. BD-1 then accompanied Kestis to Koboh, where the droid accidentally discovered the Chamber of Duality, kicking off Kestis' quest to reach Tanalorr. On Koboh, BD-1 acquired the ability to fire Koboh matter as well as Electro darts. Kestis eventually traveled to The Archive on Jedha, where BD-1 was reunited with Cordova. However, Bode Akuna later betrayed Cordova, killing him with a blaster. Enraged, BD-1 rushed towards Akuna, but Kestis grabbed the droid, and narrowly avoided an explosion which would have likely destroyed BD-1. After Kestis' mission for Tanalorr was complete, BD-1 continued to accompany Kestis.\n\n",

        "content": "# BD-1 - Development[]\n\nThe design process for BD-1 took over two years, during which Respawn worked closely with Lucasfilm to determine his appearance, personality, and functionality. Initially, they were determined to pair Kestis with a droid, but had not settled on the nature of the character. They raised the possibility of giving BD-1 actual dialogue, though the final design instead utilized beeps to produce emotional cues. The development team researched other iconic droids in the Star Wars franchise, such as BB-8 and R2-D2. Initial designs drew inspiration from familiar objects, such as appliances. Narrative lead Aaron Contreras based BD-1 on his own dog, while other inspirations included the characters of Snoopy and Woodstock, created by Charles Schulz.\n\nIn the initial design phase, BD-1 was instead a kitbashed booster repair droid with large thrusters and welding arms, and could provide a boost to extend the player's jumps. His design was later distilled around his essential functions and the purpose he served in the game, scanning and creating a database, which resulted in his large lens eye and holoprojector. Early designs for Cal Kestis featured a backpack which was meant to be a retrofitted carrier and charging base for BD-1. Concept art for numerous designs was created by Jordan Lamarre-Wan. Some earlier concepts included features reminiscent of R2-D2, with a large central eye, while others appeared more menacing. BD-1's final design was a mix between the bipedal stance and head-to-body proportions of a bird with the loyalty and friendliness of a dog. His vacuum-formed shapes drew inspiration from electrobinoculars, while his legs are based on those of an R2 unit and his default color pattern and heat sink are similar to that of a snowspeeder.\n\nBD-1 also had to be small enough to ensure he would not be in the way during combat and exploration. In order to allow dialogue and interaction with BD-1, the developers created the droid to emote with his head and antennae. BD-1 climbing onto the player's back was pulled from Luke Skywalker carrying Yoda during his training in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. When Cameron Monaghan was performing motion capture for Cal Kestis, a physical BD-1 prop was occasionally used to track the droid's movements on Monaghan's back.\n\nBD-1 shares traits with BT-7274, the deuteragonist of Titanfall 2, another title developed by Respawn Entertainment. Both are the mechanical companions of player characters, Cal Kestis for Jedi: Fallen Order, and Jack Cooper in Titanfall 2. Their similar name schemes, BD and BT, are short for both \"Buddy Droid\" and \"Buddy Titan\" respectively.\n\n",

When the droid spotted a person or creature, a beam of light would appear and lock on to the target. When close enough, the beam would turn red, indicating the person or creature is in imminent danger of being blown up. By 9 BBY, the origins of the roller mine were shrouded in mystery. Many assumed the droid was made for blasting through rock and debris, and some claim it was created by one of the earliest priorite prospectors. At one point, the Gotarite prospector Soont Madas attempted to use roller mines to access a Jedi Meditation Chamber on Koboh. In doing so, he reprogrammed the mines such that they became hostile to any passersby.\n\n",

In the trailer, a shot shows a sign naming the bar as Bar Belloq in aurebesh; however, this shot did not make it into the final film where the establishment goes unnamed. Pablo Hidalgo gave the tapcafe's proper name for the first time in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book released alongside the film. Hidalgo created the name in reference to the Decraniated that can be seen inside, who had been known as \"Headless Gesihas\" during production. Hidalgo later clarified that Gesh's Tapcafe was the establishment seen in the film and provided explanation for the alternate names, also calling the building Cafe Belloq, on Twitter on September 23, 2023.\n\n",

In the trailer, a shot shows a sign naming the bar as Bar Belloq in aurebesh; however, this shot did not make it into the final film where the establishment goes unnamed. Pablo Hidalgo gave the tapcafe's proper name for the first time in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book released alongside the film. Hidalgo created the name in reference to the Decraniated that can be seen inside, who had been known as \"Headless Gesihas\" during production. Hidalgo later clarified that Gesh's Tapcafe was the establishment seen in the film and provided explanation for the alternate names, also calling the building Cafe Belloq, on Twitter on September 23, 2023.\n\n",

When the droid spotted a person or creature, a beam of light would appear and lock on to the target. When close enough, the beam would turn red, indicating the person or creature is in imminent danger of being blown up. By 9 BBY, the origins of the roller mine were shrouded in mystery. Many assumed the droid was made for blasting through rock and debris, and some claim it was created by one of the earliest priorite prospectors. At one point, the Gotarite prospector Soont Madas attempted to use roller mines to access a Jedi Meditation Chamber on Koboh.

In 9 ABY, he was the boss of a meat packing plant on the space station, which employed many other Klatooinians. At that time, though, Baiz came to owe credits to someone and managed to have a 9850-credit bounty placed on him. Hired by an Ishi Tib guild master, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin made his way to the plant and confronted Baiz while he and one of his workers counted New Republic credits. When the Mandalorian asked for Baiz, revealing a tracking fob for the Klatooinian, the boss pretended to be a different individual and asked what the bounty hunter wanted of him.\n\nAfter Djarin pointed out the Klatooinian's debt, Baiz falsely promised to let the Mandalorian's target know when he saw him, only for the bounty hunter to reveal a bounty puck that displayed Baiz's face and bounty. Baiz denied the face on the puck was him, but the Mandalorian then told the boss's workers in the room to leave. With his workers not moving, the Klatooinian declared Djarin was surrounded and offered him a chance to discuss alternative options. The bounty hunter, however, stated that he would bring Baiz in alive or dead.\n\nAs Djarin drew his blaster pistol, one of Baiz's workers disarmed him, and the Mandalorian fought the Baiz's workers around him, killing them all. Rising from his seat, Baiz drew his own blaster pistol and fired at the bounty hunter. However, Djarin dug a knife into Baiz's chest and threw him onto his table, cutting him in two with the Darksaber, a black lightsaber and a symbolic weapon for the Mandalorians. With another worker inspecting the room and quickly fleeing, the bounty hunter cut off Baiz's head and convinced the group of Klatooinian meat packers, who had come to confront him, to go and plunder Baiz's credits. Djarin then took the head of Baiz back to the Ishi Tib guild master, who gave him the Klatooinian's reward and some information in exchange.\n\n",

Every member of the Lost Twenty had forsaken the Order after becoming disillusioned about its principles, indeed the Order's very way of life, according to Jedi Master Yula Braylon, who served on the Jedi High Council.\n\nJedi Master Keeve Trennis left the Order in what Grand Master Yoda recalled to be a sad event.\n\nDuring the late era of the Galactic Republic, Jedi Master Dooku became disillusioned the corruption in the Galactic Senate as well as the traditions of the Jedi. In 42 BBY Dooku left the Order and return to his homeworld Serenno, where he reclaimed his title of Count and heritage as a nobleman after overthrowing his corrupt brother, Ramil. His former peers believed his decision was misguided but still held him in high esteem. However the Count of Serenno began to secretly conspire with the Sith Darth Sidious. After the death of his former Padawan Qui-Gon Jinn at the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, and following the duel in the Works which saw the death of Jedi Master Yaddle, Dooku embraced the dark side of the Force and adopted the name of Darth Tyranus upon fully becoming the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious. Publicly, he retained his former identity while serving as the face of a secessionist movement which would develop into the secession of thousands of disgruntled star systems from the Republic into the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the beginning of the three year long Clone Wars.\n\nBy 22 BBY, in the final days leading to the Clone Wars, the group was commemorated by the Jedi Order through a series of sculptural portrait heads, one for each member of the Lost Twenty. The busts were located in the Archives of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\n",

Prior to the film's release, it was revealed in the film's teaser trailer, which was posted on April 7, 2016. In the trailer, a shot shows a sign naming the bar as Bar Belloq in aurebesh; however, this shot did not make it into the final film where the establishment goes unnamed. Pablo Hidalgo gave the tapcafe's proper name for the first time in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book released alongside the film. Hidalgo created the name in reference to the Decraniated that can be seen inside, who had been known as \"Headless Gesihas\" during production. Hidalgo later clarified that Gesh's Tapcafe was the establishment seen in the film and provided explanation for the alternate names, also calling the building Cafe Belloq, on Twitter on September 23, 2023.\n\n",

In 9 ABY, he was the boss of a meat packing plant on the space station, which employed many other Klatooinians. At that time, though, Baiz came to owe credits to someone and managed to have a 9850-credit bounty placed on him. Hired by an Ishi Tib guild master, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin made his way to the plant and confronted Baiz while he and one of his workers counted New Republic credits. When the Mandalorian asked for Baiz, revealing a tracking fob for the Klatooinian, the boss pretended to be a different individual and asked what the bounty hunter wanted of him.\n\nAfter Djarin pointed out the Klatooinian's debt, Baiz falsely promised to let the Mandalorian's target know when he saw him, only for the bounty hunter to reveal a bounty puck that displayed Baiz's face and bounty. Baiz denied the face on the puck was him, but the Mandalorian then told the boss's workers in the room to leave. With his workers not moving, the Klatooinian declared Djarin was surrounded and offered him a chance to discuss alternative options. The bounty hunter, however, stated that he would bring Baiz in alive or dead.\n\nAs Djarin drew his blaster pistol, one of Baiz's workers disarmed him, and the Mandalorian fought the Baiz's workers around him, killing them all. Rising from his seat, Baiz drew his own blaster pistol and fired at the bounty hunter. However, Djarin dug a knife into Baiz's chest and threw him onto his table, cutting him in two with the Darksaber, a black lightsaber and a symbolic weapon for the Mandalorians. With another worker inspecting the room and quickly fleeing, the bounty hunter cut off Baiz's head and convinced the group of Klatooinian meat packers, who had come to confront him, to go and plunder Baiz's credits. Djarin then took the head of Baiz back to the Ishi Tib guild master, who gave him the Klatooinian's reward and some information in exchange.\n\n",

Every member of the Lost Twenty had forsaken the Order after becoming disillusioned about its principles, indeed the Order's very way of life, according to Jedi Master Yula Braylon, who served on the Jedi High Council.\n\nJedi Master Keeve Trennis left the Order in what Grand Master Yoda recalled to be a sad event.\n\nDuring the late era of the Galactic Republic, Jedi Master Dooku became disillusioned the corruption in the Galactic Senate as well as the traditions of the Jedi. In 42 BBY Dooku left the Order and return to his homeworld Serenno, where he reclaimed his title of Count and heritage as a nobleman after overthrowing his corrupt brother, Ramil. His former peers believed his decision was misguided but still held him in high esteem. However the Count of Serenno began to secretly conspire with the Sith Darth Sidious. After the death of his former Padawan Qui-Gon Jinn at the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, and following the duel in the Works which saw the death of Jedi Master Yaddle, Dooku embraced the dark side of the Force and adopted the name of Darth Tyranus upon fully becoming the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious. Publicly, he retained his former identity while serving as the face of a secessionist movement which would develop into the secession of thousands of disgruntled star systems from the Republic into the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the beginning of the three year long Clone Wars.\n\nBy 22 BBY, in the final days leading to the Clone Wars, the group was commemorated by the Jedi Order through a series of sculptural portrait heads, one for each member of the Lost Twenty. The busts were located in the Archives of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\n",

They were composed of a miniaturized, high-capacity mem-stik, equipped with an integrated power cell and a data jack. Vessel implants were typically installed at the back of a user's skull, hidden by hair or a flap of synthskin. They were highly secure, non-networked, and equipped with a stout anti-virus package. They could only be sliced into if their user was incapacitated or if the implant was removed. Users who had vessel implants installed within them were unable to know what information was stored within the implant, unless they uploaded that information themselves. Data was transferred to and from the implant with a fiber-optic cable that could connect to nearly any datapad or computer.\n\nVessel implants cost 900 credits on the market and were often used by Couriers and Sleeper Agents. Most intelligence agents who used the implant preferred not to know what was contained within them, in order to ensure that they couldn't divulge the information they carried.\n\n",

When close enough, the beam would turn red, indicating the person or creature is in imminent danger of being blown up. By 9 BBY, the origins of the roller mine were shrouded in mystery. Many assumed the droid was made for blasting through rock and debris, and some claim it was created by one of the earliest priorite prospectors.

The medallion was fashioned from diamond and originated from the planet Luzalite. It was not blaster-proof, though it was still capable of protecting its wearer from blaster fire when struck directly. Kozmo Sundrel IV wore the medallion while attending Reena University around 396 BBY; Sundrel's acquaintance, fellow student Axel Greylark, regarded it as \"ridiculous.\" Sundrel continued to wear the medallion when he was held hostage and forced to steal for the Path of the Open Hand, having hid it under the server's uniform he was forced to wear in order to prevent it from being stolen as well. When Sundrel was shot by Leyli Romero\u2014another fellow student and a spy for the Path\u2014the Luzalite diamond medallion took the blow and protected him. Afterwards, he commented that he should ask his father to make a blaster-proof prototype of the medallion.\n\n",

The medallion was fashioned from diamond and originated from the planet Luzalite. It was not blaster-proof, though it was still capable of protecting its wearer from blaster fire when struck directly. Kozmo Sundrel IV wore the medallion while attending Reena University around 396 BBY; Sundrel's acquaintance, fellow student Axel Greylark, regarded it as \"ridiculous.\" Sundrel continued to wear the medallion when he was held hostage and forced to steal for the Path of the Open Hand, having hid it under the server's uniform he was forced to wear in order to prevent it from being stolen as well. When Sundrel was shot by Leyli Romero\u2014another fellow student and a spy for the Path\u2014the Luzalite diamond medallion took the blow and protected him. Afterwards, he commented that he should ask his father to make a blaster-proof prototype of the medallion.\n\n",

In 9 ABY, he was the boss of a meat packing plant on the space station, which employed many other Klatooinians. At that time, though, Baiz came to owe credits to someone and managed to have a 9850-credit bounty placed on him. Hired by an Ishi Tib guild master, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin made his way to the plant and confronted Baiz while he and one of his workers counted New Republic credits. When the Mandalorian asked for Baiz, revealing a tracking fob for the Klatooinian, the boss pretended to be a different individual and asked what the bounty hunter wanted of him.\n\nAfter Djarin pointed out the Klatooinian's debt, Baiz falsely promised to let the Mandalorian's target know when he saw him, only for the bounty hunter to reveal a bounty puck that displayed Baiz's face and bounty. Baiz denied the face on the puck was him, but the Mandalorian then told the boss's workers in the room to leave. With his workers not moving, the Klatooinian declared Djarin was surrounded and offered him a chance to discuss alternative options. The bounty hunter, however, stated that he would bring Baiz in alive or dead.\n\nAs Djarin drew his blaster pistol, one of Baiz's workers disarmed him, and the Mandalorian fought the Baiz's workers around him, killing them all. Rising from his seat, Baiz drew his own blaster pistol and fired at the bounty hunter. However, Djarin dug a knife into Baiz's chest and threw him onto his table, cutting him in two with the Darksaber, a black lightsaber and a symbolic weapon for the Mandalorians. With another worker inspecting the room and quickly fleeing, the bounty hunter cut off Baiz's head and convinced the group of Klatooinian meat packers, who had come to confront him, to go and plunder Baiz's credits. Djarin then took the head of Baiz back to the Ishi Tib guild master, who gave him the Klatooinian's reward and some information in exchange.\n\n",

Every member of the Lost Twenty had forsaken the Order after becoming disillusioned about its principles, indeed the Order's very way of life, according to Jedi Master Yula Braylon, who served on the Jedi High Council.\n\nJedi Master Keeve Trennis left the Order in what Grand Master Yoda recalled to be a sad event.\n\nDuring the late era of the Galactic Republic, Jedi Master Dooku became disillusioned the corruption in the Galactic Senate as well as the traditions of the Jedi. In 42 BBY Dooku left the Order and return to his homeworld Serenno, where he reclaimed his title of Count and heritage as a nobleman after overthrowing his corrupt brother, Ramil. His former peers believed his decision was misguided but still held him in high esteem. However the Count of Serenno began to secretly conspire with the Sith Darth Sidious. After the death of his former Padawan Qui-Gon Jinn at the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, and following the duel in the Works which saw the death of Jedi Master Yaddle, Dooku embraced the dark side of the Force and adopted the name of Darth Tyranus upon fully becoming the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious. Publicly, he retained his former identity while serving as the face of a secessionist movement which would develop into the secession of thousands of disgruntled star systems from the Republic into the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the beginning of the three year long Clone Wars.\n\nBy 22 BBY, in the final days leading to the Clone Wars, the group was commemorated by the Jedi Order through a series of sculptural portrait heads, one for each member of the Lost Twenty. The busts were located in the Archives of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\n",

At some point during the Republic Era, Reckly decided to join the Opposition, a political performance troupe of Pijali natives led by Halin Azucca. For some time, the group hosted theatrical performances on Pijal that showcased its opinions on local issues while also being informative to the public. By 40 BBY, the Opposition began to protest the Governance Treaty, believing that the motion would cede irrevocable power to the Czerka Corporation, which had been exploiting the resources of Pijal and its moon for centuries.\n\nThat year, shortly after initiating several pranks to express their dissent of the treaty, members of the Opposition, including Reckly, were framed by the Pijali monarchy for several violent attacks on Czerka facilities. Due to the framing, the troupe members were forced into hiding on Pijal's moon, where they gathered evidence that the attacks blamed on the Opposition had been carried out by blackguards, a secret division of royal guards loyal to Pijal's Princess Fanry. During their mission to Pijal to investigate the Opposition, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, were attacked by blackguards while on the planet's moon. The Jedi's escape from their assailants was aided by members of the performance troupe, including Reckly.\n\nAzucca led the Jedi and her colleagues to a nearby hideout, where she explained that the Opposition had entirely peaceful intentions. The troupe leader detailed that her organization's members had been framed for the recent attacks on Czerka facilities that had been committed by blackguards. A young Opposition member corroborated Azucca's claim to the Jedi, citing their members' innocuous former professions, including Reckly's training as a drummer. Azucca later gave Jinn a file containing evidence concerning the blackguards, which Reckly had helped collect, for use in the Jedi's investigation.\n\n",

In 34 ABY, after the Colossus refueling station was sunk into the ocean of the planet Castilon by the Resistance members Jarek Yeager and Kazuda Xiono, the First Order man informed Commander Pyre and First Order Security Bureau Agent Tierny that the station's communications blanket had gone offline as a result of its sinking. In response, Imanuel Doza\u2014the station's captain who had secretly been working with the Resistance operatives\u2014claimed that the communications blanket must have gone down as a result of water damage. Afterward, Tieny looked outside of Doza's office's window and noted that the blanket was still above sea level, prompting Pyre to leave the office with stormtroopers to investigate.\n\n",

At some point during the Republic Era, Reckly decided to join the Opposition, a political performance troupe of Pijali natives led by Halin Azucca. For some time, the group hosted theatrical performances on Pijal that showcased its opinions on local issues while also being informative to the public. By 40 BBY, the Opposition began to protest the Governance Treaty, believing that the motion would cede irrevocable power to the Czerka Corporation, which had been exploiting the resources of Pijal and its moon for centuries.\n\nThat year, shortly after initiating several pranks to express their dissent of the treaty, members of the Opposition, including Reckly, were framed by the Pijali monarchy for several violent attacks on Czerka facilities. Due to the framing, the troupe members were forced into hiding on Pijal's moon, where they gathered evidence that the attacks blamed on the Opposition had been carried out by blackguards, a secret division of royal guards loyal to Pijal's Princess Fanry. During their mission to Pijal to investigate the Opposition, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, were attacked by blackguards while on the planet's moon. The Jedi's escape from their assailants was aided by members of the performance troupe, including Reckly.\n\nAzucca led the Jedi and her colleagues to a nearby hideout, where she explained that the Opposition had entirely peaceful intentions. The troupe leader detailed that her organization's members had been framed for the recent attacks on Czerka facilities that had been committed by blackguards. A young Opposition member corroborated Azucca's claim to the Jedi, citing their members' innocuous former professions, including Reckly's training as a drummer. Azucca later gave Jinn a file containing evidence concerning the blackguards, which Reckly had helped collect, for use in the Jedi's investigation.\n\n",

She declined each time, and, upon his last attempt, asked him if she looked like the kind of person who drank the beverage; Ohnaka agreed that Netal did not. According to Resistance spy Vi Moradi, the former First Order stormtrooper Archex was another human who did not seem the type to drink the beverage.\n\nThat year, Julen Rakab and Volt Vescuso, a pair of humans, drank congratulatory Fuzzy Tauntauns at Oga's Cantina after Rakab successfully thwarted Ana Tolla's attack on Saka Homestead.

        "content": "# Light show - History[]\n\nIn about 18 BBY, Senior Captain Thrawn of the Chiss Ascendancy encountered a force of the Paataatus Hiveborn above their homeworld of Nettehi. In the ensuing skirmish, Paataatus warships aimed their spectrum lasers at the ships of Thrawn's Picket Force Six. However, the Paataatus forces' spectrum lasers were configured to deal no damage, even though spectrum lasers were designed to shift their energy frequencies to maximize damage to whatever material they were targeted on. This led Thrawn to discover the Paataatus were subjugated to remnants of the Nikardun Destiny's military. Thrawn's first officer Mid Captain Ufsa'mak'ro remarked that the Paataatus were putting on a \"light show\" rather than attacking the Chiss. The Prince Militaire of the Hiveborn was in fact covertly requesting Thrawn's help to free his people from the Nikardun. In the ensuing skirmish above Nettehi, Thrawn targeted Nikardun blockade frigates effectively holding Nettehi hostage, and the Paataatus leader thanked Thrawn for his assistance.\n\nThe Watith Captain Fsir later used the tactic by having his own remotely-piloted gunboats attack his freighter during a skirmish meant to lead Thrawn to believe they were under attack by Vagaari pirates. Thrawn captured and appropriated the Watith gunboats and the Saltbarrel, which he would in turn use for a light show of his own. At the Hoxim incident, Thrawn sought to foil a scheme to draw the Ascendancy into a civil war. There, Thrawn had members of three Great Families target their family fleets' warships with \"maximum ferocity but minimal actual damage\" using the remote-controlled ships he had claimed from the treacherous Watith.\n\n",

In 19 BBY, as the squad attempted to escape Imperial forces on the Mid Rim planet Bracca, they found themselves trapped in the engine of a wrecked Venator-class Star Destroyer. Needing an escape plan, the clone Wrecker suggested Plan 7. When fellow clone Echo responded by stating that Plan 7 was not relevant to their situation, Wrecker prompted Echo to suggest a different strategy. The team soon came up with a new plan, utilizing explosives Wrecker had salvaged from the cruiser's armory to detach the engine from the ship and escape from there.\n\n",

In the ensuing skirmish, Paataatus warships aimed their spectrum lasers at the ships of Thrawn's Picket Force Six. However, the Paataatus forces' spectrum lasers were configured to deal no damage, even though spectrum lasers were designed to shift their energy frequencies to maximize damage to whatever material they were targeted on. This led Thrawn to discover the Paataatus were subjugated to remnants of the Nikardun Destiny's military. Thrawn's first officer Mid Captain Ufsa'mak'ro remarked that the Paataatus were putting on a \"light show\" rather than attacking the Chiss. The Prince Militaire of the Hiveborn was in fact covertly requesting Thrawn's help to free his people from the Nikardun. In the ensuing skirmish above Nettehi, Thrawn targeted Nikardun blockade frigates effectively holding Nettehi hostage, and the Paataatus leader thanked Thrawn for his assistance.\n\nThe Watith Captain Fsir later used the tactic by having his own remotely-piloted gunboats attack his freighter during a skirmish meant to lead Thrawn to believe they were under attack by Vagaari pirates. Thrawn captured and appropriated the Watith gunboats and the Saltbarrel, which he would in turn use for a light show of his own. At the Hoxim incident, Thrawn sought to foil a scheme to draw the Ascendancy into a civil war. There, Thrawn had members of three Great Families target their family fleets' warships with \"maximum ferocity but minimal actual damage\" using the remote-controlled ships he had claimed from the treacherous Watith.\n\n",

She declined each time, and, upon his last attempt, asked him if she looked like the kind of person who drank the beverage; Ohnaka agreed that Netal did not.

The medallion was fashioned from diamond and originated from the planet Luzalite. It was not blaster-proof, though it was still capable of protecting its wearer from blaster fire when struck directly. Kozmo Sundrel IV wore the medallion while attending Reena University around 396 BBY; Sundrel's acquaintance, fellow student Axel Greylark, regarded it as \"ridiculous.\" Sundrel continued to wear the medallion when he was held hostage and forced to steal for the Path of the Open Hand, having hid it under the server's uniform he was forced to wear in order to prevent it from being stolen as well. When Sundrel was shot by Leyli Romero\u2014another fellow student and a spy for the Path\u2014the Luzalite diamond medallion took the blow and protected him. Afterwards, he commented that he should ask his father to make a blaster-proof prototype of the medallion.\n\n",

In 19 BBY, as the squad attempted to escape Imperial forces on the Mid Rim planet Bracca, they found themselves trapped in the engine of a wrecked Venator-class Star Destroyer. Needing an escape plan, the clone Wrecker suggested Plan 7. When fellow clone Echo responded by stating that Plan 7 was not relevant to their situation, Wrecker prompted Echo to suggest a different strategy. The team soon came up with a new plan, utilizing explosives Wrecker had salvaged from the cruiser's armory to detach the engine from the ship and escape from there.\n\n",

Doza agreed they can go, and Kaz also brought Synara San with the mission as well. They took an orange/white transport and they went to Vargo Spaceport.\n\nAs the crew arrived at Vargo Spaceport, Kaz asked CB-23 if she can home in on the Resistance signal. CB-23 replied to Kaz that the signal was coming from across the village. Jarek Yeager said to Kaz to keep a low profile. Kaz replied that he was a spy, and assured that he knew how to keep a low profile. Ironically, Kaz accidentally fell over a barrel that had food in it that belonged to a shop owner. As Synara walked passed Kaz, who was on the ground, she said to him to maybe keep a lower profile. The shop owner was angry, and threw a fruit at Kaz's head.\n\n",

Doza agreed they can go, and Kaz also brought Synara San with the mission as well. They took an orange/white transport and they went to Vargo Spaceport.\n\nAs the crew arrived at Vargo Spaceport, Kaz asked CB-23 if she can home in on the Resistance signal. CB-23 replied to Kaz that the signal was coming from across the village. Jarek Yeager said to Kaz to keep a low profile. Kaz replied that he was a spy, and assured that he knew how to keep a low profile. Ironically, Kaz accidentally fell over a barrel that had food in it that belonged to a shop owner. As Synara walked passed Kaz, who was on the ground, she said to him to maybe keep a lower profile. The shop owner was angry, and threw a fruit at Kaz's head.\n\n",

The bo-rifle was renowned as a weapon that could only be obtained by defeating its wielder, a custom that was known as the Boosahn Keeraw in Lasat culture.\n\nSometime between 19 BBY and 10 BBY, Masse Goskey, the proprietor of Masse Goskey's Arms Emporium and Explosives Mart in Mos Eisley spaceport on the planet Tatooine, and his associate Ephant Mon bought some weaponry on the moon of Nar Shaddaa, including a CJ-9 electrified bo-rifle that came at a price of 1,100 credits. A complete inventory of the merchandise was recorded in a book that would eventually be known as the Smuggler's Guide. According to Goskey's note in the book, all the weapons they picked up on Nar Shaddaa were illegal in sixty-six sectors, compelling them to sell the arms to crime syndicates such as the Crymorah Syndicate and the Black Sun.\n\nAt some point, a mysterious explorer compiled a journal of stories and images, including a sketch that depicted a Lasat wielding a CJ-9 bo-rifle against an aggressive creature. This sketch, along with many others that resembled the work of the Ithorian artist Gammit Chond, was later restored, expanded, and displayed by the Graf Archive on the moon Orchis 2 at some point no earlier than 34 ABY.\n\n",

The bo-rifle was renowned as a weapon that could only be obtained by defeating its wielder, a custom that was known as the Boosahn Keeraw in Lasat culture.\n\nSometime between 19 BBY and 10 BBY, Masse Goskey, the proprietor of Masse Goskey's Arms Emporium and Explosives Mart in Mos Eisley spaceport on the planet Tatooine, and his associate Ephant Mon bought some weaponry on the moon of Nar Shaddaa, including a CJ-9 electrified bo-rifle that came at a price of 1,100 credits. A complete inventory of the merchandise was recorded in a book that would eventually be known as the Smuggler's Guide. According to Goskey's note in the book, all the weapons they picked up on Nar Shaddaa were illegal in sixty-six sectors, compelling them to sell the arms to crime syndicates such as the Crymorah Syndicate and the Black Sun.\n\nAt some point, a mysterious explorer compiled a journal of stories and images, including a sketch that depicted a Lasat wielding a CJ-9 bo-rifle against an aggressive creature. This sketch, along with many others that resembled the work of the Ithorian artist Gammit Chond, was later restored, expanded, and displayed by the Graf Archive on the moon Orchis 2 at some point no earlier than 34 ABY.\n\n",

The Galactic Republic made its own mark on the Headhunter's large production run with a clone-specific model. Reaper Squadron was one unit that flew Headhunters. Decades after the end of the war, the wreckage of one of Reaper Squadron's Z-95s was recovered from Castilon's Karavian Trench by Synara San.\n\nEven after the war had ended, Z-95s were extremely common. Idryssa Barruck flew a Headhunter during her time with Saw Gerrera's Partisans, and several modified with basic hyperdrives and upgraded weaponry were used by Berch Teller's rebel cell in its fight against the Galactic Empire. Hask Taff, a member of Teller's cell, used several Headhunters to craft a false holovid that was transmitted to the Empire's Sentinel Base. The signal was meant to deceive the Imperials into believing that their Rampart Station had fallen under attack, thus inciting them to protect the station and leave Sentinel Base vulnerable. However, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the base's commander, detected that the message was a fraud and instead set a trap for the insurgents, who were immediately ambushed upon entering the system and forced to retreat into hyperspace. The rebels later used Z-95s to attack an Imperial convoy near the Gulf of Tatooine; all but one were obliterated, as Teller used the remaining Headhunter to escape to the planet Christophsis while the rest of his cell was captured and summarily executed. A gang of Pakiphantos also used Z-95s modified with proton cannons. The gang tried to capture the Millennium Falcon on Dhandu 3, but were outflown or outgunned.\n\n",

        "content": "# Z-95 Headhunter - Prolific starfighter[]\n\nJointly manufactured by Incom Corporation and Subpro, the Z-95 Headhunter entered production during the Clone Wars and spawned countless variants. The Galactic Republic made its own mark on the Headhunter's large production run with a clone-specific model. Reaper Squadron was one unit that flew Headhunters. Decades after the end of the war, the wreckage of one of Reaper Squadron's Z-95s was recovered from Castilon's Karavian Trench by Synara San.\n\nEven after the war had ended, Z-95s were extremely common. Idryssa Barruck flew a Headhunter during her time with Saw Gerrera's Partisans, and several modified with basic hyperdrives and upgraded weaponry were used by Berch Teller's rebel cell in its fight against the Galactic Empire. Hask Taff, a member of Teller's cell, used several Headhunters to craft a false holovid that was transmitted to the Empire's Sentinel Base. The signal was meant to deceive the Imperials into believing that their Rampart Station had fallen under attack, thus inciting them to protect the station and leave Sentinel Base vulnerable. However, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the base's commander, detected that the message was a fraud and instead set a trap for the insurgents, who were immediately ambushed upon entering the system and forced to retreat into hyperspace. The rebels later used Z-95s to attack an Imperial convoy near the Gulf of Tatooine; all but one were obliterated, as Teller used the remaining Headhunter to escape to the planet Christophsis while the rest of his cell was captured and summarily executed. A gang of Pakiphantos also used Z-95s modified with proton cannons. The gang tried to capture the Millennium Falcon on Dhandu 3, but were outflown or outgunned.\n\n",

They were dazzling flowers whose blooming was triggered by the presence of other life-forms. They had special follicles on their stems that were highly sensitive, enabling them to detect breath or heat and would blossom for anyone that took the time to observe them.\n\nEzra Bridger enjoyed watching these flowers and was refreshed by the mere sight of watching the spread of their petals from the flowers' emerald center, no matter how bad his day had been.\n\n",

        "content": "# Z-95 Headhunter - Venerable snub-fighter[]\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic continued to use Z-95s. Despite being slightly slower and less maneuverable than its successors, including the T-65B, the Z-95 proved a close-air-support staple of the Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps. The TIE fighter pilots of the Imperial Navy referred to Z-95s as \"skulls.\" During a battle on Portocari, Rebel Headhunters killed an Imperial pilot named Barsay.\n\nThough they had long been retired from military use, Z-95s were a favorite among smugglers, gangsters, pirates, and a variety of others seeking to do both legitimate and illegitimate business twenty-nine years after the end of the Galactic Civil War. In one instance, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron acquired three Z-95s for a covert mission designated Operation: Sabre Strike.\n\nPilots with the Citizens' Fleet flew Z-95s during the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY.\n\n",

        "content": "# Z-95 Headhunter - Behind the scenes[]\n\nThe Z-95 Headhunter made its first appearance in the new Star Wars canon in the mobile game Star Wars: Commander, published by Disney Interactive on August 21, 2014. Before that, it was referenced in the clone Z-95 starfighter entry in the now-discontinued StarWars.com Encyclopedia. This entry, including the Z-95's mention, has since transferred over to the Encyclopedia's current replacement, the Databank. The Z-95 Headhunter was originally created for the 1979 Star Wars Legends novel Han Solo at Stars' End, written by Brian Daley as the first entry in The Han Solo Adventures trilogy.\n\nWhile Poe Dameron: Flight Log says the length of the Z-95 is 16.74 meters, Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon 59 says the ship is only 11.8 meters long. This article assumes the former is correct.\n\n",

Named after the Coromon Headhunter, the Z-95 was equipped with two pairs of engines, the Z-95 was originally manufactured without a hyperdrive, though it could be retrofitted with a rudimentary one. However, as it lacked an astromech socket, its pilot was forced to pre-program hyperspace routes or force-feed its navicomputer jump coordinates provided by data chips. The Z-95 was also noted for its cramped one-man cockpit.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, the Z-95 featured internal environmental controls and a pair of wingtip-mounted, high-powered blaster cannons. It also boasted concussion missile launchers and a center-mounted ion cannon, which was capable of penetrating deflector shields. The Z-95 was the forerunner of Incom's incredibly successful T-65B X-wing starfighter, which implemented technologies and designs tested in the Z-95. Another successor to the Headhunter was the Z-96, introduced after the Clone Wars.\n\n",
