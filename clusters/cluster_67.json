Four months after the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, the cantina was crawling with refugees of the battle, former members of the fallen Galactic Empire as well as pirates, explorers and fortune seekers. Nath Tensent, an ex-pilot of the New Republic, tracked down the ex-Imperial TIE fighter pilot Bansu Ro to Freerock and approached him at an alcove in the Rim's Edge, offering the man a place in his freelancing crew.\n\nThe cantina's signature drink, a Rim's Edge, was recorded in Strono \"Cookie\" Tuggs' Ultimate Cookbook.\n\n",

Located in the city center of the city of Jibuto, the Wanton Wellspring was a hole-in-the-wall location. The Dressellian Has Obitt found the Wanton Wellspring was not a very unique location, thinking it was no more inspiring than the Contented Krayt on Tatooine, or no more nastier than the Malicious Moondog on Suba.\n\nThey served strong drinks, featured live music, including a Twi'lek band, and Obitt considered its wait staff to be attractive, particularly the Dressellian Woana. Gamorrean bouncers would work the door. The bartender was a four-armed humanoid. As a haven and headquarters for smugglers and rogues of all kinds, the Wanton Wellspring had a back room reserved for private groups that also served as a hidden area to stash illegal substances if the authorities inspected the premises. With many underground activities occurring there, the patrons of the Wellspring were a discreet bunch. The room could fit over a dozen people and had a ten-year-old holoprojector that could display maps and even entertainment holos.\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, stormtroopers would respond to incidents at the cantina and detain any troublemakers. Local police previously did not interfere with many of the activities at the cantina, and the Imperial garrison nearby meant more secrecy was required. The Empire's presence disrupted the relationship between the cantina and local police, would warn the owners of the Wanton Wellspring about raids.\n\n",

This was used for those who had consumed too much starfire 'skee, wanted to leave with a new friend or were ushered out by Surat Nuat's enforcers. The crime lord used the side door for this to avoid intimidating anyone from coming in and spending their credits there. Nuat always ensured the door was guarded and kept locked.\n\nUpon locating the cantina for the first time, former Imperial Loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus surmised the venue was probably also a slaver market and black market compound.\n\n",

When the customers accused Maul of being a Jedi, Maul angrily engaged them in a bar fight.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker made a visit to the bar seeking safe passage to Coruscant. The bartender ignored his request and told his customers to kill him. However, Skywalker managed to defend himself with his lightsaber. The weapon piqued the Zabrak bartender's interest, and he decided to offer passage to Coruscant in exchange for the lightsaber. Skywalker declined his offer, prompting the bartender to once again order his customers to kill him and to also retrieve the lightsaber. Before they could, however, a thief inside the bar who worked for Grakkus the Hutt stole the lightsaber and escaped the establishment.\n\nResponding to R2-D2's distress call, C-3PO and Chewbacca visited the bar, seeking information on Skywalker's whereabouts. The Zabrak bartender was uncooperative, telling the two that he did not welcome droids and Wookiees. C-3PO then challenged the bar patrons to a fight with Chewbacca. The Wookiee bested the bartender and his patrons, smashing at least one window in the process. The bartender then revealed that Skywalker had been captured by Grakkus the Hutt.\n\n",

When a Chagrian patron began vying for Selbie's attention, Averross gleefully brandished his lightsaber and embarrassed the customer until he left. Afterward, Averross saw a nearby holoscreen displaying the burning of a Czerka warehouse. He quickly left the establishment, believing that the incident was caused by the Opposition performance troupe.\n\nThe cantina was carved out of a dingy rock and had a muddy appearance. Due to this, some felt the establishment's smell was similar to that of the cantina's Wookiee bartender.

During a culinary tour of the galaxy that he took between 34 ABY and 35 ABY, the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs intended to visit the Skakoan homeworld Skako to try their food, but abandoned that plan upon learning that he would need an atmospheric suit to survive the high-pressure methane atmosphere. Instead, he ordered the Skako Cooler from the cantina on Brentaal IV and mentioned the establishment as part of the recipe for the drink that he included in his third cookbook, The Ultimate Cookbook, which was published in 35 ABY.\n\n",

While at the establishment, one of the crew's members\u2014the Trandoshan Bossk\u2014got into a fight with Houk patrons. At the same time, T'onga, another member of the crew, went to a bar to get a round of drinks for the group. She, however, became distracted by Tarkon and ignored two other bartenders' attempts to serve her. This resulted in it taking a long amount of time to acquire the drinks that her twin brother T'ongor went to see what had taken her so long, as he was in need of a Dark Blue Milk before Bossk got the crew kicked out of the cantina for fighting. When he realized the reason for the delay, T'ongor told his sister that he would have to get his own drink and returned to the crew's booth.\n\nAfter T'ongor arrived back at the booth, Bossk, who had since stopped fighting with the Houks, attempted to bait the cyborg Beilert Valance into fighting him, though it failed as Lash held back the cyborg and told him to settle down. Immediately after, T'onga arrived at the booth, and the Nautolan began talking to the crew, telling them she saw them as her family. Lash then asked the crew to promise her that they would look out for each other after she had died so that even at their lowest points or in their worst moments, they would not be alone. With this, the Nautolan raised her drink in a toast, and T'onga clinked her beverage with Valance.\n\nBetween 3 ABY and 4 ABY, after returning to their home on the Moon of Logal Ri, T'onga informed Tarkon\u2014now her wife\u2014of her plans to open a cantina on the moon, and reminded Tarkon of the cantina she had owned. The two, along with their business partner Cadeliah then discussed ideas for what the cantina would have.\n\n",

Two sets of sliding doors allowed customers entrance to 79's, above which the bar boasted a large, brightly lit sign displaying the establishment's name. Inside, an assortment of tables and booths were arranged for patrons to sit at across two floors. In the center of the first floor, a long, oval bar was tended by several 2-1B surgical droid droid servers, led by BU-11. They offered various drinks, served by several BD-3000 luxury droids as waitresses. 79's maintained a number of viewscreens broadcasting sporting events from around the galaxy, including podracing, and the bar played energetic dance music for its patrons.

Afterward, Averross saw a nearby holoscreen displaying the burning of a Czerka warehouse. He quickly left the establishment, believing that the incident was caused by the Opposition performance troupe.\n\nThe cantina was carved out of a dingy rock and had a muddy appearance.

Located in the city center of the city of Jibuto, the Wanton Wellspring was a hole-in-the-wall location. The Dressellian Has Obitt found the Wanton Wellspring was not a very unique location, thinking it was no more inspiring than the Contented Krayt on Tatooine, or no more nastier than the Malicious Moondog on Suba.\n\nThey served strong drinks, featured live music, including a Twi'lek band, and Obitt considered its wait staff to be attractive, particularly the Dressellian Woana. Gamorrean bouncers would work the door. The bartender was a four-armed humanoid. As a haven and headquarters for smugglers and rogues of all kinds, the Wanton Wellspring had a back room reserved for private groups that also served as a hidden area to stash illegal substances if the authorities inspected the premises. With many underground activities occurring there, the patrons of the Wellspring were a discreet bunch. The room could fit over a dozen people and had a ten-year-old holoprojector that could display maps and even entertainment holos.\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, stormtroopers would respond to incidents at the cantina and detain any troublemakers. Local police previously did not interfere with many of the activities at the cantina, and the Imperial garrison nearby meant more secrecy was required. The Empire's presence disrupted the relationship between the cantina and local police, would warn the owners of the Wanton Wellspring about raids.\n\n",

At least two stories in height, 79's was nestled in one of Coruscant's enormous skyscrapers; the bar's main entrance was positioned at one of the building's corners, trimmed by wide walkways and supporting curbside traffic from speeders and air taxis. Two sets of sliding doors allowed customers entrance to 79's, above which the bar boasted a large, brightly lit sign displaying the establishment's name. Inside, an assortment of tables and booths were arranged for patrons to sit at across two floors. In the center of the first floor, a long, oval bar was tended by several 2-1B surgical droid droid servers, led by BU-11. They offered various drinks, served by several BD-3000 luxury droids as waitresses. 79's maintained a number of viewscreens broadcasting sporting events from around the galaxy, including podracing, and the bar played energetic dance music for its patrons. At the back of 79's main room, on the first floor, was as a latrine for customer use.\n\n",

The bar only served a select few drinks including ale, grog and Starfire 'skee.\n\nThe Alcazar was also a gambling house that played host to games such as pazaak, Kessel Wheel and rolling sheg-knuckles and provided other services for those who preferred to play games such as the One-Armed Smuggler.\n\nAside from the main entrance, the cantina also had a side door which the locals named the 'shame door'. This was used for those who had consumed too much starfire 'skee, wanted to leave with a new friend or were ushered out by Surat Nuat's enforcers. The crime lord used the side door for this to avoid intimidating anyone from coming in and spending their credits there. Nuat always ensured the door was guarded and kept locked.\n\nUpon locating the cantina for the first time, former Imperial Loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus surmised the venue was probably also a slaver market and black market compound.\n\n",

When the customers accused Maul of being a Jedi, Maul angrily engaged them in a bar fight.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker made a visit to the bar seeking safe passage to Coruscant. The bartender ignored his request and told his customers to kill him. However, Skywalker managed to defend himself with his lightsaber. The weapon piqued the Zabrak bartender's interest, and he decided to offer passage to Coruscant in exchange for the lightsaber. Skywalker declined his offer, prompting the bartender to once again order his customers to kill him and to also retrieve the lightsaber. Before they could, however, a thief inside the bar who worked for Grakkus the Hutt stole the lightsaber and escaped the establishment.\n\nResponding to R2-D2's distress call, C-3PO and Chewbacca visited the bar, seeking information on Skywalker's whereabouts. The Zabrak bartender was uncooperative, telling the two that he did not welcome droids and Wookiees. C-3PO then challenged the bar patrons to a fight with Chewbacca. The Wookiee bested the bartender and his patrons, smashing at least one window in the process. The bartender then revealed that Skywalker had been captured by Grakkus the Hutt.\n\n",

Jool enforced a strict no-fighting rule within, and had a cybernetic eye, with which she could monitor the goings on throughout. The bartender was Finn, a no-nonsense being who would not hesitate to use deadly force to enforce the house rules. A common fixture at Rik's was the gambler Naxy Screeger.\n\nHoloscreens transmitting podracing and live dancers entertained the clientele.\n\nIn 137 ABY, Cade stopped by the bar before his attempt to infiltrate the Temple of the Sith and leave Jool instructions in case he did not return: to hand over the access codes to the Mynock to Jariah and Deliah. Also expected Deliah and Jariah were Chak and Kee, who had rented their ship, the Grinning Liar to them. After seeing Cade, they hoped to intimidate him into revealing his crew's whereabouts, but failed.\n\nThe Nautolan Jak passed Cade as he entered the bar. He was the club's bouncer.\n\n",

While at the establishment, one of the crew's members\u2014the Trandoshan Bossk\u2014got into a fight with Houk patrons. At the same time, T'onga, another member of the crew, went to a bar to get a round of drinks for the group. She, however, became distracted by Tarkon and ignored two other bartenders' attempts to serve her. This resulted in it taking a long amount of time to acquire the drinks that her twin brother T'ongor went to see what had taken her so long, as he was in need of a Dark Blue Milk before Bossk got the crew kicked out of the cantina for fighting. When he realized the reason for the delay, T'ongor told his sister that he would have to get his own drink and returned to the crew's booth.\n\nAfter T'ongor arrived back at the booth, Bossk, who had since stopped fighting with the Houks, attempted to bait the cyborg Beilert Valance into fighting him, though it failed as Lash held back the cyborg and told him to settle down. Immediately after, T'onga arrived at the booth, and the Nautolan began talking to the crew, telling them she saw them as her family. Lash then asked the crew to promise her that they would look out for each other after she had died so that even at their lowest points or in their worst moments, they would not be alone. With this, the Nautolan raised her drink in a toast, and T'onga clinked her beverage with Valance.\n\nBetween 3 ABY and 4 ABY, after returning to their home on the Moon of Logal Ri, T'onga informed Tarkon\u2014now her wife\u2014of her plans to open a cantina on the moon, and reminded Tarkon of the cantina she had owned. The two, along with their business partner Cadeliah then discussed ideas for what the cantina would have.\n\n",

An old and worn establishment, the cantina's black-colored doors were the only parts of the building's exterior that appeared well-maintained by the time of the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Inside, tables and chairs were spread about for patrons to sit at, and both food and drink could be ordered from the cantina's long bar. As Enceri was a small town, the cantina's patrons were largely well-acquainted regulars. The cantina was staffed by an elderly female bartender, and served mugs of black ne'tra gal ale, in addition to bowls of soup\u2014either gi dumpling, or red gourd.\n\nIn the year 19 BBY, the Mandalorian couple Parja Bralor and Fi Skirata traveled to Enceri as part of the latter's rehabilitation from a head injury. After Bralor helped the wounded former clone commando navigate Enceri's streets, the two stopped in at the cantina for a meal and drinks. Skirata's attempts at ordering from the bar in Basic earned him odd looks from the elderly bartender\u2014Enceri residents primarily spoke the Mandalorian language, Mando'a\u2014until the older woman saw the sigils denoting disability on Skirata's Mandalorian armor, after which she spoke to him in a gentler and more helpful tone. Skirata ordered two mugs of ne'tra gal and two bowls of red gourd soup for Bralor and himself, and they enjoyed a table together in a corner of the cantina. Their time together was interrupted, however, by the arrival of fellow Mandalorian Fenn Shysa, who introduced himself to Skirata and attempted to enlist him in acting as Mand'alor in the interim until one could be truly chosen, a proposition he would later elaborate upon at a second meeting in the Oyu'baat tapcaf in Keldabe.\n\n",

The viewports had been covered up by large metal sheets bolted around their edges, except two of them, which were still usable. There were just a few visitors left, so there was no need for more. A few tables littered the floor of the Lounge, and a bar was situated along another section of bulkhead.\n\nThe service was not as good as in other cantinas, and Gulek Lohn demanded many credits for the tasteless meals and watered-down drinks he served. Because Stormview Lounge was the only cantina in the station, however, spacers had no chance to get their meals elsewhere. Lohn knew about that, so the Rodian made full use of it.\n\n",

The cantina was designed to appear rustic, and evoke an archaic sense of the working-class past. The alleyway entrance to the Haunch of Nerf was constructed in a mock-ancient style, reminiscent of a baronial fort. The interior of the restaurant was hot, intentionally rough-hewn, and full of inaccurately designed replicas of antique rural feasting trestles. Food at the Haunch of Nerf was served on pleekwood trenchers instead of more contemporary porceplast plates, and the cantina's ale was brewed specially to retain a cloudy appearance full of unidentifiable lumps, thought to be authentic to the ancient aesthetic the Haunch of Nerf aspired to. The Haunch of Nerf typically attracted upper class clientele, and offered private tables away from the main salon.\n\nIn the year 19 BBY, the Coruscant University professor of biology, Reye Nenilin, met with the Mandalorian soldier Kal Skirata at the Haunch of Nerf. The two shared a private table with Skirata's colleagues, Mandalorian doctor Mij Gilamar and the undercover Null-class ARC trooper Mereel, while discussing genetics research. Skirata attempted to covertly enlist Nenilin's aid in halting the accelerating aging that afflicted the Republic army's clone troopers, eventually convincing the professor to look over the data he had gathered. Skirata thought little of the Haunch of Nerf's false sense of archaism and the patrons' inaccurate, romanticized ideals of how the working-class common man lived in the past. While he was leaving the cantina, he scoffed at the Haunch of Nerf's mock-ancient exterior, musing that it was likely little more than a year old despite its historical design.\n\n",

The cantina's bartender, who also managed the establishment, was the Rodian Mika Dorin; he had taken over from the bar's previous owner, who had run afoul of Czerka Corporation over the establishment's operations. Along with spacers and freighter crews who ferried Sith artifacts from the surface, many of the instructors from the nearby Sith Academy would stop by the establishment. Yuthura Ban was the most common face present, often staying there when visiting the colony. While there, she gave final approval to Sith hopefuls who had been given medallions, which signified their worthiness to attend the Academy. When the former Dark Lord of the Sith Revan, who had been mindwiped and retrained by the Jedi Council, came to Korriban in 3956 BBY, he met with Ban at the cantina, gaining her sponsorship to attend the Academy. The cantina was also home to Mika's under-the-table business that sold \"premium items,\" such as prototype Verpine shields and life support packs to special customers.\n\n",

Though it is referred to as the \"Dreshdae Cantina\" in dialogue, reading the sign next to the entrance shows the name, which is a play on the phrase \"The Dark Side.\"\n\nThe player, as Revan, has a number of options dealing with the cantina. However, most of them are unrelated to the player's chosen alignment. With the exception of meeting Yuthura Ban, all other interactions that relate to The Drunk Side are completely optional. However, they do point toward the ultimate quest that has to do with that planet, which is finding the Star Map hidden in the tomb of Naga Sadow. While interacting with Yuthura, the player can choose to lie about their intentions if playing the canonical light side storyline or, if following the dark path, can express an honest desire to join the Sith. If the player has Juhani with them when entering the Valley of the Dark Lords and talks with Dak Vesser, he will flee back to The Drunk Side, intending to run away from the Sith after being discovered. The player has the option to follow him back to the cantina, and either let him go or attempt to kill him; if Juhani is in the party, however, she will prevent the latter choice from occurring.\n\nIn addition, the \"premium items\" quest is not always available, due to how the quest is spawned in the wake of the escape from the Leviathan. It is not certain what triggers the appearance of Ziagrom, who gives the player the option of buying the items from Dorin at the cantina.\n\n",

During the Jedi Civil War, hopefuls from around the galaxy gathered there, hoping to demonstrate to any passing Sith that they were worthy to attend the Korriban Sith Academy that had been established by Darth Revan's Sith Empire. Many of these hopefuls were largely ignored, though some were subjected to violent ends by the Academy's student body. At the same time, many freighter crews, contracted with the shipping of Sith artifacts off-world from the excavations within the Valley of the Dark Lords, where many ancient Sith Lords were buried, loitered at the cantina in between jobs. When the establishment's first owner nearly ruined the cantina financially, earning the ire of Czerka Corporation, the Rodian bartender, Mika Dorin, took over the bar's operations. He also began a side business selling \"premium\" arms and equipment to owners of the Dynamic-class freighter Ebon Hawk.\n\nWhen the mind-wiped and retrained Jedi Revan, accompanied by his comrades aboard the Hawk, arrived on Korriban in 3956 BBY, he visited the cantina, seeking clues to the location of that planet's Star Map. This ancient piece of Rakatan technology provided data that, combined with information from other Maps, provided the location of the Star Forge, the hidden weapons factory that was the pinnacle of the Infinite Empire and the power behind the Sith war effort. While asking various patrons about the artifact, Revan found that his vessel was the subject of admiration among the pilots and crew that frequented the place. Included among them was the bartender Dorin, who, along with a pair of Human pilots, treated Revan to a brief and admiring history of the Hawk and the \"services\" it had performed in the past. This included describing the ship's true purpose, smuggling, and information about those who had owned the vessel previously. Some time later, after securing a Sith Medallion from a student he had killed in order to defend a woman that the Sith had been threatening, Revan returned to the cantina to present the icon to the Twi'lek instructor Yuthura Ban. Ban, who was apprenticed to the Sith Master Uthar Wynn, was considered second-in-command at the Academy, and was intrigued by Revan's power in the Force. She voiced her suspicions that there was more to Revan than he claimed. Revan, however, managed to persuade her that he wished to join the Sith, as getting into the Academy was the only way to reach the Valley and the Map that he suspected was to be found there.\n\nAfter being accepted into the Academy, Revan and one of his companions, the Cathar Padawan Juhani, met a Sith archaeologist named Dak Vesser in the Valley of the Dark Lords. Not wanting to have anything to do with either of them or whatever had brought them to Korriban, Vesser took refuge in the cantina prior to departing the planet, but not before telling Revan about the tombs in the Valley and speaking with Juhani about their past as fellow Jedi trainees. When the Academy fell into chaos following the death of the headmaster, Wynn, and the redemption of Ban to the light side following Revan's double-cross and betrayal within the tomb of Naga Sadow, the cantina continued to do business. Eventually, Dorin, with the assistance of his partner Ziagrom, learned of Revan's true identity as the former Dark Lord of the Sith, and offered him access to the premium items they sold, including thermal detonators, life support packs, prototype personal shields, and advanced armor suits. Prior to setting out for Lehon and the Star Forge, Revan again returned to the cantina to partake in this continuation of the under-the-table business that the pair had traditionally carried out with prior owners of the Ebon Hawk.\n\nBy 3951 BBY, Korriban was largely abandoned. When Meetra Surik arrived on the ancient Sith world sometime that year, she found the Academy deserted and access to Dreshdae blocked, forcing Atton Rand, serving as pilot, to land the Hawk in the Valley of the Dark Lords itself. Infighting among the Sith in the years following the Jedi Civil War had rendered the planet virtually uninhabited.\n\n",

Later, a Beast Rider named Bakkel attacked the Exile when she asked for one of her holodiscs, to give to Ghent. Later, with the help of Ghent, the Exile arranged a meeting with Jedi Master Kavar, but during the meeting Colonel Tobin tried to capture them.

During her time on the moon in 3951 BBY, the Jedi Exile was lured here by Visquis in his attempt to claim the Exchange's outstanding bounty on Jedi. She survived the hostile environment using the Force, harnessing the power of breath control in order to conserve oxygen and to prevent the gases from being inhaled. When Visquis saw that the gas had no effect on her, he commanded the bounty hunters and other bar patrons within to attack her, offering a huge reward to whoever took her down. She was attacked by a Devaronian bartender and a Twi'lek majordomo, among others, before eventually reaching Visquis's private room. During the battle, she convinced the Lunar Shadow captain to go back to his crew before continuing her pursuit through the tunnels below the cantina and into Visquis's lair.

        "content": "# Saludi's - Description[]\n\nSaludi's was a small cantina that operated on the planet Coruscant during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. The bar was built inside part of an old bunker situated in Coruscant's undercity, far from any natural light. The name of the cantina was derived from the term \"Saludi\", a word from a dialect of the language Huttese that translated into Basic as \"hidden\". Outside, the cantina had a glowing neon sign that displayed the message \"SALUDI's - FAVORITE OF PILOTS ACROSS THE GALAXY\" and flashed on a color cycle from red to green, to blue to violet before repeating.\n\nA typical spacer bar, Saludi's was abuzz with a riot of sounds and fragrances, giving it a raucous but not unpleasant atmosphere. The cantina's interior was decorated with the same vibrant color scheme as the neon sign outside and a haze of thin smoke hung in the air. This was produced by the Alderaanian meat seasoning p'chab, which could be purchased in the bar and gave Saludi's distinctive sharp smell, different to most other cantinas. Live music from a band resonated through the bar and raised stools were located throughout for patrons to sit on, intermixed by a number of hovering stools. Alcoholic beverages could be purchased on the premises.\n\nThe cantina attracted individuals from across the breadth of the galaxy including spacers, soldiers, criminal pilots and other criminals. Its clientele included old, well-traveled spacers and young hotshot pilots, as well as military pilots from worlds such as Coruscant and Naboo, and civilian-attired pilots from the planets Alderaan and Corellia. The bar's denizens were wary of the Jedi, an order of monastic warriors allied with the Republic. Around the time of the Invasion of Naboo, the one-eyed Human Chez O'nder worked as a bartender at Saludi's and like to regale to the patrons of the bar with a tale of how he had fused his lips together by picking his teeth with a lightsaber, a weapon commonly wielded by Jedi. The Wookiee Colara worked as a bouncer at the bar and was ever diligent in her duties, always on the lookout for potential troublemakers.\n\nThe bar had a concealed backroom used for gambling, which could accessed via the cantina's restroom if one pressed a specific tile on the far-left wall that was 11 tiles across, 38 tiles down from the ceiling. Via a trapdoor beneath a table in the room was an access point to a network of tunnels that lay beneath Saludi's. The tunnels connected the bar to a nearby hidden base operated by the Believers, a Sith-worshipping cult from the Cularin system.\n\n",

It contained a jukebox and a two separate bars which were staffed by at least two Twi'leks, one of whom, named Ryn, sold jukebox tokens, and a pair of astromech droids.

By around 31 BBY, the Human Chez O'nder had became a part-owner and bartender of the cantina and he hired out the hidden Saludi's backroom to a group of spice-using Twi'lek gamblers. Unknown to O'nder, the Twi'leks received a fee from the Believers every time one of the cultists passed through the room to reach the access point to their hideout. As a result of a surge in Believer activity, the gamblers earned a profit from renting the room.\n\nOne evening, while O'nder and Colara were at work in the bar, a group of soldiers of the Mecetti House Guard, a military force from the Tapani sector, came to Saludi's to drink. Colara kept watch on the soldiers, looking for an excuse to throw them out. The playboy freighter captain Xav Verivax also ventured to the cantina and attempted to chat up some Twi'lek females. Around the same time, a group of Believers passed through the bar while returning to their secret base with a Mandalorian iron box containing a fragment of the dark side city Conkesta, which the cultists had stolen from a Coruscant landing platform.\n\nMinutes after the arrival of the Believers, a group of freelance agents arrived at Saludi's in pursuit of the stolen box, just as Colara ejected a drunken Gamorrean from the bar. The agents made enquires around the cantina as to where the Believers had gone and learned of the hidden back room. The freelancers then entered the concealed room, interrupting a game of sabacc being played by the Twi'lek gamblers, and made their way into the tunnels beneath Saludi's to confront the cultists.\n\n",

The adventure advises that the cantina should be depicted as having a similar atmosphere to the Mos Eisley Cantina, a bar that appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, but with a more alien ambience.\n\nIn the adventure, the player characters roleplay as the freelance agents who come to Saludi's while tracking the Believers and their stolen Mandalorian iron box. The agents can interact with the inhabitants of the bar while searching for information on the cultists' movements and this can play out in various different ways. It is possible for the Jedi Knight Devan For'deschel to accompany the agents to the bar, in which case the cantina's denizens eye her and any Jedi player characters warily, though do not cause any trouble unless provoked. If the player wish to speak with the bartender Chez O'nder, he is initially unavailable due to being busy serving drinks but later becomes free and it is possible for him to provide the agents with details of the secret back room. The player characters can also bribe or otherwise persuade the spacers and soldiers drinking in the bar to provide them information on the concealed gambling room.\n\nAn alternative eventuality is that the agents attempt to persuade the Wookiee bouncer Colara to provide them information, though she only speaks to them of the back room if a Wookiee among the player characters agrees to go on a date with her. It is also possible for the player characters to become involved in a confrontation with the House Mecetti soldiers relaxing in the cantina. This can erupt into a bar fight, in which case Colara intervenes to break up the brawl.\n\n",

The cantina boasted a rich arsenal of all kinds of bottles, decanters, jars, bulbs, and inhalers, with 1,241 different intoxicants. It also provided sample cuisine from every corner of the galaxy.\n\nIn 5 ABY the bar was the meeting place between the information broker 8t88 and bounty hunter Boba Fett. Expecting agent Kyle Katarn, the droid wanted Fett to help extract from him information that he wanted; Fett, however, knew of Katarn's exploits on behalf of the Rebel Alliance and knowing that the man was extremely dangerous, declined 88's offer. However, 8t88 found less competent backup, including a Gran and a second bounty hunter.\n\nIndeed, Katarn showed up soon after, according to the droid's invitation, expecting information concerning his father's death holding his Bryar pistol. 8t88 revealed Jerec's responsibility for Morgan's death during the Subjugation of Sulon, and his plans for the rebirth of the Empire. While late to the confrontation, much to 8t88's annoyance, the hirelings moved in around Katarn, leveling their blasters at him and confiscating his. The Gran warned Katarn not to move and brought up the topic of having obtained a holodisc from the home on the moon Sulon, which belonged to Katarn's father. Unable to access the disc's contents due to its encryption, 8t88 attempted to force help from Katarn, which was the actual reason for luring him there. Katarn refused, and 8t88 departed, leaving his hirelings behind to kill Katarn.\n\nInstead of immediately shooting Katarn, the Gran took the vacated seat across the table from him and asked the Rebel agent if he remembered him from their past encounter, giving Katarn the opportunity, in one swift move, to deftly throw the other thug over his shoulder, arm himself again and slide out from the table. The Gran retrieved his E-11 blaster rifle and quickly exited the room, but Katarn followed him to the main bar area and shot him, as did a second Gran near the bar. Timmy demanded that he leave, and Katarn ran after 8t88 and the stolen holodisc.\n\n",

        "content": "# Upper City Cantina - The Jedi Civil War[]\n\nThe establishment itself, however, was largely unaffected by the conflict, as it continued to serve Tarisian ale and play host to gladiatorial competitions. In 3956 BBY, during the height of the Jedi Civil War, the Sith Empire under Darth Malak conquered the planet in preparation for an ambush on a small fleet supporting a Republic warship, the Endar Spire; the battle was intended to capture the Jedi Padawan Bastila Shan in order to use her battle meditation to ensure the success of his campaign. In the wake of the conquest, the cantina would serve as a place of entertainment for the many troops and officers of the occupation force. Unknown to Malak, however, his former friend and master, whom the Sith Lord had attempted to kill one year previously, was also aboard the ship. Bastila and the amnesiac Revan, along with Carth Onasi, were able to escape the doomed vessel; owing to their abandoning ship in different escape pods, the group became separated, with Shan ending up in the Undercity, where she was quickly captured by a swoop gang known as the Black Vulkars. Carth and Revan, meanwhile, sought refuge in an abandoned apartment not far from the cantina and their pod's crash site, where the former Sith was rendered comatose for three days. Subsequent to the failure to capture or kill Shan in the immediate battle, Malak imposed a planetwide blockade.\n\nAfter recovering, Revan and Carth visited the cantina to learn about the situation on Taris, conferring with a number of patrons, including Sarna, who invited Revan to a party elsewhere in the Upper City. While at the cantina, Revan expressed an interest in entering the dueling competition being run by Ajuur, which he did under the moniker of the \"Mysterious Stranger\" in order to raise credits to help find passage offworld. Eventually, after further exploration and involvement in other incidents, including winning the Tarisian Season Opener swoop race, the pair, now joined by Bastila, met with the Mandalorian mercenary Canderous Ordo at the cantina. Ordo, who had grown dissatisfied with working for Davik Kang, had developed a plan for breaking the Sith blockade and leaving the planet. Hoping to bring Revan, Carth and Bastila in to help carry it out, the mercenary offered them a deal: in exchange for obtaining the launch codes necessary to allow a ship to leave the planet unmolested by the Sith fleet, he would provide them with the means of escape\u2014access to Davik's flagship, the Ebon Hawk. With the codes in their possession, the team met up with Ordo at another establishment, Javyar's in the Lower City, for the next step in the plan.\n\n",

His establishment had features that were designed to relax his clientele, including soft, dirge-like music, and programmed light shows across the walls. Claiming to cater to a wide range of alien physiology, C'airam's menu boasted a number of intoxicants, including exotic liqueurs. The kitchen was staffed by service droids, and could produce enough food for a large banquet, which C'airam usually reserved for distinguished guests. To prevent violent confrontations and destruction of the decor, C'airam housed a number of ergovores in the entrance and kept them underfed just enough so that they would detect the presence of blaster power packs. The power packs would then be relinquished to the proprietor upon entry to the cantina.\n\nZuckuss and 4-LOM visited this cantina while tracking Drawmas Sma'Da, a gambler who was wanted by the Galactic Empire for his seemingly-impossible luck with odds and betting in his self-developed galaxy-wide gambling operation, the Invisible & Ineluctable Casino. When Sma'Da arrived, C'airam greeted him with a banquet that had been prepared prior. After a short while, the bounty hunters made their move, with Zuckuss apprehending Sma'Da. He and 4-LOM then removed the gambler from the establishment. C'airam declared them both to be banned from his cantina, though Zuckuss claimed not to care, as \"the drinks were terrible, anyway.\"\n\n",

        "content": "# Junix's Joint - History[]\n\nThe Anchorhead Cantina was the social and dining establishment of the city of Anchorhead on Tatooine during the Jedi Civil War. Around 3956 BBY the cantina was operated by Junix Nard, who was also the bartender. He employed two Jawa servers, and the establishment featured two Bith musicians and a Twi'lek dancer, as well as a Bith hologram. Nard also ran a small store, but had limited selection as Czerka only worried about keeping their own stores full.\n\nJedi Knights Revan and Bastila Shan stopped by the cantina in 3956 BBY during their search for the Tatooine Star Map. There Bastila encountered her mother, Helena, whom she had not seen in many years. Also in the cantina at the time was a swoop racing veteran named Gandroff, a pazaak player named Furko Nellis, and two Czerka officers, as well as a handful of other patrons.\n\nIt seemed that the bar was a place favored by Czerka officers to relax and worry about their job issues when not working at the Czerka office. Several local people were worrying about issues with the war at the time Revan visited, fearing that if Darth Malak would demolish Taris-a valuable world with billions of people- to defeat the Republic, what grim fate would come to Tatooine if he arrived. However, their fears were unfounded as the Sith Lord was infinitely more concerned with capturing Bastila Shan and conquering the Core Worlds than seizing a remote planet with nothing to offer but sand, savage natives and worthless ore.\n\nIn the early days of the Galactic Empire, the cantina, by this point known as Junix's Joint, was staffed by a Duros bartender and his wife, Yoona. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi stopped at the cantina with the infant Luke Skywalker to ask for directions to the Lars homestead in 19 BBY, in the process becoming involved in a skirmish involving several of Jabba the Hutts thugs.\n\n",

As a visitor entered the establishment, they were met by a collection of pazaak tables where local players would engage in the popular card game. In addition to its prominent bar area, the common area featured an array of tables for guests to sit at; this room also served as a central hub for the rest of the establishment's various rooms.\n\nThe room immediately to the left of the entrance and the area dedicated to pazaak was used by Ajuur the Hutt to organize sanctioned duels between amateur or professional combatants who typically competed for a share of the winnings earned by Ajuur through gambling. The duelists who frequented the cantina included Gerlon Two-Fingers, Marl, Ice, Deadeye Duncan, and the champions Twitch and Bendak Starkiller. When not engaged in organized competition, the combatants would often congregate in this area; some would converse with various patrons. In addition, several viewscreens were set up for spectators who were unable to secure tickets to the duels themselves but still wanted to watch the fights. The duel ring itself was circular, with only one entrance; it was surrounded on all sides by stands that could hold a number of spectators. The ring itself was equipped with energy suppressors, so that despite the unrestricted choice of weapons offered the combatants, the chances of being killed in the typical match were very small.\n\nThe room of the cantina to the right of the entryway, which was a relatively new addition, contained a bandstand and biological or holographic dancers, which were usually in the form of female Twi'leks. An assortment of tables filled the rest of the room, providing seating for patrons to watch the performers. The final room, which was located directly opposite the entrance into the main area, was laid out as a more private place in which to enjoy drinks and meals. Tarisian nobles would often congregate there, served by wait staff.\n\n",

During the Sith Empire's occupation of that world at the height of the Jedi Civil War, many off-duty Sith troopers and officers from the nearby Tarisian Military Base frequently visited the establishment along with its regular customers and offworlders trapped on the planet because of the quarantine, which was aimed at preventing the escape of Bastila Shan. While in search of a way to rescue the missing Jedi, Galactic Republic officer Carth Onasi and the amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith Revan visited the cantina in hopes of gathering information on Taris. The establishment, along with much of the surface of Taris, was destroyed as a result of the orbital bombardment of the planet that had been ordered by Darth Malak.\n\n",

The player character has a number of alternatives when it comes to the Upper City Cantina. He or she can choose to participate in an illegal death match against Bendak Starkiller for dark-side points, or choose to ignore the dueling ring entirely; despite this, the introductory duel cinematic between Gerlon Two-Fingers and Deadeye Duncan will automatically run when the player enters the duel room. In addition, depending on the gender of the player character, they can be invited to a party, where they can gain a set of Sith armor without resorting to force, by either Sarna if the player is male, or Yun Genda if the player is female; this too is optional.\n\nIn cut content, it was possible for Deadeye Duncan to have survived the destruction of Taris; during an interactive cutscene between him and the player on Manaan, he will ask to use the Mysterious Stranger alias. The player was to have the option of questioning him on how he escaped the bombardment, during which Duncan admits that he found an automated transport whose intended passengers had been killed by fallen debris.\n\n",

Situated five kilometers south of a large public spaceport, the cantina was built with masonry construction, and possessed multiple doors. Over the bar's entrance was a sign that read \"Welcome to the Paradise Cantina,\" followed by a warning that no helmets were allowed inside. By the time of the Second Galactic Civil War, the Paradise Cantina's outer facade had fallen into a state of scarred disrepair: blasterfire had left burnt blisters in the paint on the doors, the walls were pocked from the impact of multiple ballistic rounds, and an amount of blood had been left to pool and dry near the entrance.\n\nThe inside of the cantina featured tile flooring, and accommodations for patrons to sit while enjoying their drinks. The air smelled of stale ale, vomit, and oil. The Paradise Cantina possessed a long countertop bar, attended to by a barkeep, with shelves stocked with liquor and stacked glasses located behind it. Complimentary snacks were offered in dishes at the bar, including pickles that bore a physical resemblance to eyeballs; establishment policy required the purchase of a drink in order to partake of the bar snacks.\n\n",

A number of attractive native Zeltron males and females became frequent patrons of the cantina, as did Jool herself.\n\nTrue to its name, the cantina was constructed as a lush, oasis-like \"paradise,\" complete with lush landscaping, an indoor/outdoor bar, and a poolside cabana and lounge area; the large natural pool was always kept full and pristine by the giant, 100-foot-tall waterfalls which delivered a constant flow of water into the oasis. The daring and physically fit Zeltrons, as well as a number of other species, would occasionally dive from the top of the falls into the pool below, a feat which was liable to become somewhat competitive, especially between males; however, the multiple-story-high dive was still considered a very risky pastime, especially for the average Human, to attempt. considered too. Nevertheless, Cade Skywalker and Jariah Syn did just that, with Cade using the Force to slow their fall and lessen their impact upon the water's surface; Skywalker later remarked that his Master, Wolf Sazen, would kill him if he saw him using the Force for fun or for selfish thrill-seeking.\n\nThe pirate Rav arrived at Paradise with two of his henchmen as Skywalker, Syn and crew were partying. Queen Jool, who was also present, had just told Cade that although she loved him, his rowdiness in her cantina was becoming a liability and she needed him to keep the potential damages to a minimum. He obliged, just as he pushed one of Rav's sidekicks off the waterfall and struck the other in the neck in the pool. Upon seeing this, Rav offered Cade and his crew a mission on Wayland for one million credits.\n\n",

It was a relatively small cantina, and the building itself was built in a style resembling other Mos Enthan structures. It consisted chiefly of two rooms, separated by a short flight of stairs. The outermost room was occupied by the entrance area, where customers waited in line to be seated, and which also held the bar. The inner room contained all the establishment's tables and a stage for musical acts.\n\nThe walls and floor of the cantina were made from a brown stone, and were utterly unembellished. Drinks of several colors were served in Thirsty Bantha: green, purple, blue, orange, and yellow. Although initially somewhat plain and moderately decorated, the cantina received a number of upgrades over time. Customer capacity was increased from two tables to six when Nia Adea began supervision of the cantina, and a number of aesthetic aids and entertainment products were installed to increase customer satisfaction. Two droids were purchased to help mix drinks. With their aid, at least two new drink varieties were added to the cantina's repertoire.\n\n",

It was situated among the warehouses and docking bays of Kelada starport and was owned by Lorana.\n\nThe cantina had three separate entrances and its walls were covered with mirrors to make the room seem bigger. The bar followed the irregular edges of the walls and even extended into the center of the room in some places. The bar was somewhat labyrinthine and difficult to navigate, and the mirrored walls added to the difficulty. There were no tables, but only stools and raised and lowered sections of the bar. The room was typically dimly lit, and less than talented bands would sometimes provide atmospheric music from the stage alcove.\n\nLorana's Labyrinth was popular among spacers and local workers and would be almost completely packed in the afternoons and evenings. Lorana had a soft spot for smugglers who often came to the cantina to get lost in the crowd. She had several trapdoors installed around the bar to help her smuggler friends escape pursuers. The Galactic Empire would raid it often to catch wanted smugglers but very few were caught. It was shut down by the Empire, but reopened again soon after.\n\n",

A layer of haze permeated throughout the bar, which was the result of a combination of alcohol, sweat and other substances. Outside the front of the bar was a worn, poorly-maintained neon sign displaying the name of the bar, but which was missing several letters and announced the establishment incorrectly as \"Bo-c-s.\"\n\nInside, Botcha's had tables for its patrons to sit at and a bar area from which alcoholic beverages could be purchased. During the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the bar was attended by a trio of Ugnaught bartenders whose clothing was so stained that the original colors were difficult to determine. A raised walkway was included behind the bar, upon which the diminutive Ugnaughts stood to provide them sufficient reach to pass drinks to the establishment's patrons. The Ugnaughts stared and and made derisory comments to any male patrons of the bar that they considered to be feminine in appearance. Drink prices at the bar ranged from two to ten credits.\n\n",

With the help of this group of rebels, the bartender and waiters managed to subdue the group of brawlers. Soon after, the local police arrived, though they were content to leave the group of rebels alone as they had fought simply to protect the bar. When the rebels sat down for a meal, they noticed a particular item on the menu, Egot's Lava Crab Feast, and so ordered it, assuming (correctly) that it would be their next step to meeting Egot Pai-4-Yem. The rebels were taken into the back of the cantina to choose which rock crab they wanted for their meal.

It was frequented by locals of all sorts, ranging from Imperial stormtroopers to moisture farmers. The cantina was named after the non-sentient bantha creature. Robb's initial hope for the cantina was to provide himself with a more relaxing life than afforded to him by his previous career choice. This proved difficult, as the cantina did not produce enough revenue to run smoothly. Robb was forced to borrow credits from the Devaronian loan shark Varak'Cha to keep his business afloat. When Robb failed to pay back the loan, he was given a fifteen-day deadline to produce the money, lest something bad happen to the cantina.\n\nRobb was able to enlist the help of his old Human friend Nia Adea, who handled all customer interaction in Thirsty Bantha, and provided Robb with her recipe for the drink additive flavor syrup. With Adea's assistance, Robb significantly boosted Thirsty Bantha's popularity and made a tidy profit, enough to repay Varak'Cha.\n\n",

        "content": "# Thirsty Bantha - History[]\n\nThirsty Bantha was owned and operated by the Besalisk Robb, who sought a quieter life after making a career as a bounty hunter for several years. His initial business plan of both preparing and serving all drinks on his own made for mediocre revenue, and he was eventually forced to borrow money from the local Devaronian loan shark Varak'Cha.\n\nUnable to pay back the loan, Robb was threatened and physically assaulted by the Devaronian, and was given fifteen days to scrape together the credits. However, unbeknownst to Robb, his old friend, the Human Nia Adea, had witnessed the exchange with the loan shark. She presented herself and offered to help him raise the money needed. They implemented a division of labor: Robb would prepare the drinks, while Adea waited the tables. Additionally, Adea entrusted Robb with her recipe for flavor syrup, intended to make beverages taste better.\n\nAdea's assistance turned things around financially for Thirsty Bantha. As the cantina grew in popularity, Robb increased the establishment's capacity by adding several more tables, as well as implementing several upgrades to increase customer satisfaction and boost efficiency. An air conditioning system and a water cooler were installed, all the tables were replaced with models that enabled patrons to play holochess, potted plants were spread around to enhance the aesthetic aspect of the cantina, and a helper droid was employed to help prepare drinks faster. Six days after Adea's arrival, Thirsty Bantha was visited by the local Hutt crime lord Wunda, who demanded to be served large amounts of drinks. After spending the entire day in the cantina, he left without paying.\n\nThe cantina continued to grow in financial terms, and additional tables were added, along with a lugjack machine, improved lights, and a second helper droid. A Bith band was also hired to play music during opening hours. At the end of the fifteen days, Varak'Cha returned to the cantina to collect his credits. As Robb handed him the money, Adea made an insulting facial gesture at the loan shark, provoking him enough to push her violently. As the Devaronian was about to exit Thirsty Bantha, he was greeted by Wunda, whom Varak'Cha owed money. Wunda's Gamorrean guards promptly appropriated the funds and gave them to the Hutt. With the cantina back on its feet financially, Adea left to pursue other interests.\n\n",

In 31 BBY, the band was Geedo Loken and the Lo-keys. The Bar also included a feature called The Pool Bar, where the customers could drink while in the water; the Bar provided them with floating cups to avoid unexpected surprises.\n\nAlthough Hurrwarr could throw any hooligan out of his bar, or more than one at a time, locals tried to convince newcomers to play Stump-the-Wookiee-Bartender, a supposed game with predictable results.\n\nIn 31 BBY, a guest of the hotel named Dr. Shilaea Motacc was a common sight in the bar, as she enjoyed Double-Dip Outer Rim Rumdrops. Two days after Dr. Motacc was given up for dead after a cave-in, a stranger went to the Cabana Bar and bought all the available stock of Rumdrops, paying in cash and during Hurrwarr's break. The stranger left a pair of spectacles on the bar.\n\n",

Inside, the cantina had a typical bar setup, including chairs and tables for guests to sit at and an area attended by a barkeeper from which drinks could be purchased. Around 31 BBY, the elderly Human Norben worked as the bartender of the Falling Rodian and would harass individuals who ventured into the establishment if they did not purchase drinks.\n\nThe cantina's customers included Humans and aliens alike and it catered to a variety of tastes. The bar was awash with different sounds and sensations, owing to the various exotic infusions and substances consumed by its clientele, including strangly colored ales, smouldering braziers and hokkums of Glitterstim.\n\nOutside the cantina was a sign that depicted an alarmed Rodian falling off the railings of a cloud city. Beneath the sign was a notice, written in Basic and accompanied by pictographs, which warned that blaster weapons and droids were not permitted in the bar. Little was done to enforce these restrictions and the majority of the cantina's patrons were armed.\n\n",

Circa 31 BBY, the Bimm information broker Ginder came into the possession of the head of L8O-RC, an L8O-series protocol droid, whose memory chips recorded of the hiding place of treasures of the Hutt crime lord Riboga. Under threat from various parties who sought to acquire the head for their own ends, Ginder sought sent a message to a group of adventurers to meet him at the Fallen Rodian, hoping that they could help him out of his predicament. The Bimm ventured to the bar every afternoon as he awaited the adventurers, staying there as long as he could.\n\nSeveral days later, the adventurers arrived at the Falling Rodian and waited there for the Bimm information broker to appear. At the same time a trio of thugs searching for the protocol droid head on behalf of the criminal kingpin Nirama\u2014the Sullustan Jubieck and the Trandoshans Orix and Dimogog\u2014also came to the cantina, to drink and discuss business. After the adventurers had been waiting for about an hour, Ginder arrived at the Falling Rodian. The information broker immediately thrust them the droid head and requested that they help him flee Genarius and keep the head out of the hands of the factions who sought it.\n\nThree plain clothed soldiers of the Thaereian military, another group seeking the protocol droid head, arrived at the bar amid Ginder's meeting with the adventurers. Spotting the droid head, the soldiers claimed it to be stolen and attempted to confiscate it. The confrontation drew the attention of Jubieck and the two Trandoshans, who also also sighted the head and demanded that the adventurers hand it over to them. A three way violent struggle ensured between the adventurers, soldiers and thugs for possession of the head, while Norben hid behind the bar and the cantina's other occupants headed for the exit. Following an explosion outside, which shattered the windows of the Falling Rodian, the head rolled over to the adventurers and they fled the bar with it in their possession.\n\n",

However, most of the interior shots were from Stage 6 at Elstree Studios on April 13\u201321.\n\nFor the background alien babble of the A New Hope scene, sound technician Ben Burtt had some crew members to inhale helium and record them chatting although it took four takes until they were able to get over the laughter and be able to converse; the oxygen deprivation also caused a tipsy effect in their session. The females (Lucy Wilson and Bunny Alsup) were recorded separately and later their voices were slowed down; the opposite was made with the males (Michael Kitchens, Howie Hammerman, Todd Boekelheide) and then they were mixed to create some of the background soundscape. More specific effects included the \"laughter\" of a hippopotamus and a spring peeper frog; a friend of Burtt's also was recorded reading Latin, and his voice was chopped in a synthesizer.\n\nChalmun's Cantina was the same cantina in the now non-canonical The Star Wars Holiday Special, set months after A New Hope, and shown during a night shift.\n\nA skit on a 1977 episode of The Richard Pryor Show took place in the \"Star Wars Bar,\" with Pryor playing the bartender. Though the skit did not reuse the original sets, many of the masks from A New Hope's cantina scene were used for the patrons.\n\nThe cantina was featured in an official 1979 drunk-driving PSA. In 2007, the official site made it available for viewing.\n\n",

It was located on Inner Curved Street in the outskirts of the Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine. The building housed a bar area with a maximum occupancy of 102 patrons, with seats at the bar and at a variety of tables and booths. The heads of several creatures, including a crocodina, were mounted on the walls around the bar.\n\nThe cantina's bar had twelve drinks available on tap, with the size of a standard drink being 16 ounces. The most popular drinks at the cantina were blue milk, Tatooine Sunset, Jawa Juice, Yatooni Boska, Tatooni Junko, and Hutt's Delight. There was also a secret drinks list that patrons could ask for, which included the items Red Dwarf, Cassandra Sunrise, Nova Blaster, and Flameout. The Bith \"Fiery\" Figrin D'an, kloo horn player and leader of the Modal Nodes, was a regular act at Chalmun's Cantina.\n\nFrequent clients were privy to a number of special accommodations that could be requested from the owners. If a patron were to ask for the Nova Blaster with Savareen Brandy swapped for Corellian, the patron would then be escorted into a hidden gun closet where they could purchase black market weapons. Patrons could also pay a significant fee to be allowed into a back room, where they were afforded privacy -both from the bar's security and other clients. There was also a signal jammer hidden behind the building to afford extra privacy.\n\n",

Under his employ was the gruff human Wuher, who, despite not being the friendliest bartender in the galaxy, was respected by his customers for never asking any questions, and Ackmena, the female night-shift bartender, who had friendlier manners.\n\nKenobi and Luke Skywalker came to the cantina shortly before the destruction of Alderaan to charter a course to the doomed planet, in order to deliver technical readouts on the Empire's Death Star. After having their droids tossed out due to the cantina's no-droid policy, they hired the smuggler Han Solo and his compatriot Chewbacca, who needed a way to pay off their debt to Jabba the Hutt. Their visit was not uneventful; the Jedi Master and his apprentice were harassed and confronted by Doctor Cornelius Evazan and his thug Ponda Baba, the latter of whom lost his arm after provoking Kenobi. Afterwards, Solo had an altercation with the bounty hunter Greedo, who was eager to collect the bounty on Solo. Solo, however, killed him with a single shot after Greedo foolishly fired first\u2014and missed. Han then tossed Wuher some credits and left the cantina to prep the Millennium Falcon for the two fugitives.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader employed Fett to track down and capture the mysterious pilot who destroyed the Death Star. Knowing that Solo frequented Mos Eisley, the bounty hunter would interrogate and promptly murder his victims after they failed to provide any sufficient leads. Entering the Mos Eisley Cantina, Boba Fett addressed the gathered crowd that he would not leave until he was provided the information he sought. After brutally wounding a six-armed alien and intimidating the bar patrons, Wuher responded that no one knew the boy, and that he had only come in some time ago with Kenobi. After shooting a length of fibercord and causing a fleeing patron to fall down, the teen soon broke down and told Boba the boy's name\u2014Luke Skywalker. He then shot the boy and headed towards Ben Kenobi's home in order to discover more about Luke's identity. Unbeknownst to Boba, his discovery of Skywalker's name at Chalmun's Cantina would soon allow Darth Vader to realize that he had a son.\n\nBy 3 ABY, it was taboo to sit at the booth where Han Solo shot Greedo. A superstition arose that everyone who sat at that booth got shot. Later Kay Vess came to meet Hoss where he gave Nix away to be sold to Jabba Desilijic Tiure.\n\n",

        "content": "# Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina - Galactic Civil War[]\n\nNearly two decades later, the cantina was still profiting under the stewardship of Chalmun, bringing in profits even under the reign of the Galactic Empire. The droid-hating Wuher maintained the bar during the day, and the cheerful bar wench Ackmena tended the place at night. Bouncers such as Tork would regulate the rowdy crowd, tossing out those who shot other patrons. Other employees included Lurval and the bartender Muna Skish.\n\nAt one point a holographic video screen was installed by Chalmun for sports broadcasts, but it was removed after the HoloNet entertainment feeds faced constant interruptions from Imperial alerts. The cantina gained a permanent band when the Bith Figrin D'an gambled away the ownership of the Modal Nodes' instruments in a rigged card game with Kardue'sai'Malloc. One reason Chalmun's Cantina was so popular among spacers was the Fabritech droid detector that Chalmun installed in the foyer. For a long time, Imperial Sentry Droids made private discussions between smugglers and crime bosses all but impossible. While the detector didn't keep the Sentry Droids out, it did warn everyone that their activities and discussions were about to come under Imperial scrutiny. This enabled everyone time to compose themselves and present a perfectly innocent demeanor. Chalmun's also had a strict \"No Droids\" policy to prevent people from bringing their own droids into the Cantina with them.\n\nFollowing the deaths of Owen and Beru Lars, in 0 BBY, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and the young Luke Skywalker made their way to the cantina to look for a pilot to the Alderaan system. There, they finally met with the pilot who would soon fly them to Alderaan: Han Solo and his copilot Chewbacca. During talks over a trip to Alderaan, Skywalker encountered the Aqualish scoundrel Ponda Baba, who threatened to kill him. In defense of the young man, Master Kenobi removed Baba's arm with his lightsaber. When the Jedi and his charge quickly fled attention in the cantina, Han Solo prepared to leave but was stopped by the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo. Greedo, employed by Jabba the Hutt to kill Solo in compensation of a debt the smuggler owed, managed to fire a single shot that missed before Solo killed him.\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Talon Karrde and Dravis supervised the operations of the Smuggler Alliance from the back rooms of the Mos Eisley Cantina.\n\nIn 1 ABY, the Quarren Gendra recruited several spacers, including a trader and an entertainer, to help his friend Chalmun who was facing several problems at the cantina. The trader crafted new glassware and was eager to prepare meat jerky and spiced tea for the customers of the cantina. The entertainer agreed with performing in the cantina, dancing and playing music for the patrons who where delighted by the shows.\n\nIn 1 ABY, Tatooine, along with the rest of the system, was put under Imperial curfew by an Imperial Moff. Ackmena, the bartender at the cantina at the time, received the message, and responded by singing \"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye\" to her guests as she ushered them out the door. During the curfew period, droids were also assigned to a waiting area if they accompanied patrons. At one point, a Jawa infected with Bledsoe's disease, died shortly after drinking, which caused the bartender to initially think he drank himself to death until a patron revealed otherwise. Presumably, everyone in the cantina that day died from infection, save for Luke Skywalker and Anduvil, who managed to escape in time as soon as they witnessed the Jawa's death.\n\nChalmun's Cantina was firebombed shortly after the death of Jabba the Hutt, forcing a rebuilding. During the chaos surrounding Jabba's death, the Cantina was attacked again by a swoop gang led by Mossol the Menace, but the repair droids put out the fire. A group of spacers then helped Chalmun free his friend Rejeff.\n\nIt remained open five years after the Battle of Endor, when Han Solo returned there to meet with the smuggler Dravis in an unsuccessful attempt to enlist him in cargo work for the New Republic. The cantina was also open at least 15 years later, a man named Zekk\u2014working as a bounty hunter\u2014sought Boba Fett to share with him information on Bornan Thul.\n\n",

        "content": "# Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina - Layout[]\n\nA single-story building made of sandstone, the cantina consisted of a bar area, private offices, a VIP lounge, a private hangar, a basement, and a phony shop in the rear. With a maximum occupancy of 102 humanoids, the facility catered to all sorts from across the galaxy, with spacious areas and wide arched doorways to allow patrons of all sizes passage.\n\nEntering through a small portal on one side of the building, a small passage curved around into the main bar area. The bar, featuring many themed spigots which resembled the head of an IG-series assassin droid, was capable of producing several dozen drinks of Chalmun's concocting. Surrounded by eight different alcoves filled with stools, tables, and even a bandstand, the bar wrapped from the public area around into the more private back room. Outside of public view, several secret rooms existed to house sleeping areas for fugitives fleeing the law. At the very back of the building, an open-air hangar housed Chalmun's private shuttle, which could be used routinely to transport liquor, or for escape.\n\nInside one of the building's domed portions, Chalmun kept his offices. Including his own private bar, the Wookiee's office space was home to his security chief and several confiscated weapons. The back rooms of the building ran parallel to the outside bazaar, which sold droid parts and scrap metal. Chalmun maintained a shop out back that sold clothes and other goods. Its domed roof sported a communications jammer disguised as a vaporator.\n\nUnderneath the cantina, a small cellar had been built long before Chalmun came to Tatooine. The bartender, Wuher, used the basement to cook up new brews for his clients; previous owners had used it as a catacomb.\n\n",

Most of the interior shots were from Stage 6 at Elstree Studios on April 13\u201321.\n\nChalmun's Cantina was also in The Star Wars Holiday Special, set months after A New Hope, and shown during a night shift.\n\nAn IG-88 head can be seen behind the bartender when Ponda Baba's arm is cut off. A full one can also be seen in The Empire Strikes Back when Chewbacca is looking for C-3PO\u2014both are white, while earlier in The Empire Strikes Back an IG-88 bounty hunter is colored gray.\n\nIt is possible that the Episode I podracer Gasgano was present around the time of Luke Skywalker's meeting with Han Solo. Although not seen in the movie, Star Wars: Complete Locations points out a \"multifingered former podracer, now a deft pickpocket\" who can be located inside the cantina. It may be another Xexto podracer; however, the only officially named Xexto podracer is Gasgano.\n\nThe cantina was featured in an official 1979 drunk-driving PSA. In 2007, the official site made it available.\n\nA skit on a 1977 episode of The Richard Pryor Show took place in the \"Star Wars Bar,\" with Pryor playing the bartender. Though the skit did not reuse the original sets, many of the masks from A New Hope's cantina scene were used for the patrons.\n\nThe \"It'th Greedo'th Uncle\" card from the Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire trading card set mistakenly refers to the Mos Eisley cantina as a \"casino.\"\n\n",

Two of the establishment's employees included the hostess Selbie and a Wookiee bartender. In 40 BBY, Lord Regent Rael Averross visited the cantina with his associates after riding a Pijal varactyl. When a Chagrian patron began vying for Selbie's attention, Averross gleefully brandished his lightsaber and embarrassed the customer until he left. Afterward, Averross saw a nearby holoscreen displaying the burning of a Czerka warehouse. He quickly left the establishment, believing that the incident was caused by the Opposition performance troupe.\n\nThe cantina was carved out of a dingy rock and had a muddy appearance. Due to this, some felt the establishment's smell was similar to that of the cantina's Wookiee bartender. During the Republic Era, the cantina served alcoholic beverages, and played music in a seating area equipped with a holoscreen.\n\n",
