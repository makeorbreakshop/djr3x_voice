Loi'e reached the balcony and realized the officer was not the same man who stole her son from her, but rather her son himself. Before she could react, she was thrown off the balcony by the officer's KX-series security droid. As Loi'e began to fight the officer and the now-aggressive stormtroopers, Mee'ma continued waving their arms, intensifying the music.\n\nAfter more fighting, H\u00e9tis returned to the stage and fought the stormtroopers with Loi'e.

Loi'e went to the top of the cabaret, pulling the officer with her to attempt speaking to him.

Shortly before the performance, Mee'ma was with the rest of the crew members above the stage. He sat upon a barrel smoking a pipe before Loi'e descended the stairs to the backstage. Loi'e asked if everyone was ready, and they all stopped what they were doing and stepped to the center of the room around a glowing disk in the floor. The crew members intoned a mantra: \"To the ones we lost,\" as the lights in the cabaret dimmed and a blue light replaced them.\n\nAs the curtains rose, Mee'ma began to play his part\u2014pipe still in his mouth\u2014waving his arms inside a swirling arch made of twisting metal and vibrating, multi-colored glass, which created music. As Mee'ma continued to wave his arms, Loi'e descended from the backstage ceiling room, her gown flowing and slowing her fall as she began her part of the performance, placing the trackers on the stormtroopers and their gear. As the act continued, Loi'e spotted an Imperial officer sitting in a balcony\u2014one she believed had kidnapped her son twenty years prior. In a panic, she fell from her high position as Mee'ma watched, staying still.
