        "content": "# BX-series droid commando - Characteristics[]\n\nPart of an advanced droid series, BX-series were more adaptable, even smarter & much sturdier than their B1-series counterparts. They were programmed with improved combat tactics and battlefield awareness and equipped with glowing white photoreceptors. Commando droid captains and other high-ranking commando droids bore white identifiers on their heads and chests. The unit was designed for infiltration and heavy combat, whereas the unit's programming prepared it for combat, assassination missions, and clandestine infiltration tasks. The BX unit ND-5 would later recall that, as a battle droid, he was concerned with following his orders and destroying whomever he was sent against, instead of caring about why he was performing those duties. ND-5 feared even later into his life he would be able to do nothing more than hunt and destroy targets, but his companion Kay Vess assured ND-5 he was more than just a war machine. The body of a BX unit was made from a titanium-reinforced steel that served as strong blaster resistant armor. BX units stationed as security in the Spire prison were plated with cortosis.\n\nDue to a more compact head than the B1, commando droids could don Phase I clone trooper armor for infiltration missions. Their heavy armor improved durability and allowed them to withstand several direct hits from a DC-15A blaster carbine, though a point-blank headshot with an ELG-3A blaster pistol was capable of destroying one instantly. Additionally commando droids were extremely agile and acrobatic, with their midsection armor offering more flexibility over B1 battle droids. They were also able to move and react much faster than a standard battle droid performing several flips in one. They were even able to continue fighting after sustaining significant damage such as having their legs sliced off with a lightsaber, in contrast to standard B1 battle droids that could be defeated simply by knocking them over.\n\nFor improved infiltration capabilities, commando droids were able to alter their vocabulators in order to imitate clone troopers. However, their awkward movements in the armor and atypical responses to orders (usually \"roger, roger,\" a common battle-droid response) meant that observant individuals could see through the ruse. Commando droids were also quite strong, as one was able to lift Clone Captain Rex up by his neck. Commando droids were skilled in melee combat, using vibroswords in close quarters as well as being very agile, able to leap and contort their bodies to avoid blasterfire and surprise enemies. While they had numerous improvements over rank-and-file B1 battle droids, their production costs proved to be much higher, causing the B1 to continue to remain the standard infantry for the Confederacy. Commando droids' also had combat programming.\n\n",

The Confederate commander Darts D'Nar had two with him as his guards when he negotiated with Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi for his surrender. Kenobi fought D'Nar in hand-to-hand combat, and this distracted him while Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano disarmed all of D'Nar's bombs in the city.

Three commando droids later chased Morgan, but she hid in a tree, fooling two of the droids, though the last one stayed back to find and fight Morgan, though the Nightsister triumphed, despite the droid's tough design. Her victory would be a small pyrrhic win however, since the Separatist Droid Army continued the massacre of the people with Grievous's laugh echoing throughout the burning land.\n\nSeveral commando droids were deployed to the Onderonian capital city Iziz.

The commando droid Eighty-One was active during the Imperial Era but was destroyed during the hunt on Chandar's Folly. On the planet Koboh, commando droids and other former Separatist forces were reprogrammed and used as soldiers by the Bedlam Raiders.\n\nAfter the destruction of the first Death Star, Darth Vader's position became endangered, as his master, Darth Sidious, planned to replace him with the help of a rogue cybernetics doctor named Cylo. In order to cement his place and reassure his master, Vader enlisted Doctor Aphra and forcefully took a droid factory from Karina, using it to create an army of commando droids to deal with Cylo, and lost half of them doing so.\n\nLater, Vader used his commando droids during the final battle of the War on Shu-Torun. One of Vader's assassin droids, 0-0-0, had also modified the droids to have cyber syringes in order to drain the blood of the enemy troops. Horrified at the commando units suddenly proclaiming that they would bring death to their organic foes, the enemy army surrendered. Afterward, Vader sent his droids to help 0-0-0, BT-1, and Krrsantan capture Aphra. The Tech Masters used commando droids as guards.\n\nLater, Aphra was pursued by a monster droid bounty hunter, which was made from BX-series and B2 battle droid parts. The bounty hunter was destroyed during the skirmish on Arbiflux. The Commando droid ND-5, owned by the crime lord Jaylen Vrax, worked with Kay Vess in pulling off a heist on Sliro's Mansion. In 5 ABY, the Siniteen prison builder Golas Aram used several commando droids to guard his private compound on the planet Irudiru. The New Republic operatives Sinjir Rath Velus and Jas Emari fought and defeated several of Aram's droids with the help of the New Republic Special Forces soldier Jom Barell.\n\n",

        "content": "# BX-series droid commando - Elite troops of the Droid Army[]\n\nOne commando droid once claimed itself to have been built five \"cycles\" before the Clone Wars had even begun, which made that specific commando older than their fellow battle droids. However, the BX-series was considered \"new\" in 22 BBY during the early period of the Clone Wars. Indeed, the BX was undergoing preliminary testing early in the war. During that testing period, General Grievous's forces took note of the successful BX tests. On Grievous's behalf, the droid C-5DS contacted the Akiva production plant with an advance order for twelve thousand BX commandos for use in Grievous's forces. At least one commando droid took part in the Battle of Antar 4, where the BX unit fought well.\n\nIn 22 BBY, at a point in the Clone Wars when commando droids were still considered new, General Grievous used commando droids to infiltrate and take control of the Republic's Rishi Moon Station. At first, the droids landed in a Droch-class boarding ship and, after ambushing the deck officer, CT-327, they forced their way into the base and killed Clone Sergeant O'Niner and all of his men save four clones that escaped through a ventilation shaft. They were able to maintain control of the station until Clone Commander Cody and Clone Captain Rex arrived to inspect the station. Along with the survivors of the Rishi Station unit, Cody and Rex were able to retake the listening post from the commando droids and destroy them.\n\nHowever, droid reinforcements arrived at the station, so one of the station's clone troopers, Hevy, sacrificed himself destroy the base. The commando droids had hard-wired the base's all-clear signal, so the only way to alert the Republic of a planned Separatist attack on Kamino was to destroy the station, but the detonator did not link up with the tibanna that was to be used to destroy the station. This forced Hevy to activate it himself, so Hevy sacrificed himself for the closest thing a clone trooper could call home. The base was destroyed, and the Republic stopped receiving the all-clear signal, which alerted them that something was wrong. A Republic fleet arrived at the Rishi moon, and Grievous and his fleet, being outgunned, were forced to retreat.\n\nAt least two commando droids were stationed in Lessu during the Battle of Ryloth. There they attempted to stop the ARF troopers Stak and Razor from activating the plasma bridge, but were defeated. The two ARF troopers activated the bridge, and Lessu was ultimately taken by the Republic and the Twi'lek Resistance. Separatist leader Wat Tambor was captured, and the Separatist occupation of Ryloth came to an end.\n\nGeneral Grievous used commando droids when he boarded Jedi Council member Eeth Koth's flagship, the Steadfast, when he captured Koth. Later, in the Saleucami system, Grievous and his tactical droid, TV-94, then used them against fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia, and Anakin Skywalker as they rescued Koth from Grievous. A pair of commando droids then acted as snipers after Grievous was forced to crash-land on Saleucami's surface. One of the droids then shot Captain Rex as he approached them leading a speeder patrol. The shot pierced the clone captain's armor and would have gone straight through his heart had it been two inches to the left. Both droids were promptly run down and shot by Rex's companions.\n\nWhile Rex was recovering at a farmstead, he discovered that it belonged to a clone deserter named Cut Lawquane, whose adopted children stumbled across a Separatist escape pod that had crashed in one of their fields. Their exploration of the pod led to them accidentally activating its complement of commando droids, who proceeded to attack the homestead as Rex and Cut defended it. Despite being heavily damaged, the droids gave the clones a considerable fight and caused extensive damage to the homestead before they were all destroyed.\n\n",

Later, in the Saleucami system, Grievous and his tactical droid, TV-94, then used them against fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia, and Anakin Skywalker as they rescued Koth from Grievous. A pair of commando droids then acted as snipers after Grievous was forced to crash-land on Saleucami's surface. One of the droids then shot Captain Rex as he approached them leading a speeder patrol. The shot pierced the clone captain's armor and would have gone straight through his heart had it been two inches to the left. Both droids were promptly run down and shot by Rex's companions.\n\nWhile Rex was recovering at a farmstead, he discovered that it belonged to a clone deserter named Cut Lawquane, whose adopted children stumbled across a Separatist escape pod that had crashed in one of their fields. Their exploration of the pod led to them accidentally activating its complement of commando droids, who proceeded to attack the homestead as Rex and Cut defended it.

He obtained information about the First Order and the location of Supreme Leader Snoke while posted on the planet Kaddak. Poe Dameron, his commander C-3PO, and BB-8 undertook a mission to rescue him. Nunzix showed little gratitude to his rescuers and the spy droid vowed to only release the information once they returned to the Resistance base on D'Qar.\n\nPoe came to suspect that the information was ruse by the First Order Security Bureau Agent Terex to lure the Resistance into a trap. Terex and the Ranc Gang pursued Poe and the droids. N1-ZX and his rescuers crash-landed on a desert planet and fled into a cave. With N1-ZX unwilling to fight, Poe overrode his programming with a droid personality template supplied by his friend Temmin Wexley.

The commando droid Eighty-One was active during the Imperial Era but was destroyed during the hunt on Chandar's Folly. On the planet Koboh, commando droids and other former Separatist forces were reprogrammed and used as soldiers by the Bedlam Raiders.\n\nAfter the destruction of the first Death Star, Darth Vader's position became endangered, as his master, Darth Sidious, planned to replace him with the help of a rogue cybernetics doctor named Cylo. In order to cement his place and reassure his master, Vader enlisted Doctor Aphra and forcefully took a droid factory from Karina, using it to create an army of commando droids to deal with Cylo, and lost half of them doing so.\n\nLater, Vader used his commando droids during the final battle of the War on Shu-Torun. One of Vader's assassin droids, 0-0-0, had also modified the droids to have cyber syringes in order to drain the blood of the enemy troops. Horrified at the commando units suddenly proclaiming that they would bring death to their organic foes, the enemy army surrendered. Afterward, Vader sent his droids to help 0-0-0, BT-1, and Krrsantan capture Aphra. The Tech Masters used commando droids as guards.\n\nLater, Aphra was pursued by a monster droid bounty hunter, which was made from BX-series and B2 battle droid parts. The bounty hunter was destroyed during the skirmish on Arbiflux. The Commando droid ND-5, owned by the crime lord Jaylen Vrax, worked with Kay Vess in pulling off a heist on Sliro's Mansion. In 5 ABY, the Siniteen prison builder Golas Aram used several commando droids to guard his private compound on the planet Irudiru. The New Republic operatives Sinjir Rath Velus and Jas Emari fought and defeated several of Aram's droids with the help of the New Republic Special Forces soldier Jom Barell.\n\n",

There, they were able to impersonate the Senate Commandos stationed at the entrance. They later escaped along with Bane, Ziro, and the other bounty hunters. These commando droids were adore with the Black Sun symbol and spotted a dark blue color.\n\nCommando droids were also used as guards at the Citadel under Warden Osi Sobeck, denoted by special yellow livery on their torsos. There they guarded the prisoners, served as security, and operated the laser cannons.\n\nThe Confederate minister Rish Loo used commando droids against Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala when his plan was exposed. Though the droids were destroyed in fairly short order, they distracted the two long enough for Loo to escape.\n\nOn Kiros, commando droids drove Flitknot Speeder Bikes and AATs when the Republic forces arrived. The Confederate commander Darts D'Nar had two with him as his guards when he negotiated with Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi for his surrender. Kenobi fought D'Nar in hand-to-hand combat, and this distracted him while Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano disarmed all of D'Nar's bombs in the city. After being informed of this, Kenobi swiftly destroyed both droids by lifting them into the air and crushing them with the Force. D'Nar escaped from Kenobi by using a bomb he had hidden in his T-series tactical droid, much to the tactical droid's horror, but Skywalker and Tano caught up to D'Nar, and he was captured by Tano.\n\nDuring the Confederate\u2013Republic peace conference at Sundari on Mandalore, commando droids served as guards to the Confederate delegation. Several then forcibly removed Onderon's Senator, Lux Bonteri, when he spoke out against Count Dooku for his part in the murder of Lux's mother. After Padawan Ahsoka Tano rescued Bonteri from his execution, the commando droids then fought the Senate Guards under Captain Taggart when the peace conference broke down.\n\nCommando droids were used by Grievous when Dooku ordered the destruction of the Nightsisters of Dathomir. During the Battle of Dathomir, commando droids were deployed by Grievous to combat the Nightsisters, and were with Grievous when he and his droids found Mother Talzin and Old Daka in a secret cave in the Nightsister lair. A commando droid used a rocket launcher to destroy the cave's wall, allowing Grievous and several droids to get in and eliminate the Nightsisters inside. Around that time, several commando droids fought a group of Nightsisters while Grievous fought Selena before killing the future Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth's mother. Three commando droids later chased Morgan, but she hid in a tree, fooling two of the droids, though the last one stayed back to find and fight Morgan, though the Nightsister triumphed, despite the droid's tough design. Her victory would be a small pyrrhic win however, since the Separatist Droid Army continued the massacre of the people with Grievous's laugh echoing throughout the burning land.\n\nSeveral commando droids were deployed to the Onderonian capital city Iziz. They led the attack on the Onderon rebels' base in the highlands, killing many rebels alongside the new Separatist HMP droid gunship.\n\n",

Several commando droids were also on the Maxillipede shuttle under the command of Commander Kraken used to transport clone trooper Tup from Ringo Vinda, as the trooper had mysteriously killed Jedi General Tiplar in what had been an early execution of Order 66 due to a failure in the clone's behavioral modification biochip.

A pair of commando droids then acted as snipers after Grievous was forced to crash-land on Saleucami's surface. One of the droids then shot Captain Rex as he approached them leading a speeder patrol. The shot pierced the clone captain's armor and would have gone straight through his heart had it been two inches to the left. Both droids were promptly run down and shot by Rex's companions.\n\nWhile Rex was recovering at a farmstead, he discovered that it belonged to a clone deserter named Cut Lawquane, whose adopted children stumbled across a Separatist escape pod that had crashed in one of their fields. Their exploration of the pod led to them accidentally activating its complement of commando droids, who proceeded to attack the homestead as Rex and Cut defended it. Despite being heavily damaged, the droids gave the clones a considerable fight and caused extensive damage to the homestead before they were all destroyed.\n\n",

Nunzix was programmed with a self-preservative software that made him obsessed with preserving his own life. Nunzix had a grumpy and selfish demeanor and was unwilling to risk his own life. He obtained information about the First Order and the location of Supreme Leader Snoke while posted on the planet Kaddak. Poe Dameron, his commander C-3PO, and BB-8 undertook a mission to rescue him. Nunzix showed little gratitude to his rescuers and the spy droid vowed to only release the information once they returned to the Resistance base on D'Qar.\n\nPoe came to suspect that the information was ruse by the First Order Security Bureau Agent Terex to lure the Resistance into a trap. Terex and the Ranc Gang pursued Poe and the droids. N1-ZX and his rescuers crash-landed on a desert planet and fled into a cave. With N1-ZX unwilling to fight, Poe overrode his programming with a droid personality template supplied by his friend Temmin Wexley. Nunzix assumed the B1 battle droid Mister Bones' personality and slaughtered many of Terex's gangsters before being gunned down and disintegrated by Terex himself.\n\n",

The commando droid Eighty-One was active during the Imperial Era but was destroyed during the hunt on Chandar's Folly. On the planet Koboh, commando droids and other former Separatist forces were reprogrammed and used as soldiers by the Bedlam Raiders.\n\nAfter the destruction of the first Death Star, Darth Vader's position became endangered, as his master, Darth Sidious, planned to replace him with the help of a rogue cybernetics doctor named Cylo. In order to cement his place and reassure his master, Vader enlisted Doctor Aphra and forcefully took a droid factory from Karina, using it to create an army of commando droids to deal with Cylo, and lost half of them doing so.\n\nLater, Vader used his commando droids during the final battle of the War on Shu-Torun. One of Vader's assassin droids, 0-0-0, had also modified the droids to have cyber syringes in order to drain the blood of the enemy troops. Horrified at the commando units suddenly proclaiming that they would bring death to their organic foes, the enemy army surrendered. Afterward, Vader sent his droids to help 0-0-0, BT-1, and Krrsantan capture Aphra. The Tech Masters used commando droids as guards.\n\nLater, Aphra was pursued by a monster droid bounty hunter, which was made from BX-series and B2 battle droid parts. The bounty hunter was destroyed during the skirmish on Arbiflux. The Commando droid ND-5, owned by the crime lord Jaylen Vrax, worked with Kay Vess in pulling off a heist on Sliro's Mansion. In 5 ABY, the Siniteen prison builder Golas Aram used several commando droids to guard his private compound on the planet Irudiru. The New Republic operatives Sinjir Rath Velus and Jas Emari fought and defeated several of Aram's droids with the help of the New Republic Special Forces soldier Jom Barell.\n\n",

        "content": "# BX-series droid commando - Battle of the Rishi Moon[]\n\nAround 22 BBY, Confederate General Grievous, the Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies, planned to invade the Wild Space planet of Kamino, where the Republic clone troopers were grown. In order to invade the planet unnoticed, Grievous sent several Droch-class boarding ships containing BX-series droid commandos to the moon of Rishi, where a Republic listening post, the Rishi Station was located. The clones stationed on the listening post identified the boarding ships as a meteor shower, and did not alert a nearby Republic fleet. The droids caught the deck officer, CT-327, by surprise, stunning and killing him. They then infiltrated the listening post, but were met by two clones, Droidbait and Nub, who had been sent by Sergeant O'Niner to find out why CT-327 did not reply. Upon hearing weapons fire, the remaining clones rushed to help, but were outnumbered by the commando droids. O'Niner/ was also killed by the commandos in the ensuing firefight. However, four clone troopers were able to escape the station through a ventilation shaft. The droids then secured the post and jammed the all-clear signal.\n\nThe droid commandos, however, were not aware that a routine inspection of the station conducted by Commander Cody and Captain Rex was on its way. Upon arriving in the Nu-class attack shuttle Obex, the two clone officers were greeted by a commando droid dressed in a clone armor. The droid tried to convince the clone troopers to leave the listening post; however, Rex saw a droid attack flare fired from the survivors. Realizing the trick, he shot the disguised droid through the head. The commando droids then launched an ambush, and after throwing grenades toward the clones and destroying shuttle, the droids believed that the two had died in the explosion. In fact, Cody and Rex had survived with the help of their harpoon cables. Meeting the survivors of the first droid assault below the station, the officers introduced themselves and a plot to retake the station was developed. Rex used a droid commando head to cheat the droids within the station to open the door. The clones then stormed the station, eventually regaining control of the control center after killing the commandos, including the droid captain. Despite reinforcements sent by General Grievous, the clone troopers blew up the station, cutting off the all-clear signal, thus alerting the Republic fleet of the planned Confederate invasion.\n\n",

        "content": "# BX-series droid commando - Characteristics[]\n\nThese battle droids appeared to be similar in general design to the B1-Series battle droid series, but with a noticeably different head shape and larger, white photoreceptors . Their voices were notably different compared to the B1 series, sounding more akin to the deep voices of B2 super battle droids. Unit leaders, which held the rank of captain, were fitted with white marks on their brows and chestplates and frequently wielded a vibrosword.\n\nThey had the same operating abilities as B1 battle droids, with the addition of infiltration software. This, along with their humanoid shape, allowed them to fit into a clone trooper's armor. In addition to this, the droids were capable of modulating their voices to match that of others, though they could not accurately copy their mannerisms or vocabulary, nor respond properly to unexpected situations outside of combat.\n\nThe droid commandos were built to be substantially faster and stronger than a regular battle droid, and also possessed heavier armor capable of withstanding multiple shots from most blasters. Sustained barrages or a single headshot could overwhelm them, but there are observed instances of bisected droids remaining semi-operable until dispatched by further damage, similar to super battle droids and IG-100 MagnaGuards; Eeth Koth cut a BX-series model in half, but it remained functional until Koth rendered it inoperable by piercing its head with his lightsaber. The head, generally, appears to have been a weak point; Senator Padme Amidala destroyed a BX with a headshot while wielding an ELG-3A royal blaster pistol, hardly bigger than a hold-out blaster. The only real drawback of these droids was that they were far more expensive to produce than the regular infantry. This made the droids a fairly rare sight on the battlefield, instead used almost exclusively on special operations missions and high importance tasks.\n\nThe BX-series commando droid wielded a variety of weapons, depending on the operation, including: E-5 blaster rifles, a stun baton, and a fusioncutter; additionally, the leader of a droid commando unit often carried a vibrosword for close-combat purposes. They were also known to use grenades against enemy emplacements. Demonstrating the variety of roles the type was utilized in, a two-droid team of BX droids were observed on Saleucami acting as a marksman team; one shooter with a sniper rifle and one spotter using electrobinoculars.\n\n",

Later in the battle, defective clone trooper Tup was abducted aboard a shuttle. Several droid commandos guarded Tup until Anakin Skywalker, CT-5555, and CT-7567 infiltrated Kraken's Maxillipede shuttle and destroyed the entire contingent.\n\n",

When the Galactic Republic came to liberate Kiros, a group of droid commandos on speeders ambushed a clone party led by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Ahsoka Tano. While the clones took some casualties, all the commandos were ultimately destroyed. Two units were also guarding the Separatist commander in-charge of the occupation, Darts D'Nar. However, they were also destroyed when Kenobi arrived.\n\n",
