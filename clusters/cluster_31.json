        "content": "# Porg - Behind the scenes[]\n\nPorgs were designed for the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. They were conceived by writer/director Rian Johnson, who created them to digitally cover up the vast numbers of real-life puffins present on Skellig Michael, the filming site for Ahch-To. According to creature concept designer Jake Lunt Davies, Johnson \"was looking at how can he work with [the puffins]. You can't remove them. You physically can't get rid of them. And digitally removing them is an issue and a lot of work, so let's just roll with it, play with it. And so I think he thought, 'Well, that's great, let's have our own indigenous species. Porgs were first revealed in behind-the-scenes footage from The Last Jedi at the D23 Expo in July 2017. They were officially named in a StarWars.com interview with Lucasfilm Story Group creative executive Pablo Hidalgo. Along with fellow Story Group member Leland Chee, Hidalgo rationalized that the birds seen flying on Ahch-To at the end of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens were also porgs, retroactively establishing that their first appearance was in that film.\n\nDuring the concept stage of The Last Jedi, creature designer Jake Lunt Davies explored a variety of influences, drawing ideas from birds, bats, flying squirrels, and aquatic creatures such as seals, otters, and beavers. The design approved by Johnson was based on a seal combined with a pug, akin to aquatic, flightless penguins. Porgs were created using a variety of effects including puppets and CGI. About fifteen porgs were built, each for a specific moment in the film, a group of painted models, animatronic pieces, and 1 \"hero\" model. The creatures' squawks were made using a manipulation of a combination of recordings of doves, chickens, and turkeys. The recordings were pitched to create the birds' unique sounds. Additionally, Skywalker Sound team member Ren Klyce sampled imitations of a turkey call performed by an intern named Nick Doctor to further develop the sound of the porgs. When ILM created the CG porgs, they took care to match the movements made by on-set puppeteers. Concept art for the film revealed that, in the scene where porgs investigate Skywalker's lightsaber, it was considered that one of them would have activated the weapon just as another was looking down the shaft, killing it.\n\nAt the theme park attraction Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, porg items are sold at the out-of-universe Creature Stall. Souvenir porg mugs are included with the purchase of a Cliff Dweller at Oga's Cantina.\n\n",

They could also run quite swiftly on the ground and were good at maneuvering into small spaces.\n\nPorgs were sexually dimorphic; males were slightly larger than females, and males also had orange plumage around the eyes. Their eyes had brown irises and black pupils with stereoscopic vision; their telescopic eyes helped them catch fish. Porgs of both sexes were covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. Their coloration gave them strong natural camouflaging abilities. They were much lighter than they looked, thanks to a thick outer layer of waterproof feathers with a fluffy underlayer for warmth, and they favored colder environments.\n\nPorgs apparently understood certain linguistic terms. When they overheard Rey refer to Chewbacca as \"Chewie,\" they mistook it to be the word chewy, leading them to wonder whether Chewbacca would serve as her food.\n\n",

Porgs exhibited a roosting behavior and built nests along the island cliffs. They would collect soft things to make nests and were drawn to shiny objects. The nests were made using hair, fiber, or grass, and decorated with shiny objects they had acquired. The mother and father tended to the nest. Porgs were capable of performing controlled dives into the sea, where they fetched fish to feed on or pass on to their otherwise-helpless offspring; they also hunted crustaceans.\n\nPorgs loved water, both to drink and to play in, and they also loved tasting new things. Both wild and domesticated porgs were unusually smitten by human objects. They were also fascinated by shiny objects. If their curiosity ran unchecked, they could wreak havoc. Their calls ranged from burbles to squeaks to song. They crooned a special song when they were pleased. Despite their curious nature, they could be completely silent when necessary and could be shy if they felt threatened. Porgs enjoyed being petted and scratched, especially behind their ears. A group of porgs was called a \"murder.\"\n\n",

Situated along the Nanth'ri Trade Route, it was the homeworld of several intelligent species, including the Mimbanese. For many decades, Mimban was the site of conflict between its natives and mining interests attracted by the planet's deep hyperbaride mineral deposits.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Mud Jumpers of the Grand Army of the Republic's 224th Division helped the Mimbanese Liberation Army repel the invading Separatist Droid Army. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, the 224th returned to Mimban as part of the Imperial Army to subjugate the Mimbanese and ensure Imperial energy mining operations continued unabated, which put them into conflict with their erstwhile allies.\n\n",

Originally created as the Bog Planet in the earliest scripts of the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, it first appeared in Splinter of the Mind's Eye, a 1978 Star Wars Legends novel written by Alan Dean Foster. Concepts for Mimban were later reused for Dagobah in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nEarly concept art for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story used Mimban as a setting, before Jedha was developed to replace it. The planet appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story. For a time in the movie's production, it was considered to make Mimban a planet with an aquatic, swamp-like surface. According to script writer Jon Kasdan, the film's crew wanted to evoke Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film Paths of Glory and put Han Solo into the most hellish-possible war environment.\n\n",

        "content": "# Porg - Behind the scenes[]\n\nPorgs were designed for the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. They were conceived by writer/director Rian Johnson, who created them to digitally cover up the vast numbers of real-life puffins present on Skellig Michael, the filming site for Ahch-To. According to creature concept designer Jake Lunt Davies, Johnson \"was looking at how can he work with [the puffins]. You can't remove them. You physically can't get rid of them. And digitally removing them is an issue and a lot of work, so let's just roll with it, play with it. And so I think he thought, 'Well, that's great, let's have our own indigenous species. Porgs were first revealed in behind-the-scenes footage from The Last Jedi at the D23 Expo in July 2017. They were officially named in a StarWars.com interview with Lucasfilm Story Group creative executive Pablo Hidalgo. Along with fellow Story Group member Leland Chee, Hidalgo rationalized that the birds seen flying on Ahch-To at the end of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens were also porgs, retroactively establishing that their first appearance was in that film.\n\nDuring the concept stage of The Last Jedi, creature designer Jake Lunt Davies explored a variety of influences, drawing ideas from birds, bats, flying squirrels, and aquatic creatures such as seals, otters, and beavers. The design approved by Johnson was based on a seal combined with a pug, akin to aquatic, flightless penguins. Porgs were created using a variety of effects including puppets and CGI. About fifteen porgs were built, each for a specific moment in the film, a group of painted models, animatronic pieces, and 1 \"hero\" model. The creatures' squawks were made using a manipulation of a combination of recordings of doves, chickens, and turkeys. The recordings were pitched to create the birds' unique sounds. Additionally, Skywalker Sound team member Ren Klyce sampled imitations of a turkey call performed by an intern named Nick Doctor to further develop the sound of the porgs. When ILM created the CG porgs, they took care to match the movements made by on-set puppeteers. Concept art for the film revealed that, in the scene where porgs investigate Skywalker's lightsaber, it was considered that one of them would have activated the weapon just as another was looking down the shaft, killing it.\n\nAt the theme park attraction Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, porg items are sold at the out-of-universe Creature Stall. Souvenir porg mugs are included with the purchase of a Cliff Dweller at Oga's Cantina.\n\n",

They could also run quite swiftly on the ground and were good at maneuvering into small spaces.\n\nPorgs were sexually dimorphic; males were slightly larger than females, and males also had orange plumage around the eyes. Their eyes had brown irises and black pupils with stereoscopic vision; their telescopic eyes helped them catch fish. Porgs of both sexes were covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. Their coloration gave them strong natural camouflaging abilities. They were much lighter than they looked, thanks to a thick outer layer of waterproof feathers with a fluffy underlayer for warmth, and they favored colder environments.\n\nPorgs apparently understood certain linguistic terms. When they overheard Rey refer to Chewbacca as \"Chewie,\" they mistook it to be the word chewy, leading them to wonder whether Chewbacca would serve as her food.\n\n",

        "content": "# Porg - Behavior[]\n\nThe hypercurious, cliff-dwelling creatures were found throughout the islands of the planet Ahch-To. Their young, called \"porglets,\" were hatched as pairs. Porgs exhibited a roosting behavior and built nests along the island cliffs. They would collect soft things to make nests and were drawn to shiny objects. The nests were made using hair, fiber, or grass, and decorated with shiny objects they had acquired. The mother and father tended to the nest. Porgs were capable of performing controlled dives into the sea, where they fetched fish to feed on or pass on to their otherwise-helpless offspring; they also hunted crustaceans.\n\nPorgs loved water, both to drink and to play in, and they also loved tasting new things. Both wild and domesticated porgs were unusually smitten by human objects. They were also fascinated by shiny objects. If their curiosity ran unchecked, they could wreak havoc. Their calls ranged from burbles to squeaks to song. They crooned a special song when they were pleased. Despite their curious nature, they could be completely silent when necessary and could be shy if they felt threatened. Porgs enjoyed being petted and scratched, especially behind their ears. A group of porgs was called a \"murder.\"\n\n",

The addition of the extra appendages required a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings were able to store food and water for many days, and if the need arose, they could survive for long periods without either. Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.\n\nA monogamous species, Besalisks chose a mate for life and often bore one or two eggs. Mating rituals were violent and highly competitive, taking place during the warmer months at specified conclaves. Besalisks were hatched from eggs, carried by the females which laid their young during warm seasons. Before the eggs hatched, a male Besalisk would store the egg close to their body under a large brood patch in his abdominal skin. Because of the chill of Ojom, Besaliks were equipped to survive in harsh conditions, causing them to sweat profusely when on planets with a warmer climate.\n\nChatty, quick to form lasting friendships and lovers of adventure, Besalisks often were fearless and sought thrills without care for themselves. This often caused trouble amongst their employers; Besalisks were known to walk off the job when bored with it and never return. When Besalisks did take jobs in the underworld, they were prone to gossiping and being loose-lipped. This unfortunate habit led to members of the species attracting more bounties than any other.\n\n",

Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The Bith's internal systems were different from most humanoids, as the Bith had only one lung, and exhaled through their skin. Bith also lacked a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin flaps of their cheeks.\n\nThe other Bith senses were also acute. Bith could sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other races sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, were able to focus to 0.07 on the Gandok Scale, and they could see microscopic details of nearby objects, but were extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors was the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It was described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, Bith had high manual dexterity, which helped them manipulate fine tools, though their prowess with gross motor skills was only average.\n\nBith had evolved past the need for sleep. Instead, they would slip into a light meditative trance, which allowed them to get as much rest in four hours as other species could get in eight. During this trance, Bith were still almost fully aware of their surroundings.\n\nA Bith's reproductive organs atrophied over time, as did the portions of their brain governing such impulses. As such, Bith were unable to reproduce naturally, instead relying on artificial conception and gestation. Mates brought genetic material to a Computer Mating Service for analysis against prospective mates. Bith children were created from genetic material from two parents, which was combined, fertilized, and incubated for a year.\n\n",
