The Droid Technician made their way towards the cargo hold, where they received a call from Mubo on their DataGrip. Mubo told them what to do, and the Droid Tech went to the cargo hold to scan all the cargo, and received a Hoverpack When finished, the cargo was marked done, and a ship was signaled to pick it up, but it exploded due to blaster fire from a Guavian Ship. The Guavians subsequently boarded the freighter, and the droid tech went to find a blaster, and used it to shoot guavian death gang hellions and Hunters. The droid tech won the blaster fight, and received a message from the Guavians Leader Tara Rashin, who told them that the first order was paying lots of money for a piece of cargo Mubo was smuggling, and told the droid tech to stand down and surrender. Tara also shot J-4X. The droid tech fought a few more guavian death gang members, and was told by Mubo to jettison the cargo, so they did that, and then made their way to the escape pods.

        "content": "# Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge - Working for Mubo[]\n\nIn the year 34aby an Unidentified droid repair technician woke up on Mubo's Cargo Tansport. The droid tech was greeted by a droid named J-4X, who told them to get to work in the cargo hold. The Droid Technician made their way towards the cargo hold, where they received a call from Mubo on their DataGrip. Mubo told them what to do, and the Droid Tech went to the cargo hold to scan all the cargo, and received a Hoverpack When finished, the cargo was marked done, and a ship was signaled to pick it up, but it exploded due to blaster fire from a Guavian Ship. The Guavians subsequently boarded the freighter, and the droid tech went to find a blaster, and used it to shoot guavian death gang hellions and Hunters. The droid tech won the blaster fight, and received a message from the Guavians Leader Tara Rashin, who told them that the first order was paying lots of money for a piece of cargo Mubo was smuggling, and told the droid tech to stand down and surrender. Tara also shot J-4X. The droid tech fought a few more guavian death gang members, and was told by Mubo to jettison the cargo, so they did that, and then made their way to the escape pods. After shooting more Guavians they escaped from the ship, and landed on Batuu.\n\n",

They and the rest of Kareen's crew agreed with San Maxus to start helping the Separatists and Count Dooku in order to make enough money to retire from podracing all together. While working on Mon Gazza the Niktos aided Maxus and the other mechanics in fending off the undercover Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, as Skywalker had been snooping around Kidd Kareen's pit looking for Separatist contraband. Kareen arrived shortly after the fight began and broke it up. Later Skywalker again confronted Maxus as he was making a pitstop during the Mon Gazza Maze, in attempt to grab Republic intel from Maxus who was going to sell it to Asajj Ventress. Maxus escaped, leaving Skywalker to face the Niktos and the rest of the crew yet again. Anakin was able to dispatch some of the mechanics with debris, including one of the Niktos, but left to pursue his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was podracing. This left the clone trooper Rex and the droid R2-D2 to fend off the remaining mechanics and Nikto. Later, Kareen indicated that after it all only Maxus had been retired from the crew after being killed by Ahsoka Tano. Kareen in fact offered Tano to take a job as a replacement for Maxus, but Tano refused.\n\n",

        "content": "# Batuu Jedi temple meditation chamber - History[]\n\nAround 379 BBY, Jedi Padawan Rooper Nitani went to the chamber to meditate after she was unable to shake a feeling of anticipation. While meditating, she reached out with the Force, perceiving the life around her as glowing colors and sensing other Jedi in the temple, including Petrish Imglor, Evat Seth, and her Master, Silandra Sho. She then reached out further, and sensed a flock of skylar-birds, a herd of horned stoans, and the forests surrounding the temple, before losing her concentration.\n\nJust as Nitani was considering seeking counsel from her Master, Sho entered the room with the church droid P3-7A and explained that the anticipation Nitani was sensing was actually her own. When Nitani questioned her, Sho told her that it was now time for Nitani to undergo her Jedi Trials to become a Jedi Knight. Sho explained that she had hidden her shield, which Nitani would have to find, and also told her to take P3-7A with her, although the droid knew nothing about the shield's location. Nitani then left the room with P3-7A to begin searching.\n\nAfter Nitani found the shield, she returned to the meditation chamber, where Sho was waiting. Nitani told her about what had happened during her trials, and they agreed to talk to the Jedi Council the next day. As Sho left the room, Nitani attempted to return the shield to her, but Sho told her to keep it and explained that she wanted to honor the tradition of passing down the shield from Master to Padawan.\n\n",

The Laser Master's last words remained in Canonhaus' mind as his Imperial Star Destroyer traversed the Hoth asteroid belt as part of Death Squadron in 3 ABY, hoping that none of the asteroid fragments would penetrate his ship's deflector shields. However, during Canonhaus' holographic meeting with Darth Vader and other Death Squadron commanding officers, an asteroid flew into Canonhaus' Star Destroyer, obliterating its bridge and killing the officer.\n\n",
