Her band also comprised of two dancers, a Twi'lek named Mestral, and a Zabrak named O'choa Detera. Following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Alisia and her band played music and danced for the patrons of the cantina owned by a Twi'lek named Tiarsis in the Tansarii Point Station, a space station located near the planet of Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system. As part of the band, Alisia played the musical instrument known as the bandfill. The Twi'lek entertainer Mira T'rani enjoyed the performance of Alisia's band, which featured two popular songs from Tatooine played by Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, \"Mad About Me\" and \"Dune Sea Special\".\n\nAlisia and her band also divided their time at another space station in the Bright Jewel system known as Nova Orion Station. In addition to the music they played on Tansarii Point Station, Alisia and her band also played two other cover songs belonging to Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-Wailers, including a Huttese song named \"Lapti Nek\". Despite the band's skill at playing these songs, their lack of original material drew criticism from at least one Nova Orion Industries employee frequenting the cantina.\n\n",

At one point, Javi sampled the sound of vulture droids from the mountains, an excursion they said nearly led them to die ten times. The captured sounds were later layered over lofi Trandoshan funk, a sound that Javi said you had to hear to believe.\n\nAfter spending time on the planet, they believed that Koboh's faint heartbeat was special and that was what they had been looking for.

She was played by Bea Arthur, who was best-known at the time for her portrayal of the title character in the television series Maude. Arthur was friends with Ken and Mitzie Welch, the composers who had written the lyrics to the song \"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye,\" and so she was cast in the role. While her lengthy shoot was being filmed, Arthur had no inkling that she was participating in anything related to Star Wars. Ackmena's song has been noted as a high point of a program that, overall, was universally panned. For The Star Wars Holiday Special, costume designer Bob Mackie created concept artwork of Ackmena.\n\nAuthor Bonnie Burton has expressed her affection for Ackmena, citing the character's strength, intelligence, wit, and refusal to take guff from anyone as the driving forces behind her nostalgic love of The Star Wars Holiday Special. When Burton became an administrator of the StarWars.com forums, she chose a picture of Ackmena as her personal avatar. In an article that Burton wrote concerning hypothetical figures for Hasbro's now-defunct Unleashed line of action figures, Ackmena was one of the characters chosen. Pablo Hidalgo provided an illustration of the hypothetical Ackmena figure.\n\n",

While in her eighties, she was a member of Freedom Flight, an organization that directed its efforts towards freeing slaves throughout the galaxy. In addition to her other skills, Ackmena was considered an expert in the mixing of beverages.\n\nDuring the Imperial broadcast, Ackmena would constantly encourage her patrons to purchase and consume more of her drinks, and would not tolerate loitering. She would not stop and chat idly with her patrons, as she had no desire to leave customers waiting. When Krelman insisted on engaging her in a conversation, she would begin performing other tasks, only paying cursory attention. She ignored him until he came into physical contact with her. When the Imperial curfew was issued, Ackmena did not question the orders, but was dissatisfied with them.

        "content": "# Ackmena - Curfew[]\n\nShortly thereafter, an Imperial message was displayed on the cantina's viewscreen\u2014due to subversive activities, a curfew was to be placed on the Tatoo system, effective immediately. As a result, all of Ackmena's patrons were required by law to return to their homes, which was not an uncommon occurrence. Acting without delay, the bartender approached Barbarine and the Modal Nodes, a Bith band playing in the cantina that night. She asked Barbarine and his band to depart, perhaps forever, but this caused a considerable amount of discontent amongst both the musicians and the patrons. Relenting, Ackmena offered the band a round of complimentary drinks before departing, and had Tork collect their orders.\n\nAckmena continued her attempts to get her customers to depart, however. She approached a pair of Duros who were chatting animatedly and asked them politely to leave, but they ignored her. Growing frustrated, she began yelling, urging the cantina patrons to return to their homes, but they reacted violently by throwing things at her. Ackmena was outraged, but she stopped Tork from responding in kind. She quietly asked Zutmore and Kelbo to leave, citing the times in the past that she had loaned them money, but even they ignored her. Desperate for some support, she turned to the Rodian Bludlow, and the Sakiyan Thorp\u2014they offered her the same response as the others. As a last-ditch effort, she approached the Lutrillian Solomahal, but unlike the others, had never encountered him before in the cantina.\n\nThe situation reached fever pitch when the Devaronian Kardue'sai'Malloc entered the bar, and reacted to Ackmena's insistence that they were closed by drawing a blaster. The bartender urged Tork to stand down, and the Devaronian took a seat. Thorp then demanded another drink, banging his empty glass on the table. He was soon joined by the other patrons in his protest. Realizing that she could not control the situation, Ackmena conceded, and offered everyone in the cantina one more drink, compliments of the bar. They all agreed, and as Ackmena began serving the drinks, she broke, unbidden, into a rendition of \"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye,\" complemented by the Modal Nodes.\n\nAs Ackmena sang her song, the patrons gradually began to depart. When the Talz Caldera Righim left, Ackmena was approached by the Aqualish Teak Sidbam, who began to dance with her. Bludlow decided to join in, as did the Cathar Myhr Rho. Rho, however, grew overly amorous, and had to be ejected by Tork. While some of the customers had left, there were a significant number still seated, and so Ackmena took a new approach. She led a march around the cantina in time with the music, urging the customers to follow her. They did so, and she was able to lead them straight out the door, aided by Tork. When they were all gone, she bade goodbye to Barbarine and his band, Tork, and her diminutive assistant, before closing the doors to Chalmun's Cantina. When she turned back to the bar, Krelman was there, waiting with his flowers. Approaching him, she accepted the flowers, just as the Imperial broadcast of their activities stopped.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ackmena - Broadcast blues[]\n\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, Ackmena was tending the bar when footage was taken inside the cantina by the Imperial Council, and broadcast live to other systems, including the Kashyyyk system. As Tork ejected a patron from the cantina, Ackmena berated the Snivvian Zutmore for consuming his beverage too slowly, and suggested that he quicken his pace if he wanted to stay. She then went on to encourage Kelbo, a M'shento'su'Nikto who was reluctant to drink. Soon enough, she was approached by Krelman, who wanted to talk with her rather than drink. He arbitrarily ordered a drink, which Ackmena served, but she chose not to converse with the man\u2014she had other customers waiting.\n\nAckmena served the Ithorian Deneb Both next, but was then summoned back by Krelman, who had finished his drink and placed a flower in his cup for the bartender. Ackmena was flattered, and Krelman explained that he had been in the cantina previously. He had interpreted her parting words of \"Come back soon, I'll be waiting,\" as a personal, unique message to him, and he now believed that he was meant to be with her. Krelman ventured behind the bar, and embraced Ackmena, but she responded by explaining that he had misinterpreted her words. The bartender was able to persuade Krelman to return to his seat by giving him a complimentary drink, but still the man would not accept the fact that she was not interested in him. As another one of her patrons, Pons Limbic, departed, she uttered her usual farewell. Realizing his folly, Krelman ceased his advances towards Ackmena.\n\n",

They eventually formed their own troupe, and Chalmun allowed them to perform at the cantina, provided they turned a profit. The two of them would perform together, enjoying moderate success. Following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, she and Veekan made a stage hit out of the life-story of Luke Skywalker, a Tatooine native who became a hero in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Their production inspired Myhr Rho, a regular at the cantina, to start up a tour of Tatooine locations tied to Skywalker's exploits. Eventually, Ackmena and Veekan enjoyed enough success to move their production from Chalmun's Cantina to a more suitable venue.\n\nAfter achieving fame with her singing and becoming a Tatooine celebrity of sorts, Ackmena would nevertheless return to Chalmun's and tend the bar during the nightshift. By 44 ABY, she had joined Freedom Flight, an organization dedicated to freeing slaves throughout the galaxy. She met with the Bothan known as Blink, another member of the organization, in the cantina during one of her shifts to discuss a shipment of slaves that would be leaving the planet and earning their freedom. The conversation was watched by a male Human who was soon after killed by Blink and the young slave Kitaya Shuul. Blink then sent Shuul to inform Ackmena that the shipment would be delayed.\n\n",

She was a favorite amongst the patrons there, as she was more approachable than the daytime bartender, Wuher. Ackmena, realizing this, requested better hours from her employer, Chalmun, but the Wookiee initially refused, sparking a confrontation between the two that lasted for months. Even though Ackmena was better liked than Wuher, during her shifts she was aided by Tork, a bouncer. As entertainment, she would occasionally sing to her patrons.\n\nOne night, after the Battle of Yavin, Ackmena had to fend off the advances of the amorous Krelman. Later that night, the Galactic Empire imposed a curfew on all residents of the Tatoo system. Ackmena tried to get her patrons to leave, but was initially unsuccessful, until she broke into song. She later turned her amateur singing into profit, teaming up with fellow entertainer Cebann Veekan. Together, the two of them formed an acting troupe, and enjoyed success with a production based on the life of Alliance to Restore the Republic war hero, Luke Skywalker. By the year 44 ABY, Ackmena had joined Freedom Flight, an organization dedicated to freeing slaves throughout the galaxy.\n\n",

Javi appreciated how much of a dive Pyloon's was and commented with excitement on the establishment's wonky dynamics, weirder customers, and barely functioning refreshers.\n\nThey spent their time on the planet sampling its ambient sounds for their music. At one point, Javi sampled the sound of vulture droids from the mountains, an excursion they said nearly led them to die ten times. The captured sounds were later layered over lofi Trandoshan funk, a sound that Javi said you had to hear to believe.\n\nAfter spending time on the planet, they believed that Koboh's faint heartbeat was special and that was what they had been looking for.

Zutton later used his artistic talents to paint bounty hunters and eventually became one to better understand the subject matter.\n\nHe commonly spent his money from selling pieces of art on spice, and frequently visited the cantinas in Mos Eisley, such as Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. His paintings were often of friends and associates, such as at Jabba's Palace, or, possibly, of his targets. As well as being an artist, he was also an author and created stories of some of the frequent patrons in Chalmun's Cantina.\n\nZutton's work for Jabba Desilijic Tiure was motivated by the need to support and look after Takeel. His bounty hunting skills were well developed, and he had built up a reputation in the Outer Rim as an efficient, decent hunter, whom even his targets and law enforcement could respect.\n\nHe on one occasion destroyed Jabba's CZ-3 secretary droid.\n\nAfter the death of Jabba, Zutton left Tatooine with his brother to display a travelling art exhibit of his paintings. His portraits of Jabba and his entourage became extremely popular after news of the Hutt's death gained publicity.\n\n",

        "content": "# Zutton - Behind the scenes[]\n\nAlthough this character is apparently short, Kenner initially created an erroneous tall version of his action figure. \"Blue Snaggletooth\" is the informal name of this rare action figure from 1978. Released as part of the Sears \"Star Wars Cantina Adventure Set,\" as well as a Sears exclusive mail-in two-pack with Greedo, the Snaggletooth figure was intended to represent the character Zutton. However, the only reference Kenner used for the figure was a partial black-and-white photograph of the character. As a result, the Snaggletooth figure included wore a uniform erroneously painted blue, had long legs, and wore boots and gloves. All versions of Snaggletooth from 1979 onward, including later Sears releases of the cantina set, were corrected to the proper red color, with bare feet and hands and shorter legs.\n\nIn 2001, Hasbro produced a figure called Zutton, but the figure actually resembles Rachalt Hyst.\n\nIn the Insider #130 article \"The Unusual Suspects: Who's Who in Mos Eisley,\" there are discrepancies between the pictured Reegesk mask and that seen in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. The Ranat pictured in this issue of Insider may in fact be Nevar Yalnal; however, this has yet to be clarified. The confusion continues with both Takeel and Zutton reversed from their Decipher Customizable Card Game images. The Decipher cards show Zutton with a full head of hair, while in the Insider image he has patchy hair and a large hump. Decipher depicts Takeel with patchy hair and a large hump, but in the Insider image he has a full head of hair and a small hump. The identified images of Mosep Binneed and Tawss Khaa also differ from those used by Decipher.\n\n",

Forty years afterwards, the Corellian singer Crufeela, a Shani already in trouble due to her habit of eating endangered creatures, used the song in a galactic talent show as part of an attempted comeback after an endangered papdoo scandal. Not understanding that the song was satirical, Crufeela claimed to have written \"Corellia for Corellians\" herself in memory of the victims of a recent natural disaster on Corellia. However, the comeback attempt failed, as not only was the true authorship discovered, Crufeela was also revealed to not have performed the song, having lip-synched to a voice recording scammed out of a Naboo teenager who had been trying to make it big on the holos, which had subsequently been delivered to Crufeela for her use in the competition.\n\nAlthough he was not interested in pop culture, Jedi Padawan Reath Silas witnessed Crufeela's lip-synched performance of \"Corellia for Corellians\" on the talent show, having also overheard the news about the singer from other Padawans who kept abreast of such things. He did not think the song was very good. Around 230 BBY, bodyguard Alys Ongwa, head of Supreme Coronet City Diplomat Protection, heard that Crufeela had been hired as the new performer for the Finance Ball, and quipped to her rival Dizcaro, whom Crufeela had hired for protection, that the singer would have to learn how to lip-synch on the fly if someone tried to make a song request in the middle of her performance. Silas, who was working with Ongwa's agency to uncover Nihil influence on Corellia, thought about the incident involving \"Corellia for Corellians\" while helping to execute a sting operation on Crufeela intended to get her arrested so they could replace her with a new performer, Mz. Z. When Crufeela was arrested for trying to eat the Bonbrak Teetak, Chief Inspector Deemus Abrus described it as her third fall from grace, after \"Corellia for Corellians\" and the papdoo scandal.\n\n",

Ralorsa and the others then resumed their song, but were soon interrupted again when many of the castle's residents rushed out to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon.

However, Dryden Vos was able to book her for an extended residency on his yacht by offering her a large sum of money. While performing on Vos' ship, she was paired with classic supper-club singer Luleo Primoc. In the months following the Clone War an advertisement for Ventafoli and Primoc could be seen on a rotating video billboard at the Safa Toma Speedway on Safa Toma. Ventafoli used a multi-vocoder to boost her voice to non-human frequencies and performed in a corded auropyle dress.\n\n",

On one occasion, after a scandal involving endangered papdoos, Crufeela attempted to make a comeback by performing the song \"Corellia for Corellians\" on a galactic talent show, but it was quickly discovered that she was lying about having written the song and had been lip-synching to a voice recording of a Naboo teenager. In 230 BBY, Crufeela was hired to perform at the Finance Ball after Svi'no Atchapat had to pull out. Atchapat's friend Alys Ongwa, the head of Supreme Coronet City Diplomat Protection, was working with the Jedi to uncover Nihil corruption in the Coronet City government, and set up a sting operation with Padawans Reath Silas and Ram Jomaram to entrap Crufeela with a meal from an endangered species, leading to her arrest by the Coronet City Chapter of the Galactic Society of Creature Enthusiasts.\n\n",

        "content": "# Sugaan Essena - Behind the scenes[]\n\nA segment of the song is first heard in the opening scenes of the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. It was created by Mongolian band The Hu, and performed in an original Star Wars language specifically for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The language was devised, with guidance from the game creators, by The Hu, who took inspiration from the power of Eternal Blue Sky and its relation to power in Star Wars, while incorporating other aspects of Mongolian culture into their band's style.\n\n\"Sugaan Essena\" means \"The Black Thunder.\" The song is about a warrior's heart and spirit as the power of thunder, a quality that Cal Kestis possesses.\n\nOn February 18, 2020, Electronic Arts released a music video on YouTube that featured the band performing an extended cut of the song not featured in the game.\n\nOn February 2, 2022, the band released their sophomore album \"Rumble of Thunder\" which includes a Mongolian version of the song, named \"Black Thunder\". An additional version with added lyrics in English\u2014featuring Serj Tankian and Daniel \"DL\" Laskiewicz from the band Bad Wolves\u2014was released on March 30, 2023.\n\nIn the 2023 video game Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the song is purchasable at Doma Dendra's shop in Rambler's Reach Outpost on Koboh, costing players three priorite. If players have recruited Ashe Javi and DD-EC, they can then play the song in Pyloon's Saloon.\n\n",

While the four performed, Kanata spotted the smuggler Han Solo entering the establishment, and yelled to him, causing the band to fall silent. They then resumed their playing, but were soon disturbed again when many of the castle's residents rushed out to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon.

Within Jedi: Survivor itself, each artist was credited as an in-universe musician. Featured artists in Sounds from the Galactic Skylanes included the American indie rock band Joywave, performing as the in-universe group Yubnib Zekk and the Main Characters; the Tel Aviv-based instrumental trio TATRAN, performing as NAAARTAAAT, \"TATRAN\" spelled backwards with extra A's; the Turkish psychedelic rock band Alt\u0131n G\u00fcn, who performed under the tongue-in-cheek pseudonym Altin Lazer Blaster; the Floridian multi-instrumentalist music producer Kaelin Ellis, whose in-universe persona Mister Mockwell was a different stylization of his previous out-of-universe pseudonym, Mr. Mockwell; and the popular Mongolian folk metal band The HU, who reprised their role from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order as the in-universe band The Agasar.\n\n",

She emigrated to the planet Naboo, where she oversaw a group of musicians known as Melodic Order. Pareece and the musicians worked in Club Deeja, a club in the city of Keren, where Melodic Order had no contact with non-Alderaanians. The group's cloister vow was to preserve the cultural integrity of their music, so they performed via hologram but maintained in-person contact with Pareece. After the Galactic Empire destroyed Alderaan, Pareece kept the event hidden from Melodic Order so they would continue to perform. Mul Sanaka, the owner of Club Deeja, agreed with her approach in order to protect the profits and enjoyment generated by the club's customers.\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Princess Leia Organa\u2014the last surviving member of the ruling family of Alderaan\u2014set out on a mission to rescue all of the Alderaanians who still lived after Alderaan's destruction, as the Empire was hunting down all of the survivors. Organa traveled to Naboo to find Melodic Order. She arrived at the club, where she identified herself as First Minister Solo of the Empire. She was confronted by Sanaka, however, who knew her true identity and purpose on Naboo. Sanaka and his guards tried to attack Organa, but Organa and her companions, Evaan Verlaine and the astromech droid R2-D2, fought them off. Sanaka nearly killed Organa, but Pareece intervened and knocked Sanaka unconscious using the stun setting on her Satine's Lament blaster pistol.\n\nPareece told Organa how she had concealed the truth from Melodic Order, before gathering the musicians together to tell them what happened. The princess urged the group not to cast blame on Pareece, but to instead join her in order to save their fellow Alderaanians. Pareece and the Melodic Order agreed to join, and they set out for the planet volcanic planet Sullust in the Outer Rim to find more survivors.\n\n",

Greedo, a bounty hunter hired by Trade Federation official Sib Canay, kidnapped Che Amanwe Papanoida, the daughter of Pantoran Supreme Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida, and held her captive in one of the cantina's back rooms. When Greedo was forced by Jabba to lead the Chairman Papanoida and his son Ion to the cantina, a firefight broke out in the bar between the three Pantorans and Greedo's associates.\n\nAround the time of the Battle of Kadavo during the Clone Wars, two Alderaanian tourists visiting Tatooine died in a speeder bike accident. The Zygerrian News implied that the two had gotten intoxicated in the cantina of Mos Eisley, thereby causing the accident.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Dathomir, Asajj Ventress made her way to the Mos Eisley cantina, where she began to drown her sorrows with prow. One of the patrons, a bounty hunter named Oked, made a pass at her, and when he refused to relent, was killed by Ventress. Two other bounty hunters, Bossk and Latts Razzi, coerced Ventress into joining their job in Oked's place.\n\nSoon after, Ventress and Razzi were in the cantina when Ventress felt a disturbance in the Force, that disturbance being Savage Opress coming closer to locating his brother, Maul.\n\nOnce Opress had found Maul, the two began a killing spree in order to draw out Maul's nemesis Obi-Wan Kenobi. Opress appeared on a screen displaying open bounties, prompting Ventress to take the job in an attempt to take down her former underling.\n\nFollowing the mission to Raxus Secundus, Ventress returned to Tatooine to enlist Boba Fett's Syndicate to help her rescue Jedi Master Quinlan Vos from Serenno. She met with Boba Fett in the cantina, and after some debating, the two joined forces to free Vos.\n\n",

        "content": "# Music\n\nThroughout the galaxy, beings created and listened to the art form known as music.\n\nBands were groups of musicians who performed music, often before audiences in social settings such as cantinas, or as private entertainment. Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes was a Bith band, notable for performing the song \"Mad About Me\" in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina and the Max Rebo Band performed songs including \"Jedi Rocks\" in the palace of Jabba the Hutt. Many bars and cantinas played music to entertain the patrons. This included Oga's Cantina on Batuu that had constant music played by reprogrammed RX-Series pilot droid R-3X.\n\nAn opera was a dramatic work set to music and including songs. Such works were performed in theaters called opera houses and attending operas was regarded as a cultured activity. During the last decades of the Galactic Republic, many politicians and other wealthy citizens of Coruscant often took in operatic performances at the Galaxies Opera House and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine maintained a private viewing box which had a premier view of the performance. Music schools, such as the Theed Conservatory on Naboo, taught students about music. Sab\u00e9, like her older brothers before her, attended the Theed Conservatory, before becoming a handmaiden to Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, where she played the hallikset. Some repressive governments, such as the Galactic Empire, suppressed certain types of music, such as political protest songs like \"Vader's Many Prosthetic Parts\" by Hakko Drazlip and the Tootle Froots. The Empire also routinely raided and closed music venues due to violating artistic standards set by the Galactic Empire's Coalition for Progress.\n\nDuring the High Republic era, the Nihil would broadcast music before and during attacks, both to stir up their own battle frenzy and to cause confusion among those they were attacking. One genre of music they preferred was known as wreckpunk. During one encounter with the Nihil, the crew of The Vessel played a song known as the margengai glide over a multi-frequency broadcast in order to disrupt communications between Nihil ships. The jaunty, fast song had been a popular dance tune for at least the previous few decades. Along with the margengai glide, Vessel pilot Leox Gyasi loved other music, such as Chandrilan opera. He traded music files with Joss and Pikka Adren after discovering that they were fans of the same simjo band.\n\nCorellia was the origin of a type of music called Galan-Kalank, which arose from the songs of shipyard workers. It was popularized in the galaxy by the Atchapat Family Galan-Kalank Orchestra, who toured with portable instruments constructed from machine parts. Cal Kestis liked to listen to music like \"Sugaan Essena\" by the band The Agasar. Upon entering the Haxion Fight Pit arena on Ordo Eris, Cal Kestis recognized them playing the song. Sabine Wren enjoyed listening to music such as quenk jazz. Gonkrock was a type of loud and aggressive music enjoyed by Rieve. Prior to becoming a Hunter in the Grand Arena on Vespaara, she played in a gonkrock band named Corellia's Not Dead. Jatz was a type of music that was expectantly played at Suli's cantina. New Republic pilot Chass na Chadic had a collection of music, including glimmik, deva, Herglic rage-metal, and Warbat trance, which she enjoyed listening to during battles. Alderaan had a song, known as a lullaby, called Mirrorbright, which mentioned a moon despite Alderaan not having one. Music boxes, such as one that was kept in Leia Organa's keepsake chest, played music when opened. The grandmother of Carise Sindian used to sing the song when she was feeling nostalgic for her homeworld.\n\nThe song \"Niamos!\" was an popular song with remixes by 4 BBY.\n\n",

An aspiring musician, the teenager made a voice recording of the satirical song \"Corellia for Corellians\" while trying to find stardom on the holos. However, she was scammed out of her recording, which the Corellian singer Crufeela lip-synched to in an attempted comeback performance on a galactic talent show. Crufeela's comeback however, failed when it was discovered both that the teenager was the real singer, and that she had also lied about writing the song, which had actually been penned by an Alderaanian forty years prior.\n\n",

They once performed it for the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure at his palace on the planet Tatooine. The song's lyrics, which were improvised on the spot by singer Sy Snootles, were so saucy that they embarrassed the prudish Bib Fortuna, and would likely have been officially banned by the Galactic Empire. The protocol droid C-3PO, who was also present during the musical number, was bewildered by Snootles' blatant misuse of several verbs. The song was interrupted when Jabba, in a fit of anger, fed the Twi'lek dancer Oola to his pet rancor Pateesa, just moments before Rebel Alliance general Leia Organa, disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, entered the palace with the Wookiee Chewbacca as a prisoner.\n\n",

As relatives of Jabba, the Twins laid claim to his former territories, and traveled to the city of Mos Espa to confront Fett. While the Hutts were carried on a platform by a litter of slaves, flanked by the Wookiee gladiator Krrsantan, the drummer marched at the vanguard, rhythmically beating his drums. The drum beating caught the attention of Fett while he was at the Sanctuary cantina, the rest of the patrons also noticing the sound.\n\nWith the drummer at the head, the Twins' group stopped before the sanctuary entrance, where Fett and his guard awaited. When the Twins' declared their claim to Jabba's territory, the drummer walked forward and took out a document for Fett to observe. Rejecting the Hutts' claim, Fett claimed they would have to kill him for the land. Not wanting to start a war, the Twins chose to depart for the time being. The drummer began beating his drum again, waiting for the Twins' litter carried platform to turn around before moving to the front and leaving with them.\n\nThe Twins sent Krrsantan to assassinate Fett, but the Wookiee failed and was captured as a result. On top of that, the Hutts chose to leave Tatooine after finding out that Mayor Mok Shaiz of Mos Espa had sided with another syndicate, the Pyke Syndicate. The drummer joined the Twins and their litter in visiting the Fett's palace, formerly Jabba's palace. The man then stood there while the Hutts apologized to the Daimyo for the assassination attempt by giving him a rancor and informed him of their departure due to the arrival of another syndicate. Once finished, the Twins' litter began carrying them away, the drummer moving to their front and preparing to beat his drums.\n\n",

D'an favored the Kloo horn, although could also play a mean Gasan string drum. He proved overbearing and compulsive to his band-mates, although the Modal Nodes earned a reputable standing in the music industry, and achieved reasonable success on the galactic circuit. However, the band largely remained an entertainment feature on the Outer Rim Territories, theorized to be due to the lack of vocals in their tracks. In particular, they became a popular fixture at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley on Tatooine, where patrons preferred D'an's work on the Gasan string drum over his usual Kloo horn. D'an used the earnings from the band's success to gamble without the rest of the band's knowledge, favoring cheating at cards.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, D'an and the Modal Nodes played their most recognizable tune \"Mad About Me\" on stage in Chalmun's cantina, although their performance was interrupted by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi slicing off the arm of the Aqualish Ponda Baba in defense of the young farmboy Luke Skywalker. Once the incident was over, the band began playing again as the cantina's patrons returned to their drinks.\n\n",

Some time later, Fett was attacked and was injured by the Order of the Night Wind, which was later revealed to have been sent by Jabba's cousins, the Twins, who wanted to acquire the territory that formerly belonged to their deceased cousin.\n\nThe Twins sent Krrsantan to kill Lord Fett at his palace. After Krrsantan's failure and capture, they arrived to apologize to Fett and offer him a rancor as tribute. They also announced their departure from Tatooine, as they've been informed that Jabba's former holdings have actually been promised to the Pyke Syndicate by Mayor Mok Shaiz, and they had no interest in starting a war over a \"worthless rock\". With a war with the Pyke Syndicate on the horizon, Fett began assembling an army, recruiting even Krrsantan despite his attempt on his life and Djarin. Although Krrsantan and Djarin joined the fight against the Pykes, Fett still needed a infantry as the Pykes outnumbered them. Djarin offered to help with this. He went to Freetown, the town formerly known as Mos Pelgo, to enlist the help of his acquaintance, Sheriff Cobb Vanth. Djarin asked that he and the townspeople join Fett, saying that the Pykes' influence would inevitably reach the town as well. Though Djarin didn't know it, Vanth had already faced the Pykes when he saw them trading spices in the city's territory.\n\nHowever, Vanth initially saw no reason for people to join the fight, as he thought the Pykes wouldn't mind Freetown, at least not with him around. Djarin left, but Vanth said he'd think about it. Shortly after Djarin's departure, Vanth decided to recruit those in the city who were willing to fight. At this time, the famous bounty hunter Cad Bane, who was in the employ of the Pykes, arrived in the city. Bane had gone to deal with Vanth for his meddling in syndicate affairs. After a brief conversation and Vanth refusing to let the Pykes continue with the spice trade in the city, Bane wounded Vanth and killed his assistant before clearing things up for the citizens and departing. After a battle in the streets of Mos Espa, which led to Bane's death at the hands of Fett, many damages in the city and many losses to the Pykes, the syndicate withdrew from incorporating Tatooine into their territory. With Fett having fought within the city to defend it and winning the day, he became respected by the people he ruled over.\n\n",

There, she urged her people to continue fighting before she was quickly killed on stage in front of the crowd. Her death inspired the Drabatans to rise up against the Empire.\n\n",

        "content": "# Tatooine - New days ahead[]\n\nFollowing the creasing of Imperial rule, numerous crime syndicates attempted to build legitimacy as mining companies, with one such company, the Red Key Raiders, afraid that the New Republic would eventually stamp out their operations on the planet. These companies tried to take advantage of the power vacuum caused by the death of Jabba. However Fett lived on, having only been knocked unconscious for an unknown length of time, and dug himself out of the great pit. Exahusted and suffering wounds from the enounter, collapsed, where a Jawa sandcrawler scavenged the wreckage from Jabba's sail barge, including his set of Mandalorian armor. The enigmatic lawman Cobb Vanth then obtained Boba Fett's armor from the Jawa sandcrawler and went on to defeat the Red Key gangster Adwin Charu.\n\nBy 5 ABY, Vanth had become the mayor and Sheriff of Mos Pelgo and dedicated his life to protecting the town from the Red Key Raiders. He also enlisted Jabba's former Beastmaster Malakili in helping to tame two unruly rontos and to raise the Huttlet named Borgo. With Malakili's help, Cobb struck a deal with the local Tusken Raiders to protect the town in exchange for water and receiving a pearl from the stomach of a krayt dragon. This alliance proved important in repelling an attack by the Red Key syndicate led by Lorgan Movellan.\n\nIn 9 ABY, the bounty hunter Din Djarin defeated a pursuing bounty hunter in a dogfight. His ship, the Razor Crest was damaged and he landed at a repair facility run by Peli Motto in Mos Eisley. While seeking work to pay for the repairs in a local cantina, he met Toro Calican, a young bounty hunter looking to join the guild by capturing Fennec Shand, a well-trained mercenary. Despite having misgivings, Djarin agreed to help him in exchange for the bounty's reward, while all other credit. Around this same time, Grogu, an infant member of Yoda's species traveling under the care of Djarin, exited the Razor Crest and attracted the attention of Peli Motto, who cared for him while repairing the ship for Djarin. Djarin and Calican then traveled into the Dune Sea on speeder bikes, looking for Shand. They came upon Tusken Raiders; Djarin bartered with them for safe passage. They eventually came across a Dewback with a dead bounty hunter attached to it, which is revealed to be bait laid out by Shand to attract anyone looking for her. The two managed to fend off Shand's attacks, but lost one of their speeder bikes in the process. Nevertheless, the pair was able to take Shand into custody.\n\nDjarin agreed to go retrieve the Dewback they encountered earlier to replace the destroyed speeder. Calican watched over Shand during this period. While alone, Shand told him that Mando was a traitor to the guild and that the bounty on him was worth a great deal more than her bounty. Calican was unconcerned with the bounty, but Shand pointed out that taking out a Mandalorian would make him a legend. She then offered to help Calican capture the Mandalorian if he set her free. However, Calican instead shot her, assuming that she would betray him, and then headed to the repair facility on the speeder bike, where he took Motto and Grogu hostage. Shortly thereafter, Djarin arrived and used a flash grenade to disorient Calican, using the opportunity to kill him. Mando then gave Calican's money to Motto to pay for the repairs on his ship. He and Grogu then left Tatooine.\n\nDjarin, through a lead given by Gor Koresh, would later return to Tatooine in search of other Mandalorians in his quest to find a Jedi. Upon his return, in place of another Mandalorian, he was instead met by the lawman Cobb Vanth donning Boba Fett's armor. After a tumultuous start, the two became allies and worked together to unite the local citizens of Mos Pelgo and nearby Tusken Raiders to liberate all from the terror of a leviathan krayt dragon. During this time, the bounty hunter Boba Fett began to track Din Djarin, watching him from a distance in the Tatooine desert. Joined by Shand, whose life he had saved after Calican shot her, Fett eventually regained his armor after following Djarin to the planet Tython.\n\n",

        "content": "# Jess - Biography[]\n\nJess played the seven-string hallikset and had a long-term relationship with a swooper named Altair Wyeto, who, in 2 ABY took his chance to join the swoop circuits and departed for the Core Worlds. Although Wyeto would have been willing to stay had she asked him, Jess told him to go and live his dream despite the fact that they would be apart. The two promised to see each other again.\n\nJess eventually became a performer and servant at Jabba's palace because her father, Willux, had a debt to Jabba the Hutt. She dreamed of killing the Hutt and escaping but believed she never would. Eventually, Wyeto returned and attempted to bargain with Jabba for her freedom. He later encountered Jess and asked her to marry him. Jess refused to try and escape, saying that Jabba's people would hunt them both down and kill them. When Wyeto insisted, Jess, overcome by sadness and anger, told him to leave and never come back.\n\nDuring her servitude, Jess befriended the singer Damaris Viell and Jabba's slave dancer Oola. She also caught the attention of Bib Fortuna, though she only made it look like she would reciprocate his affections. Having been relegated to serve drinks while the Max Rebo Band performed, Jess then sat next to Fortuna for Oola's final dance and subsequent death when Jabba dropped her into the rancor pit. Despite trying not to look directly into the pit, Jess was enraged as the rancor ate Oola.\n\nWhen Jabba captured Princess Leia Organa during her attempt to free the smuggler Han Solo from his carbonite prison, the Hutt ordered Jess and Damaris to prepare Organa to serve as his replacement for Oola. While she dressed Organa in a dancing-girl costume, she informed the Princess that if she didn't cause trouble, she would be treated well. Organa rejected her advice and insisted that Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker would soon arrive to save her. Later that night, Damaris had a vision that Organa's chains would not hold her, but when she refused to tell Organa, Jess expressed her frustration.\n\nThe next morning, Jess received a written message that a palace kitchen worker, Naatke, had found amongst arriving cargo and given to her. It was from her old neighbor, Imj, who told her that Willux had passed away. That same day, Skywalker visited the palace. He was eventually taken prisoner and, alongside Chewbacca and Solo, was sentenced to be executed in the Great Pit of Carkoon. Jess hid in the palace until Jabba's sail barge left for the pit so that she wouldn't have to go. She then stole a Joben T-85 speeder bike from the palace hangar and rode to Mos Espa, where she learned that Jabba had been killed. Locating Wyeto, the two escaped the planet together.\n\nWhen Organa was later briefed by the Rebellion chronicler Dora Mar, she told her about both Jess and Oola. Though they were not part of the Rebellion, Organa insisted that they were important to the story and should be included in the Rebel's records. Organa admitted that she didn't know whether or not Jess had survived.\n\n",

The Jedi, \"Nari,\" had escaped the Inquisitors originally, but was eventually found and killed. The inhabitants of the planet were surprised by the arrival of the Inquisitors, since Tatooine was not part of the Galactic Empire, and for this reason the Inquisitorius did not have jurisdiction on the planet, but this by no means prevent them to operating. Later, Bail Organa shows up on Tatooine looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi's help in finding his daughter, Leia Organa. The Third Sister eventually returns to Tatooine looking to murder Luke Skywalker. The Third Sister redeems herself and decided not to hurt Luke, and brings him back to his uncles.\n\nIn the years following Emperor Palpatine's formation of his New Order, the Great Drought of Tatooine scorched the world's surface, impoverishing the many moisture farmers of a reliable source of income to procure food and other basic supplies. The situation was not helped by Jabba's thugs collecting \"water taxes\" from the many towns and isolated settlements across the planet, often resorting to threats and brute force to acquire enough water for the crime lord. With Obi-Wan Kenobi witnessing the suffering of the population, he disabled the weapons of the thugs, allowing the populace to chase them off. Later, a young Luke Skywalker attempted to confront the thugs, but was ultimately rescued by Obi-Wan after falling unconscious in a brief scuffle. With the legacy of the Jedi safe, Obi-Wan vowed never to return to town, while a week later the drought finally ended, and Jabba vowed revenge on the man who had stolen his water, to no avail.\n\nThe Empire annexed Tatooine at one point but largely ignored the planet. All the same, the Empire left a small garrison on Tatooine. Additionally, the Empire's rise prompted the Hutts to revise their often times shady business schemes, resulting in a transfer of regional wealth and influence from Mos Espa to Mos Eisley, prompting the slow economic decline of Mos Espa.\n\nIn 2 BBY, the former Sith apprentice Maul traveled to Tatooine to hunt down his old nemesis Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unable to draw the Jedi Master out of hiding, Maul used the fragment of the Malachor Sith holocron to lure the Jedi rebel Ezra Bridger to the planet. Ezra traveled with the C1-series astromech droid Chopper to Tatooine. The two rebels were attacked by Tusken Raiders, who damaged their RZ-1T trainer. After being lost in the desert, Ezra and Chopper were rescued by Kenobi, who revealed Maul's deception. Kenobi then instructed the two rebels to return to Atollon while he defeated and fatally wounded Maul in combat. As Maul died in Kenobi's arms, Kenobi confirmed Maul's suspicions that he was hiding the Chosen One.\n\n",

They traveled to Tatooine to recruit Klam, who was sitting atop Gurtyl in a town among several other residents, though Klam ultimately did not accompany them when they traveled to a Rebel Rendezvous to recruit Magna Tolvan.\n\nKitster Banai and Wald returned to Tatooine to free their friends, Melee, Amee, and Seek on a moisture farm on Tatooine. The two sold the owner an energy capsule that they had stolen from the Galactic Empire and gave the money to free all the enslaved workers there. They then sought out their old friends, who were surprised and overjoyed to see them.\n\nAttempting to rescue Solo, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO infiltrated Jabba's Palace disguised as servants after Luke Skywalker \"gifted\" them to the crime lord. Arriving at the palace not long after, Skywalker attempted to bargain with Jabba for his friend's life, only to be refused and dropped into a rancor pit. After a struggle, Luke managed to kill the rancor, angering Jabba and sentencing him and Solo (who was freed by Organa in the guise of a bounty hunter who had captured his friend, Chewbacca) to death in the Great Pit of Carkoon, while Organa became one of Jabba's many entertainers. Later, as they were about to be executed, R2-D2 fired Skywalker's lightsaber at him from Jabba's sail barge, allowing Skywalker, Solo, and Lando Calrissian, who had been disguised as a guard, to make their escape. After an intense shootout, Organa strangled Jabba to death with the chain used to keep her hostage, and Boba Fett was knocked into the sarlacc. Skywalker, Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, Calrissian, and the two droids escaped the planet once more. Although Fett was swallowed by the sarlacc, he survived and managed to escape the creature's stomach, though his armor was stolen by Jawas shortly thereafter due to his weakness from his escape.",

At one point, the group was hired by Jabba the Hutt to stay at his palace on the planet Tatooine. Their number would eventually grow, adding drummers such as Ak-rev and Umpass-stay, and vocalists such as Joh Yowza. One of their greatest hits, \"Lapti Nek,\" was one of Jabba's favorites.\n\nAround four years after the Battle of Yavin, the band played the song \"Jedi Rocks\" for the Hutt and his court, which Jabba demanded be played again. During the second performance, however, Jabba interrupted the band by dropping his slave dancer Oola into the rancor pit below his throne room, where she was devoured. The band was shocked to witness this, and also a bit annoyed about being interrupted. The band then witnessed Leia Organa enter the palace disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh and claim the bounty on the Wookiee Chewbacca. When Organa later freed the smuggler Han Solo from carbonite, several members of the band were present with Jabba in hiding. The band then traveled on board Jabba's sail barge to the Great Pit of Carkoon, surviving the explosion and breaking up afterward.\n\n",

The negotiations concluded with Jabba agreeing to provide the Imperial war machine with whatever resources it required. Jabba requested only that the Emperor pay him well, to which Vader said that the Empire would pay him whatever they felt was appropriate. Additionally, as long as Jabba complied with Imperial demands, the Empire would allow Jabba to continue operating his criminal empire. Jabba convinced Vader to briefly stay on Tatooine for a feast and entertainment in the Sith Lord's honor, and the entertainment proved to be the hunting of wild bantha. Jabba hosted the Sith Lord on his sail barge, where Jabba inquired as to whether the two bounty hunters had proven themselves useful thus far. Vader stated that their missions would be simple enough: capture an Imperial agent working for the Emperor, and locate the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. Vader also demanded to know everything that Jabba knew about Obi-Wan Kenobi, who lived in exile on Tatooine for nearly two decades. Jabba told him only that Kenobi had proven to be a thorn in his side in those years.",

For Greedo's close-ups, a new articulated head was built for pickups at the end of the shoot, and Maria De Aragon was enlisted to play the Rodian. The mechanism for Greedo's mouth broke just before he needed to be shot. Aragon was then asked to put a clothespin between her teeth to move Greedo's mouth, making Greedo come to life. During pickups, Greedo's costume vest changes significantly, as do his hands. In the original shoot, Greedo has long, suction-cup tipped fingers, and in pickups, he has swollen knuckles and shorter fingers. The Greedo mask and tunic are currently on display as part of the \"Out of this World: Extraordinary Costumes from Film and Television\" in the Science Fiction Museum & Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington. Aragon claims that George Lucas practically saved her life when he saw her making odd gestures to signal that she couldn't breathe in the mask.\n\nGeorge Lucas called upon Ben Burtt to come up with a voice for Greedo, who at first was to speak with an electronic, insect-like voice. At first, Lucas and Burtt spoke \"oink\" on the microphone. The word \"oink\" was going to be manipulated with \"the right rhythm and electrical equipment\" to make a bizarre-sounding language, but they were unhappy with the result After going through mutliple languages, Burtt and Linguist Larry Ward, a UC Berkeley grad student created some \"fake Quechua\". Burtt was attracted to Quechua because of some comical repetitions and musicality of the language, but failed to find a native speaker to produce sound samples, so he utilized Ward's knowledge and skills. A combination of multiple languages paired with expert editing were used to create Greedo's voice. Ward provided the voice over, and it was Burtt's job to make the voice interesting. While Ward did provide little bits of Greedo's voice, Blake also provided some of words as well, which were later scrambled electronically, but none of their voice work was done at Elstree Studios. According to Blake, Greedo was just referred as \"The Alien\" in the script.\n\nThe recorded lines were edited so that they matched the masks's snout movements on the scene. Burtt then made Greedo's \"alien\" voice by using the \"comb filtering\" phasing effect; practically, each line had two identical loops, which, while being played back simultaneously, Burtt dragged his thumb on one of the reels, syncing them off a few milliseconds, and giving the voice a \"tubular quality\".\n\n",

According to M-6NK, Abel Drongite, the previous owner of the saloon, also ran a smuggling ring on the side. He gave the Bedlam Raiders a cut of the profits, but one day he shorted the marauders which was a mistake that cost him his life.\n\nIn 9 BBY, Turgle was attacked by Rayvis and the Bedlam Raiders in front of the saloon, but was saved by Cal Kestis, who had come to the planet in search of Dritus. Cal Kestis stayed in the private quarters under the saloon as a base of operations while on Koboh. During his time on Koboh, Kestis recruited several beings to set up in the saloon and attract further patrons. Those recruited include Ook and Mu, Stev, Javi and DD-EC, and Walde. These efforts boosted the popularity of the saloon until the increased presence of the Galactic Empire on Koboh changed the plans of many Rambler's Reach Outpost residents. Other regulars at Pyloon's Saloon included bounty hunter Caij Vanda, the droid ZN-A4, Mosey Cimmaron, Turgle, Bode Akuna, Toa, Moran, Tulakt, Zygg Soza, Wini Eres, Harr, Dana, and Grock. While Kestis sought the key to Tanalorr, a fabled planet inside the Koboh Abyss, the saloon was often defended from Bedlam Raider attacks by the Nightsister Merrin. At this time, the saloon was thriving and was busier than it had been for a long time. Once the Raiders had been defeated, many of the patrons decided to leave Koboh for pastures new, as the Empire had moved a Star Destroyer into orbit over the planet.\n\n",

        "content": "# Jabba Desilijic Tiure - Crime amid tyranny[]\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire, and the chancellor declared himself Emperor. Jabba continued his illicit operations during the Age of the Empire, continuing to hold influence as a crime lord. Around one year into the Empire's reign, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano decided against going to Jabba for help while avoiding the Imperial Military, deciding the Hutt would not help her despite her role in saving his son during the Clone Wars.\n\nDuring a particularly bad drought on Tatooine, Jabba began collecting a hefty water tax from local moisture farmers. This earned his thugs an unpleasant encounter with Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was watching and protecting a young Luke Skywalker. When Skywalker attempted to steal the thugs' collections for the day, they caught and threatened to kill him. It was at that moment that Kenobi took down the thugs with the Force. Under cover of darkness, the gangsters were unable to identify Kenobi. Most displeased with his loss of tax revenue, Jabba hired the Wookiee bounty hunter Krrsantan to track down and identify the former Jedi Master.\n\nStreet orphan and later rebel Jedi Ezra Bridger identified himself as \"Jabba\" whenever he wanted to keep his real name secret, for example to Imperial officers.\n\nIn 10 BBY, the scoundrel Tobias Beckett came into contact with Jabba and intended to travel to Tatooine to work for him once he decided to leave Crimson Dawn, but he was killed by Han Solo at Savareen before that could come to be. As such, Jabba hired Solo for his operations, who became the best smuggler on Jabba's payroll. Solo's standing was jeopardized, however, when his ship, the Millennium Falcon, was boarded by Imperial authorities, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo. Jabba demanded compensation for the lost cargo and, when Solo could not pay, the crime lord sent bounty hunters after him. One such hunter was Greedo, who confronted Solo in a cantina in Mos Eisley, but Solo killed the Rodian bounty hunter before he could kill Solo. Jabba learned of this and found Solo in Docking Bay 94, where the smuggler said that he had no choice but to dump his cargo. Jabba agreed to give Solo an extension on the payment in exchange for fifteen percent interest. Solo accepted the offer, but he soon became involved in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and once again failed to pay Jabba. When Jabba learned that Solo had joined the Rebellion, Jabba placed a large bounty on the smuggler's head.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, in which the Alliance\u2014with Solo's help\u2014destroyed the Imperial, planet-destroying battle station known as the Death Star, the Empire was left in dire need of additional military resources. To increase its supply of weapons, the Empire planned to negotiate with an envoy in Jabba's employ on Cymoon 1, in the Corellian Industrial Cluster. The Sith Lord Darth Vader\u2014formerly Anakin Skywalker\u2014was tasked as the Imperial negotiator, with the intent of forcing Jabba's envoy in a deal favorable to the Empire. The envoy's vessel was hijacked by the Rebel Alliance, however, and a team of Rebels, including Solo, used it to assault and destroy Weapons Factory Alpha on Cymoon 1, leveling another critical defeat against the Empire.\n\nThe Emperor ordered Vader to travel to Tatooine and negotiate with Jabba personally. The Sith Lord arrived a day ahead of schedule, using his early arrival to carry out a personal mission in Jabba's Palace. Vader told Jabba that he would return on official Imperial business the next day, but, for that moment, he wanted to discuss his own mission. Jabba believed that Vader would attempt to use a mind trick to force him into doing the Dark Lord's will, but Vader said he would not, as mind tricks were not the way of the Sith. Jabba briefly considered collecting the bounty that the Rebel Alliance placed on Vader's head and throwing him into a rancor pit beneath his court, but he opted not to once he realized Vader was aware of the trap. Jabba continued his discussions with Vader and incorrectly referred to the Sith Lord as a Jedi, resulting in Vader igniting his lightsaber and becoming a target of Jabba's henchmen. The Dark Lord wiped many of the guards out before using the Force to choke Jabba, an attack that left the crime lord more amenable to Vader's demands. With Jabba ready to comply, Vader explained that he needed two of Jabba's best bounty hunters to work on a personal mission. Jabba agreed to the demands and provided him with Boba Fett and Black Krrsantan.",

Ziro entered the holographic transmission and admitted to conspiring with Dooku to kidnap Rotta and frame the Jedi, so Jabba told the senator that the Hutt Clan would severely punish Ziro. Amidala asked him if the hostilities between Jabba and the Jedi could cease and if he would open his hyperspace lanes to the Republic, to which Jabba agreed.

The chairman was able to reason with the Hutt crime lord, who, like Papanoida, knew all too well what it was like to have his child taken from him. Greedo insisted that he was not responsible, but Jabba allowed a blood sample to be taken from his bounty hunter so it could be compared to blood found at the scene of the crime. Greedo admitted to kidnapping the chairman's daughters at the behest of the Separatists, who wanted leverage against the Pantorans, and Papanoida was soon reunited with his children.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Grand Hutt Council became concerned that Ziro, who was in Galactic Republic custody, was planning on turning over incriminating evidence about the council's illicit activity, as the imprisoned Hutt had a journal secretly hidden on Teth that contained the evidence. Jabba hired bounty hunter Cad Bane to free Ziro from prison, so he could be imprisoned by the Hutt Clan instead. Bane took members of the Galactic Senate hostage inside the Senate Building, offering their safety in return for Ziro's freedom. Chancellor Palpatine refused the demands, but Palpatine soon changed his mind and allowed Ziro to be freed. Bane brought Ziro to the Grand Hutt Council on Nal Hutta, where Ziro was imprisoned once more, though Jabba himself was not present. Gardulla Besadii the Elder instead acted as a representative.\n\nJabba instead planned Ziro's elimination. He hired Ziro's old girlfriend, the singer Sy Snootles, to find the records and eliminate Ziro. Snootles freed Ziro from his imprisonment and tricked him into believing that she was on his side, so he brought her to Teth where he planned to recover his records. Once there, however, Snootles killed the crime lord and brought the records to Jabba, who expressed his gratitude for her work.\n\n",

As part of his plan, Maul formed the Shadow Collective, an alliance between the Mandalorian faction Death Watch and various elements from the criminal underworld, including Black Sun and the Pyke Syndicate. Their goal was to take over the planet Mandalore. Despite their combined might, the Shadow Collective still required additional resources, including muscle and supplies, to achieve their goal. To find these resources, they went before the Grand Hutt Council to negotiate an alliance between the Hutt Clan and the Shadow Collective. Maul, his brother Savage Opress, and Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla met with the Hutt leaders, where Maul negotiated the terms and conditions of the alliance with Jabba himself. The Hutts wanted to know what they could offer and how much their assistance was worth. Maul proposed an exchange: in return for Hutt Space and everything in its borders, he would spare their lives. Jabba and the Council were dismissive of Maul's threats, which resulted in a skirmish between the Shadow Collective and the Grand Hutt Council's forces. Maul, Opress, and Vizsla fought off various enforcers and bounty hunters, until their Death Watch reinforcements arrived. With the additional troops, Maul, Vizsla and Opress were able to rout the enemy forces and secure a victory.\n\nAlthough the Collective was triumphant, the ensuing conflict and chaos allowed all but one Hutt to escape\u2014Oruba. Maul interrogated Oruba, threatening to kill him unless he revealed where the others had escaped to. Under duress, Oruba informed Maul that he could find Jabba in his palace on Tatooine. The Shadow Collective soon arrived, facing little resistance as they made their way into Jabba's court. Maul ordered Jabba and the council to submit to his demands and join the Shadow Collective, lest they suffer his wrath. With little choice in the matter, Jabba agreed to assist the Shadow Collective in its takeover of Mandalore. The resources the Hutt Clan provided aided the Shadow Collective in its successful takeover of Mandalore, with Maul declaring himself the new leader of Mandalore. However, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious\u2014secretly Chancellor Palpatine himself\u2014came to regard Maul as a threat and targeted the Shadow Collective. The group fractured under assault by the Sith and their Separatist puppets, and Maul's plan was resoundingly defeated by Darth Sidious.\n\n",

He was the grandson of Mama and Papa the Hutts, and the nephew of Ziro and Ebor, as they were the siblings of his father. His mother left enough of a mark on him that, years later, he would force the Askajian dancer Yarna d'al' Gargan to wear special makeup to make her look more like his genitrix. He also had a cousin named Crakka and a nephew named Gorga.\n\nSeveral centuries before the Galactic Civil War, he became the reigning crime lord in the Outer Rim, owning several criminal enterprises which included smuggling, glitterstim spice dealing, slave trading, assassination and piracy. At some point, Jabba became affiliated with the Crymorah Syndicate. As a result of his collaboration with the Crymorah, he gained a position on the Grand Hutt Council. As a crime lord, Jabba based his illicit operation out of his palace in the Northern Dune Sea of the desert world Tatooine, from where he spread his operations and influence across the Outer Rim by employing a network of smugglers who moved his goods across the galaxy.\n\nForming a powerful criminal empire, his operations grew to include slavery, arms dealing, spice smuggling, and gambling. Gambling was a prominent feature of the Mos Espa Grand Arena, where Jabba controlled the gambling and concessions during the popular podraces. The spice trade was a major part of Jabba's empire, becoming one of the primary ways the Hutt made money.

He decided to ignore the insult, seeing payback against Solo as sweeter than revenge on the Nodes. Upon entering the cantina, Greedo saw its bartender, Wuher, ordering the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to leave the premises. While the Rodian steeled himself mentally for the encounter, he thought about how his former lover Uncelta fell for Solo only to have the smuggler break her heart.\n\nWhile at the bar, Greedo saw Baba lose an arm to the lightsaber of Obi-Wan Kenobi due to assaulting Luke Skywalker, an event at which he merely laughed. However, this prevented Baba and Evazan from assisting Greedo, as had been previously planned, forcing the Rodian to improvise.\n\nGreedo challenged Solo at the Mos Eisley Cantina, where, threatening Solo with his DT-12 heavy blaster pistol, he demanded that he pay the money to Jabba or to Greedo himself; or hand over Solo's legendary starship, the Millennium Falcon. When Solo replied that he would rather die than give up his ship, Greedo said that was indeed the idea before announcing that it was something he had been looking forward to for a long time. As Greedo pulled his trigger and said that he would end with him, Solo shot Greedo dead from beneath the table with his readily prepared blaster. Greedo missed Solo completely and the last thing that Greedo ever saw was a flash of bright light with a memory of bitter injustice.

        "content": "# Greedo - Mygeeto failure[]\n\nDuring the trade wars, Greedo was hired by Jabba to eliminate InterGalactic Banking Clan Vice Chairman Anolo on Mygeeto and acquire his Givin codebreaker. There, Greedo, Barada, and several of Jabba's thugs led an assault against the Vice Chairman and his guards. Greedo was able to kill Anolo and put the codebreaker into Anolo's Office. In the office, Greedo used Anolo's lightsaber to make his escape with the Givin. However, Greedo was unable to capture the Givin and it fell to its death. Greedo returned to Tatooine and went on his knees before Jabba at his palace. Greedo offered the lightsaber to Jabba, but the Hutt refused it and faced Greedo with the prospect of becoming the rancor Pateesa's food. However, Greedo was saved when the antiques collector Dok-Ondar offered to buy the lightsaber from Jabba. Ordering Greedo to carry out another task to begin rebuilding his faith in the bounty hunter, Jabba gave Greedo the simpler task of collecting a bounty on Solo's head, as the smuggler dropped a large shipment of illicit cargo owned by the Hutt to avoid Imperial arrest.\n\n",

        "content": "# Greedo - Someone shot first[]\n\nGreedo's manner of death has been subject to a number of retcons over the years. The most famous involves the question of who shot first, for in the original release of the film, as well as the script, Greedo did not shoot at Han at all. In the 1997 re-release of the film, Greedo gets a badly-aimed shot at Solo before Solo kills him. George Lucas has said that this change is to enhance Solo's overall heroism, making him seem less of a killer and more of a \"cowboy\" to viewers. This was a controversial decision and in the 2004 version the two shots are almost simultaneous, with Greedo shooting first. In A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy, there is no mention of Greedo firing a shot and author Alexandra Bracken, when asked, stated that Solo fired before Greedo could get off a shot. The 2019 release of A New Hope on Disney+ depicted Greedo saying one last word before being shot by Han, an alteration inserted by Lucas before selling Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company in 2012. However, Greedo's voice work wasn't reused footage from Blake.\n\n",

Jabba was a major figure on Tatooine, where he controlled the bulk of the piracy, slavery, and trafficking in illegal goods that generated most of the planet's wealth. He was also highly influential in the entire Outer Rim as one of its most powerful crime lords.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Jabba's influence and power over the Outer Rim, specifically its hyperlanes, was sought by both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who both courted Jabba's approval. When Rotta, Jabba's son, was kidnapped, the crime lord promised his support to whoever returned his son. When the Separatists were revealed to have orchestrated Rotta's kidnapping, Jabba pledged his support to the Republic.\n\nJabba continued to operate in the Outer Rim after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, preserving his power base, despite the interference of Darth Sidious, the Galactic Emperor. After the destruction of the Death Star by the Rebel Alliance, the Emperor sent Darth Vader to negotiate a deal with Jabba to secure raw materials for Imperial military production. Jabba's alliance with the Empire allowed him and the Hutts to resist the Imperial crackdown against criminal elements in the Outer Rim, as well as rid the Hutt of his competitors.\n\nAfter the smuggler Han Solo failed to repay him for lost cargo, Jabba placed a high price on his head. Solo was eventually delivered to him by one of his bounty hunters, Boba Fett, as a gift from Darth Vader. However, this capture brought him to the attention of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who sought to rescue his friend from Jabba's imprisonment. As he attempted to execute the Jedi and his allies in the Great Pit of Carkoon, Jabba was choked to death by Leia Organa. With the Hutts unable to decide who would inherit Jabba's criminal ventures, many of his slaves, including the Niktos, were free, and his palace was occupied by his former Majordomo Bib Fortuna, who took his place as Daimyo of Tatooine until Fett killed and usurped him. Fett sought to rebuild Jabba's criminal empire in his own image, intending to rule with respect rather than the fear that the Hutt instilled in his followers.\n\n",

Shortly after the outbreak of the war, Jabba's infant son, Rotta, was kidnapped. Though Jabba did not know who the kidnapper was, it was carried out by his uncle, Ziro, and the Separatist Alliance, both of whom had their own schemes at play. Jabba requested the assistance of anyone who could help, and the Republic and the Jedi Order answered the call. It was the hope of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine that the Republic would be able to negotiate an alliance with Jabba for use of Hutt hyperspace lanes in the Outer Rim, as the Separatists controlled the major lanes.\n\nThe Jedi sent General Anakin Skywalker, who had become a Jedi Knight in the years since his victory in the Boonta Eve Classic, and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, to the Teth system to find Rotta. Meanwhile, General Obi-Wan Kenobi traveled to Tatooine to personally negotiate a treaty with Jabba. While the Jedi Master was en route, Jabba was presented with the heads of bounty hunters he had sent to Teth to find his son. Infuriated by the lack of progress, Jabba contacted Chancellor Palpatine and, through his translator droid, TC-70, demanded to know why the Jedi were not searching for his son. The chancellor assured the crime lord that the Jedi were on their way, of which Jabba said the treaty with him depended on.\n\nKenobi soon arrived at Jabba's Palace and was taken before the Hutt's court. Kenobi told Jabba that Skywalker, who he described as one of the Order's most powerful Jedi, was on his way to Teth to rescue Rotta and that the Jedi would not let the Hutt down. Jabba attached one additional condition to the proposed treaty\u2014that the Jedi deliver him the kidnapper as well, dead or alive. Jabba also leveled a threat against the Jedi: if they did not succeed, the Separatist leader Count Dooku and the Separatist Droid Army would\u2014still not knowing that Dooku himself was behind the kidnapping, in a plot to turn the Hutt Clan into an enemy of the Republic. Kenobi departed the palace, which was followed by the arrival of Count Dooku himself. The Sith Lord claimed that it was the Jedi who kidnapped Rotta and that the Jedi were plotting to destroy Jabba. Jabba demanded proof, which Dooku delivered in the form of a manipulated holographic recording allegedly showing Skywalker and Tano, who had found Rotta on Teth, harming the child, when in reality they were caring for it after he had fallen ill. Dooku told the crime lord that the Separatist Droid Army was initiating a rescue mission and would soon deliver the Huttlet to his father. All Dooku asked in return was that Jabba join the Separatist cause.\n\nDooku's Sith acolyte, Asajj Ventress, contacted the count, who played her message in front of Jabba and his court. Ventress claimed that Skywalker killed Rotta and was on his way to Tatooine. Jabba questioned why the Jedi would come to Tatooine, to which Dooku said that the Jedi plot had become clear and that Skywalker would soon arrive to kill the crime lord and wipe out the entire Hutt Clan. Dooku promised Jabba that he would personally deal with Skywalker and, despite fighting the Jedi Knight in a lightsaber duel in the desert, Skywalker managed to reach Jabba's Palace. Once there, Skywalker found that Tano, who had Rotta and from whom he had become separated, had not yet reached the palace. Jabba's henchmen drew their weapons on Skywalker, so the Jedi Knight drew his lightsaber and pointed it at Jabba\u2014seemingly confirming Dooku's claims. Jabba said that this was proof that Skywalker had arrived to kill him, but the Jedi said he had only come to negotiate. Just as Jabba's henchmen prepared to kill Skywalker, Tano arrived and delivered Rotta to his father.",

Jabba then paired up Greedo with the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee companion Chewbacca for a special mission; retrieving a verillix urn which contained the ashes of one of Jabba's most hated rivals, Krestrel D'Naran. The reward for the urn was one million credits, which would be split between the hired hunters. Once they reached Corellia in the Millennium Falcon, Greedo brought Solo and Chewbacca to the planet's Pearl District. He told them that the urn was being kept in a safe within the penthouse of Augustus Graves, Chief Executive Officer of the Corellian Engineering Corporation. After briefly sneaking inside the penthouse, Solo informed Greedo that the safe was a Locris 1-42-08 and that they would need something as strong as a turbolaser to cut through it. Solo assured Greedo he would think of something before he and Chewbacca left the smuggler to think over a Montalsian ale. Later, Solo returned to Greedo and Chewbacca on the Falcon, informing them that he met a man named Ovan who claimed to be his father. When Greedo asked him if they were on Corellia for sentiment or to do a job, Solo explained that as a shipbuilder, Ovan had access to equipment they would need to get into the penthouse. Greedo then asked how they would get in, to which Chewbacca pointed out that Graves had hired private security following the break-in. To this, Solo claimed that the guards would be their way inside.\n\nAfter regrouping with Solo, Chewbacca and Ovan, Greedo watched as Solo used an explosive to break into a laundromat and took three security uniforms. As Chewbacca left to retrieve their getaway vehicle, Solo, Greedo and Ovan disguised themselves as guards and approached the building. Ovan managed to bluff their way inside and the three of them made their way to a turbolift. Upon reaching the door to the penthouse, Greedo began to work on the electrolock but found that he couldn't open it. Solo then contacted an actual guard and asked them to remotely unlock the door for them due to the lock malfunctioning. The ploy worked and the guard opened the door, allowing them to enter the penthouse. Once they were inside, Solo told Greedo to keep watch and not touch anything while he and Ovan opened the safe. As they got to work, Greedo noticed a few expensive looking items and picked one of them up. He was then confronted by Solo, who informed him that the safe was empty and that his intel had been wrong. Noticing the item Greedo was holding, Solo reminded him that he was told not to touch anything. Greedo remarked that it was worth at least ten thousand credits before Solo pointed out that it was tagged with an MSX tracker. An alarm then sounded throughout the building and the three of them ran for the turbolift, only to be met by a group of armed security guards.",

As Chewbacca left to retrieve their getaway vehicle, Solo, Greedo and Ovan disguised themselves as guards and approached the building. Ovan managed to bluff their way inside and the three of them made their way to a turbolift. Upon reaching the door to the penthouse, Greedo began to work on the electrolock but found that he couldn't open it. Solo then contacted an actual guard and asked them to remotely unlock the door for them due to the lock malfunctioning. The ploy worked and the guard opened the door, allowing them to enter the penthouse. Once they were inside, Solo told Greedo to keep watch and not touch anything while he and Ovan opened the safe. As they got to work, Greedo noticed a few expensive looking items and picked one of them up. He was then confronted by Solo, who informed him that the safe was empty and that his intel had been wrong. Noticing the item Greedo was holding, Solo reminded him that he was told not to touch anything. Greedo remarked that it was worth at least ten thousand credits before Solo pointed out that it was tagged with an MSX tracker. An alarm then sounded throughout the building and the three of them ran for the turbolift, only to be met by a group of armed security guards.\n\nGreedo fired at the guards, though the blast bounced off from the transparisteel windows. This gave Solo an idea, leading him to call another group of guards for medical assistance, call Chewbacca for backup and break one of the windows with Ovan's plasma cutter. The guards then arrived in a medshuttle and Solo stunned the driver, allowing them to escape and rendezvous with Chewbacca. Once they used a landspeeder to return to the Falcon, Solo had Greedo look for a hydrospanner, only for him to be left on Corellia as the Falcon flew away. Luckily, Greedo was picked up by Khel Tanna and her crew aboard their starship before they left for Graves' planetoid Mollo Tanka. Once they reached the planetoid, they found Solo and Chewbacca being chased by Graves' guards, including the bounty hunter Krrsantan. The crew then fired on the guards and brought the smuggler and Wookiee aboard before taking off from Mollo Tanka. As Solo expressed his gratitude, Greedo punched the smuggler for leaving him stranded on Corellia. Solo then led the crew back to the shop on Antillion where they found the urn, for which they would share the reward. However, once they reached the shop, they found that the urn was gone. Chewbacca then realized that Ovan had been an imposter and had faked being unconscious to make off with the urn and the Falcon. Solo then revealed that he had placed a tracker on the conman as insurance. Once they left Antillion, Greedo informed Tanna that the tracker led to the Benelex Marshal Service Headquarters on Paqualis III. After landing on a nearby platform, the crew split up, with Greedo, Chewbacca, and Ooris Bynar retrieving the imposter, a wanted criminal named Corbus Tyra, while Solo, Tanna, T'onga, and Akko stayed on the ship. As they brought Tyra aboard, Chewbacca was blasted and arrested by Marshal Buck Vancto. Solo tried to stop the crew from leaving, to which Greedo intervened and shot Solo in the chest.\n\nSolo did survive, though he was left unconscious. Despite Greedo wishing to finish him off, the crew instead dropped him off on Escalan before leaving to retrieve the Falcon. With Tyra's help, they found the ship at an Imperial Impound Facility on Iakar. Sneaking into the facility along with T'onga and Tyra, Greedo created a diversion while the crew fought their way toward the Falcon. Once they had the ship, they fled the facility and regrouped on an asteroid. Tyra then opened the compartment on the ship where he had stored the urn, only to find that it was gone. Upon learning that the urn was now in the possession of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Tanna's crew gave up and decided to go their separate ways. After cheating in a game of Sabacc, Greedo won ownership of the Falcon. Following this, he left to celebrate in Chalmun's Cantina, only to be found by Solo, Chewbacca and an escaped prisoner named Phaedra. Upon being interrogated, Greedo told them the urn was stored in Tarkin's office on Coruscant and that the Falcon was in a docking bay in Mos Entha. Solo then punched Greedo and left him unconscious in the street as he and his crew left to retrieve the Falcon. Sometime later, Greedo was met by Tyra, who supplied him with burnt Ronto meat to pass off to Jabba as D'Naran's ashes. Despite Jabba's suspicions, the ploy worked and Greedo received the reward. He then met back up with Tyra, who told Greedo that he wanted to tie up loose ends since he still had a score to settle with Solo.\n\n",

However, before he could do so, he became intoxicated and lost the horn to the Abyssin Myo in a card game. Unbeknownst to Car'n, Myo promptly became similarly intoxicated and lost it, the Talz pickpocket Muftak having stolen it. Now without his horn to sell to the Rodian loan shark, Car'n hired Sakiyan bounty hunter Djas Puhr to retrieve it. Though Puhr had also been hired to retrieve it by Myo, Car'n promised him a payout of two hundred credits in exchange for the kloo horn.\n\nCar'n was found by Greedo, accompanied by hired muscle, namely Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba. Despite not having the money, Greedo granted Car'n clemency, in part because of Car'n's pleas for mercy and also because of Greedo's mission to kill the smuggler Han Solo, who was also in Chalmun's Cantina at the time.\n\nEventually, Puhr acquired the horn from an individual known as The Scrapper, who had in turn acquired it from Muftak's companion Kabe, having sold the item to pay off a loan to Ackmena. Car'n confronted the combined group of pickpockets, thieves, and scoundrels at a table at the cantina. In the heated conversation it became clear that much of the group's complicated caper stemmed from Solo's failure to deliver his cargo of narcotics to Muftak, but Puhr convinced the group to let the smuggler live, promising to pay off all the debts himself.\n\nThough Greedo's attempt to murder Solo went forward, this was hampered by the arrival of Luke Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in the cantina, who, in an altercation, incapacitated Baba and Evazan. Without his henchmen, Greedo confronted Solo alone and was killed. With Car'n now debt-free, Puhr returned his kloo horn, defusing the situation.\n\n",

While his mind was more interested on Kenobi's display with the lightsaber, Wuher dragged Greedo's body out of the building and cleaned up the Rodian's blood.

The successful jobs he did carry out were regarded as mid-level affairs and were forgotten with time.

        "content": "# Jabba Desilijic Tiure - Crime amid tyranny[]\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire, and the chancellor declared himself Emperor. Jabba continued his illicit operations during the Age of the Empire, continuing to hold influence as a crime lord. Around one year into the Empire's reign, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano decided against going to Jabba for help while avoiding the Imperial Military, deciding the Hutt would not help her despite her role in saving his son during the Clone Wars.\n\nDuring a particularly bad drought on Tatooine, Jabba began collecting a hefty water tax from local moisture farmers. This earned his thugs an unpleasant encounter with Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was watching and protecting a young Luke Skywalker. When Skywalker attempted to steal the thugs' collections for the day, they caught and threatened to kill him. It was at that moment that Kenobi took down the thugs with the Force. Under cover of darkness, the gangsters were unable to identify Kenobi. Most displeased with his loss of tax revenue, Jabba hired the Wookiee bounty hunter Krrsantan to track down and identify the former Jedi Master.\n\nStreet orphan and later rebel Jedi Ezra Bridger identified himself as \"Jabba\" whenever he wanted to keep his real name secret, for example to Imperial officers.\n\nIn 10 BBY, the scoundrel Tobias Beckett came into contact with Jabba and intended to travel to Tatooine to work for him once he decided to leave Crimson Dawn, but he was killed by Han Solo at Savareen before that could come to be. As such, Jabba hired Solo for his operations, who became the best smuggler on Jabba's payroll. Solo's standing was jeopardized, however, when his ship, the Millennium Falcon, was boarded by Imperial authorities, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo. Jabba demanded compensation for the lost cargo and, when Solo could not pay, the crime lord sent bounty hunters after him. One such hunter was Greedo, who confronted Solo in a cantina in Mos Eisley, but Solo killed the Rodian bounty hunter before he could kill Solo. Jabba learned of this and found Solo in Docking Bay 94, where the smuggler said that he had no choice but to dump his cargo. Jabba agreed to give Solo an extension on the payment in exchange for fifteen percent interest. Solo accepted the offer, but he soon became involved in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and once again failed to pay Jabba. When Jabba learned that Solo had joined the Rebellion, Jabba placed a large bounty on the smuggler's head.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, in which the Alliance\u2014with Solo's help\u2014destroyed the Imperial, planet-destroying battle station known as the Death Star, the Empire was left in dire need of additional military resources. To increase its supply of weapons, the Empire planned to negotiate with an envoy in Jabba's employ on Cymoon 1, in the Corellian Industrial Cluster. The Sith Lord Darth Vader\u2014formerly Anakin Skywalker\u2014was tasked as the Imperial negotiator, with the intent of forcing Jabba's envoy in a deal favorable to the Empire. The envoy's vessel was hijacked by the Rebel Alliance, however, and a team of Rebels, including Solo, used it to assault and destroy Weapons Factory Alpha on Cymoon 1, leveling another critical defeat against the Empire.\n\nThe Emperor ordered Vader to travel to Tatooine and negotiate with Jabba personally. The Sith Lord arrived a day ahead of schedule, using his early arrival to carry out a personal mission in Jabba's Palace. Vader told Jabba that he would return on official Imperial business the next day, but, for that moment, he wanted to discuss his own mission. Jabba believed that Vader would attempt to use a mind trick to force him into doing the Dark Lord's will, but Vader said he would not, as mind tricks were not the way of the Sith. Jabba briefly considered collecting the bounty that the Rebel Alliance placed on Vader's head and throwing him into a rancor pit beneath his court, but he opted not to once he realized Vader was aware of the trap. Jabba continued his discussions with Vader and incorrectly referred to the Sith Lord as a Jedi, resulting in Vader igniting his lightsaber and becoming a target of Jabba's henchmen. The Dark Lord wiped many of the guards out before using the Force to choke Jabba, an attack that left the crime lord more amenable to Vader's demands. With Jabba ready to comply, Vader explained that he needed two of Jabba's best bounty hunters to work on a personal mission. Jabba agreed to the demands and provided him with Boba Fett and Black Krrsantan.\n\nAs promised, Vader returned to Jabba's court the next day to continue the official negotiations on behalf of the Empire. The negotiations concluded with Jabba agreeing to provide the Imperial war machine with whatever resources it required. Jabba requested only that the Emperor pay him well, to which Vader said that the Empire would pay him whatever they felt was appropriate. Additionally, as long as Jabba complied with Imperial demands, the Empire would allow Jabba to continue operating his criminal empire. Jabba convinced Vader to briefly stay on Tatooine for a feast and entertainment in the Sith Lord's honor, and the entertainment proved to be the hunting of wild bantha. Jabba hosted the Sith Lord on his sail barge, where Jabba inquired as to whether the two bounty hunters had proven themselves useful thus far. Vader stated that their missions would be simple enough: capture an Imperial agent working for the Emperor, and locate the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. Vader also demanded to know everything that Jabba knew about Obi-Wan Kenobi, who lived in exile on Tatooine for nearly two decades. Jabba told him only that Kenobi had proven to be a thorn in his side in those years.\n\n",

Several months after Solo's rescue, a decision had yet to be made. Immediately following Jabba's demise, in order to determine the exact nature of the Hutt's death and settle the debate over the matter of his will, the Hutt Clan had the wreckage of the Khetanna examined. What they found was only a holorecording of Organa choking Jabba in his last moments. Most of the circulated copies of this footage and their vendors were hunted down by the Clan to prevent proof of their own vulnerability from circulating.\n\nMany of Jabba's slaves were freed after the battle at Carkoon, leading the prominently enslaved Niktos to admire Organa for choking the Hutt, earning her the nickname \"Huttslayer.\" Coupled with the Empire's collapse, Jabba's death left enormous power vacuums in the Kessel spice trade, leaving trade routes once guarded by Hutt-hired mercenaries vulnerable. Over the years following Jabba's death, a Huttese song known as \"Jabba Flow,\" composed by the Shag Kava band, was named after Jabba as was a non-alcoholic beverage known as \"Jabba Juice.\"\n\nBib Fortuna returned to the palace and took over Jabba's criminal operations. Around 9 ABY, Boba Fett, joined by his accomplice Fennec Shand, stormed the palace. Fett slayed Fortuna and took control of the remnants of Jabba's criminal empire. Jabba's cousins \"the Twins\" attempted to take control of his territory, but they fled Tatooine upon learning the Pyke Syndicate was moving in. Standing his ground, Fett and his allies overcame the Pykes, claiming Tatooine as the former bounty hunter's domain.\n\nDuring his self-imposed exile on Ahch-To, the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker had a dream where he ignored Organa's message and never joined the Rebellion and never caused Jabba's death. In his dream, Jabba was still operating on Tatooine following Skywalker's marriage to Camie Marstrap and was still charging water taxes to moisture farmers.\n\n",

Nix showed aggression towards Jabba by attacking him. After a conflict, Jabba decided to send Vess along with Vail Tormin, a bounty hunter who was after Vess and tried to escape from the Palace with her, to discover the identity of a spy that the crime syndicate Zerek Besh placed in Jabba's Palace. In return, Jabba would forgive the two of them for the confusion at the Palace, return Nix, and allow the two of them to leave Tatooine alive. The mission was a success and the spy was discovered. Jabba decided to collect on the debt that Vess' fellow BX commando droid, ND-5, owed him, sending Vess to acquire compromising information against Governor Thorden, an Imperial who had great control over the Empire's presence on the moon Toshara. Jabba intended to use the information to force Thorden to use his control over the moon to favor the Hutt Cartel, thus gaining an advantage over the Pyke Syndicate, which controlled almost all of Toshara. Vess was successful and delivered the information to Jabba at his palace.\n\n",

R2 carried with him a message from Skywalker, who declared himself a Jedi Knight and announced his intention to bargain for Solo's life. The young Jedi said he would arrive soon, and he offered the two droids as a gift for the crime lord. Jabba boasted that there would be no bargain, however, and conscripted the two droids into his service. 3PO became his new translator, while R2 would serve drinks on Jabba's sail barge.\n\nLater, during a performance of the song \"Jedi Rocks\" by the Max Rebo Band, Jabba's personal dancer, Oola, resisted his advances toward her, and the Hutt activated the trapdoor and sent her to her death in the rancor pit. The chaotic moment was followed by the arrival of Princess Leia Organa, who, as part of the rescue plan, came disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh and brought Chewbacca as her \"prisoner.\" Tipped off by Boba Fett, Jabba knew it was not really Boushh under the helmet, but he thought the impostor was just a short lowlife smuggler. The disguised Organa demanded the bounty on the Wookiee's head and insisted on 50,000 credits, which Jabba balked at. Organa threatened him with a detonator, leading Jabba to compliment Boushh, and the two agreed on 35,000 credits. Chewbacca was imprisoned in Jabba's dungeons, while Organa waited in the palace so she could free Solo after the court had gone to sleep.\n\nOrgana freed Solo from carbonite that evening, but Jabba and his court discovered them. Solo tried to bargain with the gangster, saying he was on his way to pay Jabba when Fett captured him, but Jabba said it was too late to pay him and imprisoned Solo. Now having seen Organa's real identity, Jabba ordered his guards to bring her to him. Ignoring the princess's threats, Jabba licked Organa's face. He then sent his dancers to have Organa cleaned and dressed in a dancing-girl costume. The crime lord chained Organa to his throne, forcing her to replace Oola as his favorite slave. Jabba and his court proceeded to celebrate late into the night.\n\nThe next morning, Jabba and his thugs were awoken by Skywalker's arrival at the palace. Skywalker was able to gain entry by using a mind trick on Fortuna, despite Jabba's strict orders not to admit the Jedi. Skywalker demanded that Jabba free Solo and his friends, or else face his destruction. Jabba refused, causing Skywalker to pull a blaster on him, at which point Jabba activated the trapdoor and sent Skywalker and a Gamorrean guard into the rancor pit. The rancor ate the guard, but Skywalker was able to kill the beast, infuriating the gangster. In his anger, Jabba choked Organa and demanded that Solo and Chewbacca be brought before him.\n\nAs revenge for the outrage, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca were to be executed by being fed to the sarlacc, a creature that dwelled in the Great Pit of Carkoon. Meanwhile, Organa was to remain enslaved to the Hutt, as Jabba found her attractive. Jabba and his court traveled to the Great Pit of Carkoon on his sail barge, while the prisoners were transported on a smaller skiff. On the way, Jabba briefly allowed Organa to leave his side so that she could watch her friends from a window, but later recalled her to his throne to inform her that she would soon learn to appreciate him. Jabba toasted his plans by sharing his drink with Organa.",

        "content": "# Jabba Desilijic Tiure - Getting back at Han Solo[]\n\nThree years after the Battle of Yavin, Fett was once again hired by Darth Vader to track down the Millennium Falcon, which Vader used in his hunt for Luke Skywalker\u2014who he had discovered was the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. The resulting capture of the Rebel vessel led to Solo's capture at Cloud City, Bespin, and he was frozen in carbonite as a test to ensure the process would work on Skywalker despite Fett's concerns that Solo could result killed. Despite Vader's promises to compensate him if Solo died, Solo survived with no harm and Fett was given the frozen smuggler to take him to Jabba so he could claim the bounty in exchange for his services to the Empire. Solo's friends tried to rescue him, but ultimately failed and Fett left with Solo aboard Slave I.\n\nShortly after the Empire's takeover of Cloud City, Lando Calrissian went to Tatooine alongside Chewbacca, Solo's Wookiee companion, aboard the Millennium Falcon to check if Fett had already delivered Solo to Jabba so in case he hadn't, they could look for leads on Fett. Tricking the Harlok Gang into escorting them to Jabba's Palace after they saved them from a group of TIE starfighters by saying them that as Baron Administrator of Cloud City he wanted to negotiate with Jabba a deal for shipments of tibanna gas, Calrissian was brought to Jabba's Palace. After waiting for a while, Calrissian was brought before Jabba by Biff Fortuna. For his relief, Calrissian learned that Solo hadn't been delivered yet, as Fett was nowhere to be seen and Jabba didn't know about Solo's capture.\n\nHowever, Jabba demanded to know why Calrissian had lied to the Harlok Gang, as no tibanna arrangement between them had taken place and he had lost his position as Baron Administrator since the Imperial takeover. Calrissian admitted his ruse and proposed Jabba to lend him some of his fighters to take back Cloud City and give him tibanna gas at a good price, only to learn that Jabba had already made a tibanna deal with the Empire. Acknowledging that the former Baron Administrator had arrived on Tatooine with the Millennium Falcon, Jabba decided to take the Falcon as a partial payment and feed Calrissian to his rancor unless he had something else useful to offer. Desperate, Calrissian offered Jabba the knowledge of who had Solo in possession, but Jabba required more. With nothing more to offer, Calrissian told Jabba that he was currently working with the Rebellion, so he could tip him off from any information he desired to know.\n\nDuring Bokku the Hutt's strike against the Empire, as Bokku was truly an agent of the reemerging Crimson Dawn syndicate, Vader boarded the War barge of the Hutt Council and butchered the council members aboard to end the attack. Vader's massacre left Jabba the only surviving member of the Hutt Council, thus giving him complete control over the Hutt Clans. Afterward, Fett brought Solo to Tatooine, where he collected the bounty Jabba placed on Solo's head. For a year, Solo was kept encased in carbonite and displayed in Jabba's court, as Jabba decided it was his favorite decoration. Unknown to Jabba at the time was that Solo's friends were plotting his rescue.\n\n",

        "content": "# Jabba Desilijic Tiure - Personality and traits[]\n\nLeader of one of the most famous cartels in the galaxy, Jabba Desilijic Tiure technically controlled Tatooine's underworld. He was legendary for his vicious temper, endless greed, gruesome appetite and fondness for violent entertainment. The Hutt was also known to collect various trophies that signified his power. One of the most prominent examples was when he hung Han Solo's carbonite-frozen body on the wall of his throne room as a decoration. Unlike his uncle Ebor, Jabba had remarkably poor table manners. Jabba had a tattoo of the Desilijic kajidic symbol on his right arm.\n\nJabba had an affinity for young female humanoids, often enslaving them as dancers or companions. He would chain his favorite slave girls to his throne and force them to sit with him when they weren't dancing, as was the case with Oola and Leia Organa. According to Jess, Jabba's favorite slave was better protected from harassment from the palace guards and guests, though that protection came at the cost of dealing with Jabba's advances. Jabba's penchant for female humanoids would eventually become his downfall when Organa used her proximity to the Hutt to kill him.\n\nJabba didn't tolerate liars. When Lando Calrissian was brought before him by the Harlok Gang by saying that he had arranged a deal with Jabba for tibanna gas, Jabba made him know that he perfectly knew that no such deal had ever taken place, leading the Hutt to threaten Calrissian to feed him to his rancor for daring to obtain an audience with him under false pretenses. Nor did he tolerate those who rebelled against him, placing severe punishments against them, like when he threw Oola into the rancor pit for disobeying him during a dance.\n\nDespite his ruthless reputation and cruel personality, Jabba nevertheless had a caring side: he loved his son Rotta very much and became furious when he was kidnapped by the Separatists, willing to punish those responsible with death. His tender love for his son is specifically shown when he was willing to work with the Jedi despite their mutual resentment and as such endanger himself to see to it they successfully rescued him. Jabba had a friend, his only friend in fact, in Ephant Mon. However, Boba Fett pondered if he was the closest person Jabba saw as a friend. Some nights in the Palace, Jabba told Fett incredibly personal things that Fett believed ate at the crime lord's soul, although Fett was unsure if Jabba had a soul. Fett also did not understand what Jabba said to him. However, he enjoyed the drink offered during such moments and, taking into account how much Jabba paid him, respected the company as tolerable.\n\n",

Solo balked at the suggestion while Skywalker offered one last opportunity to free them and threatened to kill Jabba if he did not, much to Jabba and his guest's amusement. The crime lord refused and ordered the prisoners into the pit, but R2 revealed Skywalker's hidden lightsaber, and the Jedi attacked Jabba's thugs. The growing battle led to chaos on Jabba's sail barge, as his enforcers attempted to kill the Jedi and the Rebels. In the ensuing panic, Organa, after smashing Jabba's control panel and disabling the lights in the room, wrapped the chain she was bound in around Jabba's neck and strangled him to death, bringing an end to the criminal reign of Jabba the Hutt. After his death, Solo and his friends escaped, and Jabba's corpse was blown up when his sail barge exploded over the sarlacc pit.\n\n",

There they saw several Tusken Raiders, who demanded that Jabba should prevent Jawas and Imperials from continuing to enter their dunes. However, Jabba did not care about their problems, made fun of them and eventually threatened them indirectly, but finally assured them that he would take care of the matter. When Cantonica's two traders put forth their requests, Jabba presented them a purchase, but refused to give it to them, emphasizing that this was the only quantity of desert wine on Tatooine and they should not come up with the idea of stealing the Tuskens' property during one of their night prayer at highmoon at the Great Dune, because then they would die.\n\nHowever, in a bar in Mos Eisley the traders decided to steal the desert wine, especially since the price had risen. They were overheard by a Jawa, who went immediately to his people to tell them about the expensive wine. However, they were watched by an Imperial droid, who in turn informed an Imperial captain about the wine. During the night, the two traders went to the Great Dune, where they discovered that there were no Tuskens. Soon after, a few Jawas with battle droids appeared as well as Imperial stormtroopers with their captain. They all demanded that each other lower their weapons. Before shots were fired, the Rodian tried to convince all parties that there desert wine and someone had planned for them to be there. At that moment, the Imperial captain was shot dead by Boba Fett, who was hiding in the dunes. Thereupon carnage broke out, which the Tuskens, who had pitched their camp a few yards away, noticed. The next day, the Tuskens rode their banthas to Jabba's palace, dragging corpses of stormtroopers behind them. At the palace, they were briefly stopped by Bib Fortuna and some Gamorrean guards, but Jabba ordered his people to lower their weapons and accepted the tribute of the Tuskens to him.\n\nShortly thereafter, he was informed by Fortuna that a Coruscant cartel had found a way to artificially produce the desert wine, and now the wine was worthless, according to Fortuna. Jabba told his majordomo that he was a fool, took a massive gulp of the wine, and dropped the empty container to the ground, proclaiming that it was priceless.\n\n",

Jabba initially told them that he did not deal with such weapons, as this was prohibited by Imperial law. When Starros asked him about the twelve crates, Jabba said that perhaps Starros herself could be the thief, and referred to her relationship with Han Solo. Starros said that she had no relationship with Solo and then demanded 20,000 credits for the names of the thieves, who, according to her, were the Krawg pirates. At the same moment, a Krawg pirate appeared behind them and accused them of lying, but was shot dead by Starros. He carried one of the blasters, so Jabba believed and paid her.

They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley town house, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand.\n\nOne of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off of Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley.\n\nJabba learned of the Modal Nodes' breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party, and a massive firefight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher, who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing the day Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. Occasionally, Chalmun's night-shift manager, Ackmena, would liven the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms. However, Cheel was not present when they played during the Imperial curfew.\n\nShortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of sabacc. He lost the bet, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded, and the Modal Nodes went on to play the intergalactic circuit.\n\n",

The band was commonly referred to simply as the Modal Nodes, although Figrin D'an insisted on placing his full name before the band's name at every show. As a bandleader, \"Fiery\" Figrin D'an was extremely demanding. He was highly critical of every performance and criticized the band heavily if they were to miss even a single note. With the exception of Dorenian Beshniquel-player Doikk Na'ts, Figrin owned all of the band members' instruments and equipment. Figrin was never shy when it came to doling out orders to the others. As a general rule, the Modal Nodes refused to perform at weddings as they felt it cheapened them as a band. The Lady Valarian incident was a rare and presumably regrettable exception to this rule.\n\nAlthough the members of the Modal Nodes were always able to conduct themselves professionally, tempers would occasionally flare creating instability within the ranks. Tech Mo'r, in particular, despised Figrin Da'n due to the latter's compulsive gambling.\n\nThe comlink number for contacting the Modal Nodes was 346.9876-Bithband.\n\nFigrin D'an II and the New Modal Nodes often played the group's tunes.\n\n",

The artists were not given screen credit for these roles.\n\nIn 2006, Hasbro released a special Power of the Force series mail-in offer for a five-piece action-figure lot containing the members of the Modal Nodes. Included in the lot were Figrin Da'n, Doikk Na'ts, Tedn Dahai, Tech Mo'r, and Nalan Cheel. For reasons unknown, Ickabel G'ont Sun'il Ei'de and Lirin Car'n were not included in the set.\n\nThe two musical numbers performed in A New Hope were both composed and conducted by Oscar-winning composer John Williams. A CD single of the cantina tracks was entitled Star Wars: Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes. The tracks were listed as \"Cantina Band #1\" and \"Cantina Band #2.\" Both songs are likewise included on many versions of the official Star Wars: A New Hope soundtracks. A disco version of \"Cantina Band #1\" appeared on the album Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk by Meco.\n\nThree Bith musicians can be seen in the scene when Anakin meets Padm\u00e9 on the streets of Coruscant in \"Clone Wars Chapter 21.\" It is unknown if they were members of the Modal Nodes.\n\n",

        "content": "# Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes - Career[]\n\nDuring the height of the Clone Wars, the band was part of Jasod Revoc's Galactic Revue.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes had entered into an exclusive contract with the Tatooine crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. They routinely gigged at both Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse. The Modal Nodes were not content with merely playing the Mos Eisley circuit, and it wasn't long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the opportunistic Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand.\n\nOne of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the hunter D'Wopp, a fellow Whipid. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley. During one of their set breaks, Figrin took the band's retainer and spent the bulk of it at the casino's sabacc tables. The other musicians grew gravely concerned. Thanks to Figrin's gambling, their chances of getting off Tatooine alive were quickly dwindling.\n\nJabba learned of the Modal Nodes' breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party, and a massive firefight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher, who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening . They were performing the day Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. Occasionally, Chalmun's night-shift manager, Ackmena, would liven the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms.\n\nOne evening Imperial Intelligence suspected that subversive activity was taking place in Mos Eisley. As such, they placed a mandatory curfew on the port city, requiring everyone to return to their homes immediately. The Modal Nodes were just finishing up a set at the time the decree was broadcast. They were quite vocal about stopping the show early, but Ackmena assuaged their concerns by offering the group one round of free drinks.\n\nShortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of sabacc. He lost the bet, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded, and the Modal Nodes agreed to finally leave Tatooine. They went on to play the intergalactic circuit, receiving lukewarm reviews.\n\nIn 1 ABY the Modal Nodes played at Nym's Stronghold on the planet Lok during Nym's Anniversary Bash. Later the same year the band gave several holiday concerts during Life Day festivities beneath the branches of giant Trees of Life in Coronet, Theed, Kachirho, Wayfar, Dearic and Doaba Guerfel.\n\nIn later years, the band performed in many places. They had a five-month stint at Shanko's Hive (which ended when a bad gambling debt forced them to escape by stowing away on a ship) and later the floating casinos on Dac, until the rest of the band got tired of Figrin's gambling habit and left for Bespin in 24 ABY, where the Modal Nodes were hired to work at the SkyCenter Galleria amusement park at Cloud City. Due to the presence and actions of Black Sun on Bespin, including the death of park co-owner Cojahn, the band left early for their own safety, going into hiding on their homeworld of Clak'dor VII. After the park's surviving co-owner, Lando Calrissian, tracked them down and learned why they left, he promised them that they would still have a place at the Galleria once Black Sun was taken care of.\n\n",

        "content": "# Fitz Roi - Biography[]\n\nRoi was famous because of his mastery with the Faln horn and the stage shows he managed. His career had been initially sponsored by a young female from House Barnaba, who was infatuated with Roi, but later on Roi found success by himself.\n\nRoi's family was native to Lenniera, but Roi himself was a successful star often touring, and he only visited his family's home rarely, preferring his own home at Esseles. Ever paranoid, Roi even leveled a plagiarism lawsuit at Acme Robopolish, a window-cleaning company, believing that their droids had stolen some of his songs.\n\nHe was deported from Rimma before he was to perform a concert due to his discharging of his pistols while in the Crystal Room of Teirra Parko. His fans rioted and caused several hundred thousands of credits damage to the city of Recardeon.\n\nRoi had two slugthrowers stolen from him by the thief known as Tombat. The slugthrowers were relics from the Manderon Period, and had been crafted, if rumors were to be believed, by legendary artisan Andel Tanner. Roi usually shot his guns off during the concert.\n\nAfter Roi's Summerside Tour was canceled, he chose to play at the Priole Danna Festival, a planetary event from Lamuir IV. During his play, his guns were stolen by the same Tombat who owned them in the first place. Due to his guns, his sponsor, Flangth-2-Go, eventually pulled their support with him.\n\nWhile performing at the Arcopola Baas Music Festival in Greccia, Roi debuted his new song Tymin' Downband. It was his first public appearance since the Priole Danna Festival two years earlier. He also announced he would start a new tour, beginning on the planet Gambolla.\n\nLater on, during a concert on Esseles, Roi was known because he went on stage dressed as a Jedi Knight.\n\n",

        "content": "# Mad About Me - Performances[]\n\n\"Mad About Me\" was written at some point before 3643 BBY. The Toydarian junk dealer Watto often hummed the tune to himself in his shop in Mos Espa, on the planet Tatooine. By 0 BBY, the song had become a favorite of the Bith jizz band Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes. The tune, though fairly nondescript, was bouncy, and the Modal Nodes' rendition of it was particularly upbeat. In 0 BBY, the Modal Nodes got a job as the regular band at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley. On the day the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and his protege Luke Skywalker came to Mos Eisley in search of transport off Tatooine, the band squabbled over their choice of song before choosing \"Mad About Me.\" The band, however, was unaccustomed to performing at places like Chalmun's, and their performance of it was off both key and tempo, glaringly noticeable to patrons with sensitive hearing like the Chadra-Fan Kabe. Shortly after their performance began, Kenobi and Skywalker arrived; upon entering, Skywalker was harassed by two of the patrons, Ponda Baba and Cornelius Evazan. As the situation turned violent, Kenobi brought out his lightsaber and cut off Baba's arm. Where a band more experienced with the cantina would have continued to play in harmony with the chaos around them, the Modal Nodes promptly stopped, but when the fracas had died down they picked up where they had left off and finished the song.\n\nLater that year, the Modal Nodes played a performance of \"Mad About Me\" for an interplanetary Imperial broadcast about life on Tatooine. They were once again interrupted, as the Empire announced that it was imposing a curfew on the Tatoo system, effective immediately. The song that the bartender Ackmena sang to encourage her customers to leave, \"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye,\" had instrumentals very similar to \"Mad About Me,\" which were also played by the Modal Nodes. The following year, \"Mad About Me\" received a good deal of play in cantinas across Tatooine.\n\nIn 12 ABY, a bar on Nar Shaddaa owned by Reelo Baruk had \"Mad About Me\" playing as ambient music.\n\n",

Despite the anti-imperial themes in the music, Imperial Inquisitor Jerec enjoyed Borna's work, listening to the second symphony whilst reflecting aboard his flagship Vengeance in 5 ABY, feeling the piece was dark and moody. Jerec expressed remorse that Borna died prematurely, but mused that art and politics did not mix well.\n\n",

There, he had an altercation with his fellow guest Zalar Rishek, an arrogant Human of the House of Rishek, while the pair's respective entourages watched on. However, the scuffle was quickly broken up by a group of undercover Alderaanian Resistance agents.\n\nA short time later, the Gem of Alderaan was raided by Trandoshan mercenaries who sought to capture Alderaan's senator, Bail Organa and incorrectly believed Organa to be traveling on the train. Khyyynett was killed by the mercenaries during the attack, thereby cutting short his musical career.\n\n",

He was part of the touring percussion group called Shluur, a diverse ensemble composed of dozens of different species who mixed different cultural percussive rhythms. During a series of Shluur performances at Purghom Musical Performance Hall on the planet Clak'dor VII, Wurokkk became fascinated with the Bith species' brainwave patterns and began experimenting with ways to subtly influence them using rhythmic vibrations. He eventually assembled a musical piece specifically designed to provoke an aggressive reaction in Bith by subliminally affecting their biorhythms and brainwaves. The piece's performance resulted in bedlam, with audiences shouting, damaging property, and fighting; the chaos shocked the Bith public.\n\nAt the behest of the Clak'dor VII government, a group of spacers investigated the incident and discovered that the aggressive Bith had attended numerous Shluur concerts, for which Wurokkk had composed the music. Confronted with the allegation that he had caused the uproar, the composer merely expressed satisfaction that his efforts had succeeded.

This new incarnation was discovered by Jabba Desilijic Tiure's talent scout and former majordomo, who got them an audition with Jabba himself. Jabba was impressed with the Rebo Band and offered Rebo a life contract in exchange of all the food they could eat. Rebo accepted before Snootles could stop him. \"Droopy\" did not have a chance to say anything either, but he considered that it was a bad deal; he ate once a month and they had a load of chooba slugs.\n\nDuring their first night at Jabba's Palace, a Gamorrean guard noticed that McCool was a Kitonak and mentioned that he had seen other Kitonaks on the Dune Sea. He left before Droopy said anything, but this idle chat gave him something to think about.\n\n\"McCool\" was famous because he never fit in with the crowd, and because he had a quasi-mystic behavior. However, as the other courtiers on Jabba's Palace were usually busy, almost nobody paid him any attention as long as he continued with his work. He only seemed to speak with Sy Snootles.\n\nDroopy McCool was in Jabba's Palace, almost performing, when Boushh appeared with Chewbacca on 4 ABY. However, his behavior at this moment was not perceived by any of the witnesses.\n\nDroopy went with the Rebo Band on Jabba's sail barge to the Great Pit of Carkoon, and soon a large fight developed between Jabba's thugs and his victims. It was on this battle that Jabba died, ending thus the Rebo Band contract. The sail barge was suddenly unstable and the band was afraid. They did not help Jabba's minions against his enemies, although Rebo and Snootles argued about pros and cons of leaving the barge (Rebo was afraid of losing such a good contract as they had had). McCool and Snootles jumped without a second thought, and Rebo was pushed from the barge because of an accident.\n\nThey were recovering in the sand, where Snootles explained that she had a contract with Lady Valarian in mind. However, Droopy was uninterested. He was said to be hearing \"his brothers\", other Kitonaks on the Dune Sea. Rebo heard nothing and was skeptical about that, but could not convince Snit. The Kitonak left for the desert to not be seen again.\n\nYears later, some old moisture farmers said that they had heard chindinkalu flutes during the night, in the darkest corners of the desert, and others believed that it may have been Droopy and his pals playing music while waiting for the Cosmic Egg.\n\n",

They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand.\n\nOne of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter, D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside of the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley. During one of their set breaks, Figrin took the band's retainer and spent the bulk of it at the casino's sabacc tables. The other musicians grew gravely concerned. Thanks to Figrin's gambling, their chances of getting off Tatooine alive were quickly dwindling.\n\nJabba learned of the Modal Nodes breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters down to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party and a massive fire-fight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing the night when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis.

Agni was a member of the Whiplash, an anti-Imperial resistance group, and following the capture of the group's leader Thi Xon Yimmon by the Empire in about 18 BBY, Agni and several other members of the group met aboard a hovertrain on the lower levels of Coruscant, to discuss how the Whiplash would respond to Yimmon's loss. At the proposal of the Sakiyan Tuden Sal, a Whiplash Council was formed to take over the leadership of the group in Yimmon's absence, and Agni served as a member of the council. Shortly thereafter, Agni and most of her fellow Whiplash Council members perished during a botched attempt to assassinate the Imperial ruler Emperor Palpatine.\n\n",

A melancholic Kitonak, he longed for the companionship of others of his species.\n\nIt was on Orvax IV that Droopy, under the name Snit, was bought by Evar Orbus. Orbus was the lead voice of a music group, Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-Wailers, also featuring Max Rebo and Sy Snootles. However, Orbus would rather say that he \"hired\" Snit instead of buying him. Snit's belly was big enough to hide his legs, and partner Rebo was envious of what he considered a great feeding.\n\nSnootles was fond of Snit. Due to the Kitonak's natural patience, Snit could listen to the singer's complaints and thoughts for hours without saying a word, and then he would gently soothe her pains and fears. Snootles believed that it was Snit who kept the group together.\n\nOrbus got a contract with Chalmun to play music in his cantina, on Tatooine. He led the group to Tatooine, but they were met by Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, and a fight broke out between the two bands. Orbus confronted the attackers and died in the attempt, while the rest of the group ran away.\n\nThen, Snit declared that he was unsatisfied with his name and wanted a stage name. Snootles wanted to help him, until Snit chose a new name in Kitonese that even her vocal apparatus could not reproduce. She convinced him to accept the stage name she made up, \"Droopy McCool.\" His stage name was fitting, referring to his \"cool\" personality.\n\n",

They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet Rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand.\n\nOne of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off of Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley.\n\nJabba learned of the Modal Nodes' breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial Stormtroopers likewise raided the party, and a massive firefight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher, who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun, a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. Occasionally, Chalmun's night-shift manager, Ackmena, would liven the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms.\n\nShortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of sabacc. He lost the bet, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded, and the Modal Nodes went on to play the intergalactic circuit.\n\n",

Lalasha lived during the time of the Galactic Empire, an authoritarian government that rose to power in 19 BBY. The Empire was a censorial regime and began systematically hunting down, imprisoning, and executing many musicians and confiscating their music. Lalasha was targeted in one such purge by 0 BBY as a \"questionable\" individual, and the musician was subsequently executed. Following Lalasha's death, the Empire also purged records of her music.\n\nDespite the Empire's success in suppressing Lalasha's music, recordings of her work eventually came into the possession of the fugitive Devaronian war criminal Kardue'sai'Malloc, who admired Lalasha as a nigh-unparalleled Fizzz player. Once Malloc was finally caught by the bounty hunter Boba Fett in 19 ABY, the Devaronian made his captor promise to sell his music collection\u2014including the works of Lalasha\u2014to a contact, in the hope that it could be redistributed across the galaxy.\n\n",

By 22 BBY, at the time of the Clone Wars fought between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, \"All Stars Burn as One\" was still the anthem of the Republic. While the song excited the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi at one point in his life, the tense political and militaristic situations that permeated the Clone Wars eventually made hearing the song uncomfortable for him.\n\nDuring the war, around the year 22 BBY, Kenobi was sent to the prison planet Ord Cestus to prevent the sale of the Force-sensitive JK-13 security droids, which posed a significant threat to Jedi. Upon his arrival in Ord Cestus's capital, ChikatLik, a band of musician droids greeted the Knight's party with renditions of the Cestian anthem and \"All Stars Burn as One.\" The anthem was also played when a high-ranking officer or visiting dignitary would arrive at a Republic site. In 20 BBY, the anthem was played when Admiral Tarnese Bleyd arrived to inspect Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 during a battle on the planet Drongar.\n\nAt some point after the Republic became the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the Empire passed a law known as Imperial Edict 2.33b that forbade the playing of \"All Stars Burn as One.\" Around the year 12 BBY, Princess Leia Organa of the planet Alderaan tampered with the public address system during an assembly at the Collegium for Young Ladies in Crevasse City, re-programming the device to play the forbidden anthem. The incident was one of several that prompted the Collegium's Board of Directors to expel the girl from the school and return her father's 30,000 credit bond.\n\n",

Performing as Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-Wailers, Snootles and Orbus would dazzle audiences with their impressive vocal talents as Rebo and McCool accompanied them on their instruments: the Red ball organ and a chidinkalu flute.\n\nTouring small venues and cantinas in the Outer Rim, the Orbus-led group soon built up a following. The band was responsible for many hits, including \"Jedi Rocks,\" \"Lapti Nek,\" and \"(That Joyous Night) I Ate My Mate.\" Thanks to his shady contacts, however, Orbus was the only one to earn a profit.\n\nIn 15 BBY, the band played at Doodnik's Caf\u00e9 on the planet Tyne's Horky.\n\nAround 1 BBY, the band was playing at the Blue Moon, a cantina and strip club in the rundown city of Trid. Located on the backwater world of Danuta, the Blue Moon would frequently see Imperial officers from the Imperial research facility as denizens in their off hours.\n\nWhen invited to play at the Mos Eisley Cantina by the Wookiee Chalmun, the band leaped at the opportunity to gain greater fame. Unfortunately, Figrin D'an, leader of the Modal Nodes, took offense to the fact that Chalmun would hire a second band, and attempted to kill them. Orbus was the only one to perish in the ensuing melee, and the surviving members allowed the Bith to keep the job.\n\n",

        "content": "# Grondorn Muse - Biography[]\n\nA Human male, Grondorn Muse was a member of the planet Corellia's militia during the Galactic Civil War. At some point, he married a woman by the name of Duriet. He eventually left the Corellian militia, and established himself as a folk singer, famous for his songs \"Ballad of Stars' End\" and \"Those Ole Spacer's Blues,\" and for breaking out in the traditional Space Pirate Boogie to close his performances. A popular musician, the political content of his songs resulted in the Galactic Empire blacklisting him. By the year 0 BBY, Muse joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic along with Duriet.\n\nIn 0 BBY, Muse was present in the Great Temple, the Alliance's main headquarters on the moon Yavin 4. Prior to the Battle of Yavin, Muse attended a briefing held by the base's commander, General Jan Dodonna, who discussed the Alliance's plans to attack the Imperial DS-1 Orbital Battle Station superweapon after a weakness had been discovered in the battle station's thermal exhaust port. Alliance starfighters were sent to destroy the station by firing proton torpedos into its exhaust port. The battle was a major victory for the Alliance when Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker managed to successfully destroy the battlestation.\n\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin, Muse returned to Corellia. By that point, he was once again a member of the militia in the city of Bela Vistal, and he played the kloo horn in a militia band known as the Fighting 357th Serenaders. Around this time, Muse and his fellow band members went on a training exercise out in the wilds. After they returned to base, Muse discovered that he had forgotten his kloo horn. Vincol Dunker, one of his bandmates, went to retrieve the kloo horn, but he got lost in the wilderness.\n\nFortunately for Muse, he encountered a spacer who was willing to help. Muse asked the spacer to find the band member and his kloo horn, so that he would not get in trouble with his commander. The spacer agreed, and successfully set out to find Dunker, bringing him and the kloo horn safely back to Muse in Bela Vistal in return for 750 credits.\n\nHowever, Muse required more assistance from the spacer. When Dunker was brought back to Bela Vistal, he gave Muse a datadisc with a new arrangement of the popular anthem \"Corellia Ho!,\" which Muse had promised to deliver to Pytor Tuko, the band leader of the Battling 166th Troubadours. Muse had completely forgotten about the arrangement, and he could not deliver the datadisc himself, as he had to wait in town for new militia orders. Muse asked the spacer to deliver it for him, offering payment in return. After hearing Muse recite a portion of the tune, the spacer agreed to carry out the task. After finding Tuko and giving him the datadisc, the spacer returned to Muse and was awarded with 1,000 credits. Muse mentioned that the Battling 166th Troubadours could now hold their rehearsals in the wilderness, and after the task's completion, he informed the spacer that the militia situation was now under control.\n\n",

Rebo immediately accepted the offer before the others could stop him. Snootles would later comment on how foolish she had been in letting Rebo act as the public face of the band, as it had led them to virtual eternal servitude.\n\nStill, their lives were not as bad as they had once been. They were allowed to travel outside the palace and accept tips from the palace denizens. They were sent to Hoth to perform for Bingo Mehndra on the crime lord's Spawning Day. Unknown to the band, they were being sent to kill him. When McCool discovered thermite explosives hidden in the speakers, the band set up a holovid that played a previous performance for Mehndra while they made their escape. In gratitude, Jabba bought them new instruments and gave them three new band members: the Klatooinian Umpass-stay, the Weequay Ak-rev, and the Rodian bard Doda Bodonawieedo.\n\nThe band played at Jabba's Palace during Luke Skywalker's attempt to free Han Solo and later played at their execution over the Great Pit of Carkoon. The band barely escaped the catastrophe that followed, jumping to safety as the Sail Barge blew apart. Greeata and Lyn Me then drove away a band of Tusken Raiders, stealing their banthas to ride to civilization.\n\n",

        "content": "# Max Rebo - Biography[]\n\nThe male Ortolan named Siiruulian Phantele was born on his species's homeworld of Orto. As he was the smallest of five younglings, his mother feared that he would waste away. As a consequence, Phantele spent his younger years in the pursuit of food. Eventually, he ended up working in a flanth house, where he played for his dinner every night.\n\nOne day, Phantele was discovered by Evar Orbus, a crowd-pleasing Letaki wailer who was on the lookout for a young talented yet exploitable entertainer. Orbus approached Phantele, promising him that he would never need to go hungry again, provided that he signed his musical services over. Phantele's constant pursuit of food told him that this was an opportunity not to be missed. Phantele signed himself over to Orbus, and on the recommendation of his new manager, changed his name to Max Rebo. Shortly after, the Max Rebo Band was formed. Rebo played the red ball organ.\n\nAt some point during the Clone Wars, Rebo attended a VIP gala held by Bezz Drexx on Coruscant. He found the reception boring, however, and he spent time off to the side of the crowd, with his hands in the pockets of his tuxedo.\n\nIn 3 ABY, Evar Orbus was killed by Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, because the band came to Tatooine to take their job at the Mos Eisley Cantina. This was when Sy Snootles encouraged Rebo to take lead of the musical group. Snootles, however, discreetly controlled the band herself, letting na\u00efve Rebo take the credit as frontman. She did this in order to avoid becoming the target of those that the band might\u2014and most likely would\u2014potentially anger.\n\nSnootles' plan had terrible repercussions for the band however, when Rebo signed the entire band over to Jabba Desilijic Tiure with a lifelong contract including an unlimited supply of food.\n\nThe band was confined to performing in Jabba's Palace, until Jabba died at the hands of Leia Organa and the Rebels. After Jabba was killed, he went on tour with Sy since his other band member Droopy left to find his brothers in the desert. After Sy set off on her own, Rebo set out on his own solo career, and after many tours, joined the Rebel Alliance to entertain soldiers.\n\nHe eventually left the music industry, and opened his own chain of restaurants: Max's Flangth House. He became quite rich, and finally settled on Coruscant.\n\n",

Between jobs, however, Lirin would find time to perform as a backup player for the Modal Nodes.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes had entered into an exclusive contract with the Tatooine crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand.\n\nOne of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off of Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside of the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley.\n\nJabba learned of the Modal Nodes' breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters down to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party, and a massive firefight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher, who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. At least once, Chalmun's night-shift manager, Ackmena, livened the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms. However, Car'n was not present for this performance.\n\nShortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of sabacc. He lost the bet, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded, and the Modal Nodes went on to play the intergalactic circuit.\n\n",

This antiquity garnered respect in certain quarters, such as among the Gree, who gave them more respect than other, \"younger\" species. Their society was highly regimented, with everything from mate selection to political leadership controlled by sophisticated computer programs.\n\nMade easily accessible to the Galactic Republic circa 5500 BBY with the blazing of the Rimma Trade Route, the Bith were moving around the galaxy by the time of the Great Sith War, as their homeworld was in a part of space greatly explored by the Republic at that time. Considered part of the civilized galaxy by the time of the Jedi Civil War, the Bith homeworld was located in space controlled by the Brotherhood of Darkness during the Republic Dark Age. When the Republic recovered following the Ruusan Reformation, the Bith became a vocal voice in the Galactic Senate, gaining a seat in the Senate Building on Coruscant.\n\nCirca 300 BBY, the Bith city-states of Nozho and Weogar engaged in a massive civil war using biological weapons over patent rights to a new hyperdrive. The aftermath of the Nozho\u2013Weogar War destroyed Clak'dor VII's ecosystem and crippled the Bith industrial capacity, forcing the Bith to retreat to sealed cities and rely on imported goods and machinery to keep their society functioning. The Y'bith, a subspecies of Bith, were descended from Bith whose genetic code was altered in the aftermath of a biological attack on Nozho. These \"ghost Bith\" resettled on Clak'dor IV and developed their own society, somewhat estranged from the Bith mainstream.\n\nThe war also brought out a strong pacifistic streak in Bith culture, electing vocal Senate members who pushed for galactic disarmament. While they attempted to remain neutral during the Separatist Crisis they were eventually coerced into supporting the Confederacy of Independent Systems against the Republic by Confederate leader Count Dooku. Both the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire made the Bith uneasy about conditions in the rest of the galaxy, with most Bith choosing to wait out the dark times within Clak'dor VII's sealed cities. After the Clone Wars, the Bith did not resist the Empire, instead putting their technical expertise at the service of the Imperial war machine. The Bith were horrified by the Empire, however, and were among the first species to be liberated from the Eriadu Authority by the New Republic in 5 ABY. The Bith did not emerge fully from their isolation until 8 ABY, shortly after the Hapans rejoined the Galactic community. A Republic stronghold during the Thrawn campaign, the Bith homeworld would go on to avoid invasion by the Yuuzhan Vong.\n\n",

        "content": "# Lirin Car'n - Biography[]\n\nLirin wasn't always a musician. Prior to taking up the kloo horn, he worked as a mercenary and was a close associate of the Abyssin known as Myo. Between jobs, however, Lirin would find time to perform as a backup player for the Modal Nodes.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes had entered into an exclusive contract with the Tatooine crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand.\n\nOne of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off of Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside of the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley.\n\nJabba learned of the Modal Nodes' breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters down to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party, and a massive firefight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher, who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. At least once, Chalmun's night-shift manager, Ackmena, livened the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms. However, Car'n was not present for this performance.\n\nShortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of sabacc. He lost the bet, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded, and the Modal Nodes went on to play the intergalactic circuit.\n\n",

Others used their intelligence, natural technical skills, and dexterity to work in the criminal underworld. Many Bith worked as cantina staff, since bartenders in Bith society held a position equivalent in many ways to priests in other cultures. The Intelligence Quartermaster for Imperial Intelligence during the Cold War was a Bith stationed on the Imperial Fleet. At the same time, Unaw Aharo was a Bith Jedi Knight during escalating war between the Republic and Sith Empire. Their hearing also made Bith such as Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, the house band in the Mos Eisley Cantina circa 0 BBY, excellent musicians.\n\nBith had a longstanding tradition of sending their Force-sensitive members to join the Jedi Order. Aside from Jedi Aharo during the Cold War, Ph'ton served as a Jedi Master during the Clone Wars and a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. Many other Bith had served the Order as Jedi Consulars over the years; some of them were rumored to have survived the Great Jedi Purge by hiding on their homeworld.\n\nNot all Force-sensitive Bith served the Jedi, however. Rugess Nome was taken as a member of the Order of the Sith Lords and eventually named Darth Tenebrous. In 67 BBY, while Tenebrous and his apprentice, Darth Plagueis, were stationed on the planet Bal'demnic, Plagueis killed the Bith Sith Lord, stating that he planned to overthrow the Rule of Two, establishing a new order of his own, that would stay for a thousand years under his control.\n\n",

Despite having no prior experience in dance, the possibility of being fed to the beast motivated Mina to learn quickly and she became quite adept in the art. Mina's dedication to her studies was quite strong; even when she was enslaved as Jabba's personal dancer, she continued to write her thesis on Hutt anthropology, even incorporating her personal experiences of enslavement into the paper. This eventually paid off, as her work was eventually recognized across the galaxy and she was often asked to give lectures on the subject.\n\n",

Lacking sufficient funds to complete her required years of study, she toured the galaxy as the lead singer with an unnamed band to pay for her tuition as well as to work on her thesis.\n\nEventually, her band was offered a chance to play for the intergalactic crimelord Jabba the Hutt in his palace on Tatooine. Despite being wary of Jabba's reputation, the band accepted, believing they could be cautious enough to avoid any unpleasant business.\n\nThe band eventually arrived on Tatooine and began their contract. During one of their performances, Mina witnessed another Twi'lek girl defy Jabba which lead to her being fed to his pet rancor, an experience that greatly disturbed her.\n\nAfter their contract was completed Jabba refused to pay the band for their services, leaving them broke and with no means of travel. The band resorted to selling Mina to Jabba as a slave for funds to book transport off-world and Mina remained in Jabba's service. Her primary duties consisted of attending to Jabba and entertaining him, as she was forced to dance for Jabba as well as clean him. During her captivity, Mina continued working on her thesis, using her experiences in the palace as inspiration in the hope that she would someday be able to escape and publish it.\n\nWhen Oola first arrived at the palace, Mina noticed Jabba was already becoming enamored with the new Twi'lek. She began to fear for her own life, since she remembered how easily she herself had replaced Jabba's previous dancer after she had been fed to the rancor. That night, Mina managed to cut the chain that bound her to Jabba using a nail file and attempted to escape with many of the notes she had taken. However, when she came to the palace gates, she encountered Tamtel Skreej, one of Jabba's guards. Fearful at first, Mina told Skreej he didn't need to call for the other guards and that she would return to Jabba's side willingly, but was surprised when he stood aside and allowed her to escape. She thanked him as the gates closed and left the palace. She eventually managed to find passage off-world, returning to and then graduating from her University as a scholar of Hutt culture and became a celebrated lecturer on the subject. Her thesis was published under the name \"Hygiene & Power: A Xenopological Study of a Hutt.\"\n\n",

They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand.\n\nOne of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter, D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off of Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside of the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley.\n\nJabba learned of the Modal Nodes breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters down to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party and a massive fire-fight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing the night when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. Occasionally, Chalmun's nightshift manager, Ackmena, would liven the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms.\n\nShortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of sabacc. He lost the bet, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded and the Modal Nodes went on to play the intergalactic circuit.\n\n",

He and Domo fall in love with a Twi'lek waitress of the Mos Zabu cantina named JillJoo Jab. Around the same time, Blerx toured on Dantooine and Orto. Some time later, Domo Jones decided to help the Alliance to Restore the Republic by sabotaging an Imperial purchase of Nergon-14 proton torpedoes from the criminal Ep Gart. He therefore enlisted the help of Blerx, JillJoo Jab and the protocol droid UR-1. The four successfully foiled the Imperial plot by causing a herd of nerfs to stampede the location of the sale.\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Blerx Tango and the Dewback Ramblers operated out of the Lucky Star cantina in Mos Entha. Tango was the leader of the band and played kloo horn.\n\nIn 1 ABY, he learned that a fellow band member named Jakko Mixon got stranded in the desert. Jakko had fallen for an old trick, a scam where he believed he would get a cheap ride to Bestine. Fortunately, Blerx managed to employ the help of a spacer, who sought out to find Jakko, and bring him back safely to Mos Entha. However, the troubles had not yet ended for Blerx's band members. His Ithorian ommni box player, Mellaw Doowon, needed to be escorted back safely after making some bad jokes with Imperial authorities. Once again, the spacer was tasked to find Mellaw, and bring him back to Blerx. Unfortunately for the spacer, a stormtrooper would not let Mellaw be escorted back. The stormtrooper opened fire, forcing the spacer to kill the trooper. Yet the ordeals were not yet over. Another band member, Baze Joz, ended up biting an agent from the Imperial Security Bureau. Committed, the spacer sought out Baze Joz, so that he too could be brought back to Jakko. When the spacer approached Baze, he was attacked by three Imperial sergeants. The three sergeants were ultimately dispatched by the spacer, allowing him to bring Baze home safely. In addition to the credits that Blerx provided the spacer, he was also awarded a nalargon for his service.\n\n",

The experiment succeeded when, after a week of performances, some Bith who had attended the Shluur concerts began shouting and damaging property, with one even throwing a datapad at another. The violence eventually grew into riots that almost leveled the planetary capital of Weogar.\n\nThe resulting aggression from the Bith caused their shocked government to investigate Wurokkk.

        "content": "# Augara Jowil - Biography[]\n\nAugara Jowil, or \"Augie\" as she was known, had been raised in Naboo's Lianorm Swamp region. She demonstrated significant talent as a musikagung at an early age, and was hailed as a prodigy. Jowil was sent by her parents to Otoh Gunga, where she studied for many years under Great Municipal Band leader Beezar Pert, composer of the famed \"Symponika Crunchen-Grand,\" which chronicled the original formation of the Gungan Grand Army. Jowil was among the first to hear the \"Symponika Crunchen-Grand.\" After finishing Jowil's instruction, Pert retired, and the members of the band unanimously voted in his young pupil as his successor, despite her youth and inexperience.\n\nIn her new role, Jowil never believed that she would be given the opportunity to chronicle anything as significant as the formation of the Gungan Grand Army. In 32 BBY, Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation, forcing Boss Rugor Nass to evacuate Otoh Gunga. Jowil joined Nass and the Reps at the Sacred Place some time after the evacuation, and was there to witness Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, leader of the Human population on Naboo, present herself before Nass in a bid to forge an alliance against the Federation. Nass agreed, and prepared to send the Gungan Grand Army to fight the invaders. Jowil was stunned by the humility and respect of Amidala and her Human entourage, and she realized that what she had just seen would be a watershed moment in Naboo's history.\n\nWith a fitting subject now at hand, Jowil set about composing, in her head, a piece that would chronicle what she had just seen. In a matter of days, she had composed the \"Symponik Nabooalla,\" an epic for all of Naboo's denizens chronicling the Gungans' and Humans' collaborative efforts at restoring their freedom. The first movement of the piece debuted during a large parade in Theed following the Battle of Naboo, in which Humans and Gungans alike had overcome the armies of the Federation. Among those present were Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and members of the Jedi Council, in addition to Queen Amidala and Boss Nass. The exposure that the piece received was unprecedented, cementing Jowil's place in history as one of the Great Municipal Band's most significant leaders.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the rebelling Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jowil, along with several other prominent Naboo musicians, coaxed Beezar Pert out of retirement for a special concert in the Palace Plaza of Theed to honor the orphans of both Republic and Separatist forces.\n\n",

        "content": "# Tedn Dahai - Biography[]\n\nTedn wasn't always a musician. Prior to taking up the fanfar, he was employed as a scout for the Imperial Navy. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, however, Tedn abandoned this field and committed himself to music full time.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes had entered into an exclusive contract with the Tatooine crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. They would routinely perform in the courts at Jabba's Palace and his Mos Eisley townhouse, but it didn't take long before they all regretted entering into a contract with the Hutt. Recognizing Jabba's penchant for executing underlings that displeased him at a moment's notice, the Modal Nodes began to fear for their lives. It would only be a matter of time before Jabba decided to make a snack of the musicians, by tossing one down into the dungeon abode of his pet rancor. Fortunately for them, a golden opportunity was fresh at hand.\n\nOne of Jabba's rivals, a Whiphid named Lady Valarian, offered the band 3,000 credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid hunter D'Wopp. Figrin decided that the fast money would enable them to get off of Tatooine and out from under the thumb of Jabba the Hutt. They arrived at the Star Chamber Caf\u00e9 reception hall inside the Lucky Despot Hotel & Casino in Mos Eisley.\n\nJabba learned of the Modal Nodes' breach of contract and sent several of his bounty hunters to the casino to disrupt the festivities. As luck would have it, Imperial stormtroopers likewise raided the party, and a massive firefight broke out. During the confusion, the Modal Nodes met a party guest named Wuher, who showed them a quick way out. Wuher put in a good word for them with Chalmun\u2014a Wookiee who owned a nearby cantina where Wuher tended bar. Chalmun hired the Modal Nodes to play a couple of gigs at his bar, the following evening. They were performing when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the cantina seeking a pilot willing to ferry them to the Alderaan system. They continued to perform at Chalmun's on a regular basis. Occasionally, Chalmun's night-shift manager, Ackmena, would liven the bar's atmosphere by singing along with the Modal Nodes' rhythms.\n\nShortly after this event, Figrin D'an wagered the band's instruments and equipment on a hand of sabacc. He lost the bet, but the Modal Nodes soon convinced him to win their equipment back. He eventually succeeded, and the Modal Nodes went on to play the intergalactic circuit.\n\n",

Once the song ended, Jabba ordered Oola to repeat her performance, but thinking that the Hutt was giving orders to the band, the singer Joh Yowza shouted for them to start playing again.\n\nAfter stopping the Growdi Harmonique player Rappertunie from starting a different song, Yowza had the band play \"Jedi Rocks.\" Leaning back as he blew into the kloo horn, Barquin stood beside the Rodian bandmember Doda Bodonawieedo as the song went on, although the performance was abruptly interrupted when Jabba dropped Oola through a trap door after the dancer refused his advances. With the music ended, other members of the court rushed forward to watch through a grate in the floor as Oola was devoured by Jabba's pet rancor, Pateesa, in a pit below the throne room.\n\n",

He needed money to leave the planet, so Barquin had to look for a new job and found one\u2014in Jabba's Palace. The atmosphere wasn't his taste at all and instead of earning money for performing with the Max Rebo Band, he was enslaved by the Hutt crimelord. Without any possibility to escape, he tried to find a way to kill himself. His opportunity came, when Jabba left his palace with the Khetanna to feed Luke Skywalker and his companions to the Great Pit of Carkoon. Barquin waited for an opportunity to jump into the sarlacc's maw, but when the skirmish broke out, he escaped into the Dune Sea. He headed towards Mos Eisley and hid on a cargo barge to Stenos. There, he built up an import/export business and became quite successful with it.\n\n",

On every illicit release of the banned album, it was completely sold out.\n\nOne of his most well know tours was trough the Outer Rim Territories, where he and \"Hyperspaze and the Jump Lanes\" performed at several key Rebel Alliance safe-worlds for the enjoyment of the stationed troops and refugees that made their living there.\n\nHe was also counted amongst his many acquaintances, the Bimm bard Vasnish Kay and the Ewok shaman Keoulkeech.\n\n",

While the four performed, Kanata spotted the smuggler Han Solo entering the establishment, and yelled to him, causing the band to fall silent. They then resumed their playing, but were soon disturbed again when many of the castle's residents rushed out to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon.

The human child Temmin Wexley played the shanty on his family's valachord with his father Brentin Lore Wexley. After his father was captured by the Galactic Empire and his mother Norra Wexley left to fight with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Temmin used the valachord as part of an opening mechanism for a secret door beneath his home leading to a series of passages under the city Myrra. For the door to open, the first five notes of \"The Shanty of Cart and Cobble\" had to be played on the valachord.\n\n",
