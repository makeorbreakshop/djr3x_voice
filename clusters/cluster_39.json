In 19 BBY, the Clone Wars ended with the Separatists' defeat and the Republic's reformation into the Galactic Empire. With the end of the war, the Separatist battle droids were decommissioned, and the tactical droid was set to be destroyed at a decommissioning facility on the planet Corellia in that same year.\n\nThe droid was to be saved from its fate, however; with the Republic's clone troopers now serving the Empire, the intelligence tactical droids possessed regarding how to defeat them became valuable. Two parties sought to retrieve a tactical droid from Corellia before the Separatist droids were destroyed: Clone Force 99, a squad of rogue clone commandos operating as mercenaries for the information broker Ciddarin Scaleback; and Trace and Rafa Martez, sisters working on behalf of former Clone Captain Rex, who wished to use the droid's data to resist the Empire.\n\nIn the facility, the tactical droid\u2014partially disassembled, with its head detached but intact\u2014was off-loaded onto the north end conveyor and sent on its way to be melted down. By the time that Clone Force 99 entered the facility, the tactical droid was the last such droid remaining, the others of its model already having been destroyed. After the clone Omega had located the droid, Trace retrieved its head and ran, encountering the troopers Echo and Tech as well as the squad's leader, Hunter. The intruders were soon discovered by the workers, who locked down the facility and dispatched Imperial Police Droids.\n\n",

However, when the facility was rebooted by the clone Wrecker and the conveyors began to move, Omega tripped and dropped the head, with Trace stealing it back. Trace soon returned to help save Omega, who had become trapped on the conveyor.\n\nThe two groups decided to put aside the fight for the tactical droid and work together to escape the facility. Wishing for a diversion, Trace intended to reprogram the tactical droid to command the deactivated Separatist droids. When Omega activated the droid, however, it was unable to transmit and powered down. Tech assisted by boosting the signal, also attaching a data rod to download the droid's intelligence, and the tactical droid reactivated. Following Trace's order, the tactical droid commanded the battle droids to target the police droids.

By the second year of the war, the T-series tactical droids began getting phased out by their successors. The T-series still had its place, mostly commanding small fleets and other non-essential missions. Meanwhile, the super tactical droids replaced the T-series on the most critical missions that required a tactical droid.\n\nIn 20 BBY, Separatist leader, Count Dooku dispatched one such droid, General Kalani, to assist King Sanjay Rash's forces in dealing with the rebels of Onderon. During this time, he worked alongside the Royal Militia's commander, General Akenathen Tandin, as they attempted to capture the rebels in Iziz, which included overseeing the brutal torture of one of the rebel leaders. However, Tandin and his forces then defected and assisted the rebels in freeing Ramsis Dendup during their escape to the highlands. When the rebels were able to defeat the droid gunships, Kalani was then ordered to retreat with his forces to Agamar, despite Rash's objections. Kalani then executed Rash.\n\nAnother super tactical droid, Aut-O was stationed aboard a Providence-class Dreadnought. However, he was destroyed by R2-D2. Another one was given command of a commandeered Venator-class Star Destroyer with the mission to destroy the Republic strategy conference on Valor station in the Carida system. However, when the buzz droids failed in stopping D-Squad, the super tactical droid and it's crew were destroyed before they were able to complete their mission.\n\nAnother super tactical droid, Kraken, served as second-in-command to Admiral Trench. Kraken then attempted to take a captured clone trooper CT-5385 to Count Dooku. However, he was stopped by General Skywalker and two of his 501st Legion troopers; Clone Captain Rex and ARC trooper Fives. The trio quickly destroyed Kraken's droid guard. After Kraken told Skywalker he was programmed to resist intimidation, the Jedi decapitated Kraken for his refusal to answer his questions. However, he was then rebuilt and commanded the Separatist forces during the invasion of Scipio alongside Dooku. Kraken continued to serve under Dooku aboard his command ship, even when his master, Lord Sidious, demanded his presence.\n\nA super tactical droid then accompanied General Grievous to Utapau aboard a Separatist supply ship to secure the shipment of a enormous kyber crystal. However, it was destroyed when the Jedi's top members intervened.\n\nAnother super tactical droid served Admiral Trench during the Battle of Anaxes. the droid was stationed on the bridge of Trench's dreadnought, where they and the Admiral oversaw the attack on Anaxes's Assembly Complex. The droid was destroyed when Anakin Skywalker stormed the bridge of the ship to get the last sequence from Admiral Trench for a bomb hidden in the plant's fusion reactor.\n\n",

In the second year of the Clone Wars, due to the inflexible and predictable deficiencies of the T-series model, the ST-series super tactical droid was produced by Baktoid Combat Automata for the Confederacy of Independent Systems and its military branch as a solution. Programmed with higher strategical processing and intelligence, while also equipped with better tactical analysis and predicting a response to organic commanders, super tactical droids were utilized by the Separatists as masterful battlefield commanders, often filling the role of commander or general, including Commanders Aut-O and Kraken, as well as Generals Kalani and Linwodo, the former of which served directly under Separatist Head of State Count Dooku. Although they saw frequent deployment throughout the Separatist military, the T-series model still saw utilization by the Confederacy, commanding small fleet groups on non-essential missions, while prime objectives and operations were proceeded to super tactical droids.\n\nTaller than their forebears by a single centimeter, the ST-series units were constructed with superior armor plating than that of the T-series, and were also equipped with additional systems, such as greater heat ventilation, magnatomic grip panels which allowed them to use organic equipment, and an additional third photoreceptor. Super tactical droids were also granted by their superior officers to a form of individuality within the Separatist military. Their given individuality thereby granted the droid model the ability to customize their entire bodies with color schemes in order to distinguish themselves. To an even greater extent, some units of the ST-series had also developed personalities of sorts, with several, such as Kalani, foregoing their identification numbers and creating names for themselves in refusal to respond to their numbers.\n\n",

        "content": "# ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid - Design[]\n\nIn response to the T-series tactical droid's inflexibility, the secessionist Confederacy of Independent Systems commissioned the battle droid manufacturer, Baktoid Combat Automata, to produce the ST-series super tactical droid for use in its military forces during the galaxy-spanning conflict known as the Clone Wars between itself and the dominant Galactic Republic. These enhanced tactical droids improved on their predecessors' shortcomings and were better at predicting how organic commanders would respond to events. They also had a status indicator for their central processing hubs. The super tactical droids had a total of three photoreceptors, which gave them sight to a large range of the light spectrum.\n\nThe ST-series stood at 1.94 meters or 6 feet, 4 inches in height. Despite being just one centimeter taller than their predecessor, they managed to seem far bigger, dominating a room with an arrogantly assured presence that the boxy T-series never managed. ST-series units were constructed with superior armor plating than that of the T-series, particularly on the limbs. The palms and inner surface of their improved hands were fitted with magnatomic grip panels, which allowed them to pick up and use most weapons, tools and equipment made for organic beings, without dropping them. The ST-series tougher armor and neck joints were not the super tactical droids' only updates over their predecessors. They also had greater heating ventilation than their predecessors. Although they retained heat sinks in their abdomen, super tactical droids had additional ventilation holes in their armor\non the sides of their chest units, just below the shoulder joints. Their extra processing power resulted in additional heat production by their complex computers.\n\nThe ST-series were better built than the T-series and their vocoders had a more threatening robotic voice than their predecessors. Super tactical droids also developed their own personalities. Some of them, such as General Kalani, gave themselves names instead of numbers. They also often chose their own personalized color schemes and decorations for their armored bodies, with Kalani choosing ornate gold trims to his armor, while Kraken went for a swirling pattern of gold on his green armor.\n\nSuper tactical droids were programmed to serve as generals and admirals in the Separatist war machine. They were ruthless and calculating leaders but were still arrogant and overconfident like earlier tactical droid models. They were also argumentative and operated without sympathy or morality, executing ruthless strategies.\n\nThe super tactical droids possessed more advanced processors than the T-series, which enabled them to be far more capable of calculating tactics and countermoves that could challenge their Republic opponents. They were also able to react far more quickly to unexpected events. Overall, they were a far more dangerous foe than the T-series, matching the military acumen of even some experienced CIS generals.\n\nDifferences aside, the super tactical droid, as with their counterpart in the Separatist Droid Army, was analytical and calculating. Created to digest a situation of battle and formulate the most effective solution with a time frame for its execution, they were dreaded by Republic soldiers and seen as very dangerous to veteran officers.\n\n",

        "content": "# ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid - Performance[]\n\nServing as masterful commanders of the Droid Army, the super tactical droid was highly intelligent and strategic, bane to both the Jedi Order and the Republic Military.\n\nYet where given the independence to act, super tactical droids could direct Confederacy military operations without superior overseers. Programmed with Separatist beliefs, they conquered through fear and the lack of courage and hope in their opponents, fighting for what they presumed as \"freedom from the tyranny of the Republic.\" Prioritizing Confederate success, the super tactical droid would not hesitate utilizing threats and torture as means of interrogation. The super tactical droids themselves were resistant to interrogation. They also had more enhanced strategic programming over their predecessors, and they had more fluid motion programming than the T-series.\n\nWhile the T-series thought of themselves as superior to their battle droids, super tactical droids had complete faith in their own abilities, to the extent they also believed themselves to better than the majority of the organic beings they served. This was partially because the super tactical droids became accustomed to commanding dull witted battle droids. The droids' faith in their abilities did give the super tactical droids the clear conscience to make sacrifices to assure victory, even if it meant the loss of allied organic troops and commanders. However, it also meant they would argue a point with anyone. The droids were completely loyal to the CIS leadership and the values of the Separatists. This often created an unforeseen issue when coupled with their arrogant sense of self-superiority. While the processor deficiencies of the T-series made them predictable, the super tactical droids were so convinced that they were right that they would dismiss data and tactical options that did not conform to their choices. Despite this failing, the super tactical droids remained a significant threat to the Republic.\n\nAlthough super tactical droids were not designed for the purpose of direct involvement in combat, they were capable of self-defense and equipped with the standard Droid Army E-5 blaster rifle, or a melee weapon. They had advanced combat programming and were also less inclined to flee a confrontation than the T-series. They also weren't above engaging in hand-to-hand combat, even being willing to do so against Jedi on one occasion.\n\n",

Despite their programming, mechanical beings developed personality quirks and eventually sentience; however, this was suppressed through memory wipes, a process opposed by those in support of droid rights, who advocated for sentient rights for droids and raised the point of the Galactic Empire's Galactic Constitution declaring that all sentients were equal, and that slavery and forced servitude was outlawed.

With the end of the war, the Separatist battle droids were decommissioned, and the tactical droid was set to be destroyed at a decommissioning facility on the planet Corellia in that same year.\n\nThe droid was to be saved from its fate, however; with the Republic's clone troopers now serving the Empire, the intelligence tactical droids possessed regarding how to defeat them became valuable. Two parties sought to retrieve a tactical droid from Corellia before the Separatist droids were destroyed: Clone Force 99, a squad of rogue clone commandos operating as mercenaries for the information broker Ciddarin Scaleback; and Trace and Rafa Martez, sisters working on behalf of former Clone Captain Rex, who wished to use the droid's data to resist the Empire.\n\nIn the facility, the tactical droid\u2014partially disassembled, with its head detached but intact\u2014was off-loaded onto the north end conveyor and sent on its way to be melted down. By the time that Clone Force 99 entered the facility, the tactical droid was the last such droid remaining, the others of its model already having been destroyed. After the clone Omega had located the droid, Trace retrieved its head and ran, encountering the troopers Echo and Tech as well as the squad's leader, Hunter.

However, when the facility was rebooted by the clone Wrecker and the conveyors began to move, Omega tripped and dropped the head, with Trace stealing it back.

When Omega activated the droid, however, it was unable to transmit and powered down. Tech assisted by boosting the signal, also attaching a data rod to download the droid's intelligence, and the tactical droid reactivated. Following Trace's order, the tactical droid commanded the battle droids to target the police droids.

After the end of the war and the formation of the Galactic Empire, the Separatist battle droids were decommissioned, and the rogue clone squad Clone Force 99, as well as sisters Trace and Rafa Martez, both attempted to retrieve the T-series tactical droid for its intelligence before it was destroyed at a facility on the planet Corellia. The two groups briefly competed to secure the droid's detached head, but eventually worked together against the facility's police droids, reactivating the tactical droid to set the battle droids against their opponents. The tactical droid's head was destroyed during the skirmish, but the clones' leader, Hunter, ultimately gave a data rod containing its intelligence to the Martez sisters in order to fight the Empire.\n\n",

A TranLang III communications module allowed them to be fluent in over six million forms of communication, even if they could not respond in all of them for a lack of proper communication appendages. They also had the skills necessary to quickly analyze new unregistered languages and translate them into more well-known ones.\n\nThey were even provided with an olfactory sensor that allowed them to comprehend pheromonal communication. Other useful features were a factory-standard restraining bolt mount, and the fact that their shutdown switch was conveniently located at the back of their neck, on a very easy to reach place.\n\nSome models, such as the pricey E-3POs, also included the TechSpan I module, making it possible to interface with Imperial networks and undocumented technologies of Imperial subcontractors.\n\n",

The droid traveled with Sunrider and his wife Nomi in Andur's starship, the Lightside Explorer, where his primary function was to keep the ship in working order. A-3DO performed several other functions, including the playing of music on a mandolin, but most often spent his time doting on the Sunriders and worrying about their safety when not maintaining the ship. The droid considered the Sunriders to be his family, and insisted upon being referred to in the more colloquial form, ThreeDee.\n\nWhen Andur received an invitation from the Jedi Master Chamma\u2014a friend of Andur's grandfather, Jev Sunrider\u2014to study the Force under him on the planet H'ratth, ThreeDee accompanied his masters. While on the planet, Nomi bore a daughter, Vima. Soon thereafter, Master Chamma decided that he could no longer instruct Andur in the the ways of the Jedi, and instructed his apprentice to travel to Ambria, in the Stenness system, where he would complete his training under the Tchuukthai Jedi Master, Thon. Chamma gave Andur several Adegan crystals\u2014quite useful in the construction of lightsabers\u2014to bring to his new master as gifts. Before they could leave, however, A-3DO had to replace an ion exciter in order to render the Lightside Explorer's hyperdrive functional. Once again, A-3DO found himself traveling to another planet with the Sunriders.\n\nThe Lightside Explorer arrived in the Stenness system, where it stopped at a hyperspace terminal for service and customs inspection. ThreeDee and the Sunriders left the ship to have a look around the station, but soon came under attack by thugs in Bogga the Hutt's gang, who had overheard Andur mentioning the Adegan crystals to Nomi; the brutes took the droid hostage as a diversion. When Andur confronted the gang members, one of them threw a gorm-worm at Andur; the small creature bit Sunrider, killing him almost instantly. Nomi, quite unexpectedly, took up her fallen husband's lightsaber, defending Vima and ThreeDee, and drove off the bandits, much to ThreeDee's gratitude. The trio quickly made their escape in the Lightside Explorer and set course for Ambria.\n\n",

The Hutt gangster, who coveted the Adegan crystals, had decided to take his sail barge and gang to Ambria in pursuit of Nomi. ThreeDee's arm was blown off, and the ship ransacked.\n\nAfter yet another confrontation with Bogga's thugs at the home of Thon, whom she had finally located, Nomi returned to the vessel with the Jedi Oss Wilum, another of Thon's students, and retrieved A-3DO. Wilum took it upon himself to repair the damage done to ThreeDee, but was delayed for several months due to a shortage of parts. Eventually Wilum completed his work on the droid\u2014as well as his training under Thon\u2014and left Ambria to join a group of Jedi Knights who were sent to help quell the Freedon Nadd Uprising on the planet Onderon.\n\nA-3DO remained with his mistress and Vima on Ambria as Nomi Sunrider continued her training under Master Thon, assisting her and helping to look after Vima. Eventually, more of Bogga's minions, this time led by a pirate named Finhead Stonebone, came in search of the Adegan crystals, but Nomi and Thon ultimately managed to drive them off, due primarily to Nomi's natural talent with battle meditation.\n\n",

As a 3DO Protocol/Service Droid, A-3DO was possessed of a variety of skills, from programming to bureaucracy and cultures. He served in more domestic functions, as well, such as serving the Sunriders with refreshments, looking after Vima, and playing the mandolin. Although he possessed some ability with languages, the droid could only produce sound in the range of Human speech, and had similar limitations with his auditory and visual sensors.\n\nThe most important of ThreeDee's functions, however, was the maintenance of the Lightside Explorer. He sat in the copilot's seat, communicating with the vessel's systems\u2014such as the sensors, the navigation computer, and the hyperdrive\u2014frequently, relating any pertinent information to the pilot. In addition to his communication abilities, ThreeDee was built with advanced fine-motor circuitry and servos to facilitate ease of repair work. However, he possessed no knowledge of droid maintenance, and was unable to repair himself, as was evidenced when Oss Wilum had to put ThreeDee back together following the attack by Bogga's henchmen.\n\nThreeDee was a very doting and conscientious droid, frequently worrying about his safety, as well as that of his charges. On Ambria, he quickly sensed the danger of blowing sand, hinting to Nomi that perhaps he should not accompany her on her journey through the desert. After being attacked, ThreeDee was particularly sensitive, asking Oss Wilum about his repairs, worried that he might be rendered inoperable. However, the droid looked after Nomi and Vima, as well, alerting them to a path of escape during an attack by pirates.\n\n",

In the second year of the Clone Wars, due to the inflexible and predictable deficiencies of the T-series model, the ST-series super tactical droid was produced by Baktoid Combat Automata for the Confederacy of Independent Systems and its military branch as a solution. Programmed with higher strategical processing and intelligence, while also equipped with better tactical analysis and predicting a response to organic commanders, super tactical droids were utilized by the Separatists as masterful battlefield commanders, often filling the role of commander or general, including Commanders Aut-O and Kraken, as well as Generals Kalani and Linwodo, the former of which served directly under Separatist Head of State Count Dooku. Although they saw frequent deployment throughout the Separatist military, the T-series model still saw utilization by the Confederacy, commanding small fleet groups on non-essential missions, while prime objectives and operations were proceeded to super tactical droids.\n\nTaller than their forebears by a single centimeter, the ST-series units were constructed with superior armor plating than that of the T-series, and were also equipped with additional systems, such as greater heat ventilation, magnatomic grip panels which allowed them to use organic equipment, and an additional third photoreceptor. Super tactical droids were also granted by their superior officers to a form of individuality within the Separatist military. Their given individuality thereby granted the droid model the ability to customize their entire bodies with color schemes in order to distinguish themselves. To an even greater extent, some units of the ST-series had also developed personalities of sorts, with several, such as Kalani, foregoing their identification numbers and creating names for themselves in refusal to respond to their numbers.\n\n",

Programmed with Separatist beliefs, they conquered through fear and the lack of courage and hope in their opponents, fighting for what they presumed as \"freedom from the tyranny of the Republic.\" Prioritizing Confederate success, the super tactical droid would not hesitate utilizing threats and torture as means of interrogation. The super tactical droids themselves were resistant to interrogation. They also had more enhanced strategic programming over their predecessors, and they had more fluid motion programming than the T-series.\n\nWhile the T-series thought of themselves as superior to their battle droids, super tactical droids had complete faith in their own abilities, to the extent they also believed themselves to better than the majority of the organic beings they served. This was partially because the super tactical droids became accustomed to commanding dull witted battle droids. The droids' faith in their abilities did give the super tactical droids the clear conscience to make sacrifices to assure victory, even if it meant the loss of allied organic troops and commanders. However, it also meant they would argue a point with anyone. The droids were completely loyal to the CIS leadership and the values of the Separatists. This often created an unforeseen issue when coupled with their arrogant sense of self-superiority. While the processor deficiencies of the T-series made them predictable, the super tactical droids were so convinced that they were right that they would dismiss data and tactical options that did not conform to their choices. Despite this failing, the super tactical droids remained a significant threat to the Republic.\n\nAlthough super tactical droids were not designed for the purpose of direct involvement in combat, they were capable of self-defense and equipped with the standard Droid Army E-5 blaster rifle, or a melee weapon. They had advanced combat programming and were also less inclined to flee a confrontation than the T-series. They also weren't above engaging in hand-to-hand combat, even being willing to do so against Jedi on one occasion.\n\n",

        "content": "# ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid - Clone Wars[]\n\nAlthough at least one super tactical droid was active during the early days of the Clone Wars, the model only grew to become more common as the conflict carried on because of the failings of the T-series. By the second year of the war, the T-series tactical droids began getting phased out by their successors. The T-series still had its place, mostly commanding small fleets and other non-essential missions. Meanwhile, the super tactical droids replaced the T-series on the most critical missions that required a tactical droid.\n\nIn 20 BBY, Separatist leader, Count Dooku dispatched one such droid, General Kalani, to assist King Sanjay Rash's forces in dealing with the rebels of Onderon. During this time, he worked alongside the Royal Militia's commander, General Akenathen Tandin, as they attempted to capture the rebels in Iziz, which included overseeing the brutal torture of one of the rebel leaders. However, Tandin and his forces then defected and assisted the rebels in freeing Ramsis Dendup during their escape to the highlands. When the rebels were able to defeat the droid gunships, Kalani was then ordered to retreat with his forces to Agamar, despite Rash's objections. Kalani then executed Rash.\n\nAnother super tactical droid, Aut-O was stationed aboard a Providence-class Dreadnought. However, he was destroyed by R2-D2. Another one was given command of a commandeered Venator-class Star Destroyer with the mission to destroy the Republic strategy conference on Valor station in the Carida system. However, when the buzz droids failed in stopping D-Squad, the super tactical droid and it's crew were destroyed before they were able to complete their mission.\n\nAnother super tactical droid, Kraken, served as second-in-command to Admiral Trench. Kraken then attempted to take a captured clone trooper CT-5385 to Count Dooku. However, he was stopped by General Skywalker and two of his 501st Legion troopers; Clone Captain Rex and ARC trooper Fives. The trio quickly destroyed Kraken's droid guard. After Kraken told Skywalker he was programmed to resist intimidation, the Jedi decapitated Kraken for his refusal to answer his questions. However, he was then rebuilt and commanded the Separatist forces during the invasion of Scipio alongside Dooku. Kraken continued to serve under Dooku aboard his command ship, even when his master, Lord Sidious, demanded his presence.\n\nA super tactical droid then accompanied General Grievous to Utapau aboard a Separatist supply ship to secure the shipment of a enormous kyber crystal. However, it was destroyed when the Jedi's top members intervened.\n\nAnother super tactical droid served Admiral Trench during the Battle of Anaxes. the droid was stationed on the bridge of Trench's dreadnought, where they and the Admiral oversaw the attack on Anaxes's Assembly Complex. The droid was destroyed when Anakin Skywalker stormed the bridge of the ship to get the last sequence from Admiral Trench for a bomb hidden in the plant's fusion reactor.\n\n",

        "content": "# ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid - Design[]\n\nIn response to the T-series tactical droid's inflexibility, the secessionist Confederacy of Independent Systems commissioned the battle droid manufacturer, Baktoid Combat Automata, to produce the ST-series super tactical droid for use in its military forces during the galaxy-spanning conflict known as the Clone Wars between itself and the dominant Galactic Republic. These enhanced tactical droids improved on their predecessors' shortcomings and were better at predicting how organic commanders would respond to events. They also had a status indicator for their central processing hubs. The super tactical droids had a total of three photoreceptors, which gave them sight to a large range of the light spectrum.\n\nThe ST-series stood at 1.94 meters or 6 feet, 4 inches in height. Despite being just one centimeter taller than their predecessor, they managed to seem far bigger, dominating a room with an arrogantly assured presence that the boxy T-series never managed. ST-series units were constructed with superior armor plating than that of the T-series, particularly on the limbs. The palms and inner surface of their improved hands were fitted with magnatomic grip panels, which allowed them to pick up and use most weapons, tools and equipment made for organic beings, without dropping them. The ST-series tougher armor and neck joints were not the super tactical droids' only updates over their predecessors. They also had greater heating ventilation than their predecessors. Although they retained heat sinks in their abdomen, super tactical droids had additional ventilation holes in their armor\non the sides of their chest units, just below the shoulder joints. Their extra processing power resulted in additional heat production by their complex computers.\n\nThe ST-series were better built than the T-series and their vocoders had a more threatening robotic voice than their predecessors. Super tactical droids also developed their own personalities. Some of them, such as General Kalani, gave themselves names instead of numbers. They also often chose their own personalized color schemes and decorations for their armored bodies, with Kalani choosing ornate gold trims to his armor, while Kraken went for a swirling pattern of gold on his green armor.\n\nSuper tactical droids were programmed to serve as generals and admirals in the Separatist war machine. They were ruthless and calculating leaders but were still arrogant and overconfident like earlier tactical droid models. They were also argumentative and operated without sympathy or morality, executing ruthless strategies.\n\nThe super tactical droids possessed more advanced processors than the T-series, which enabled them to be far more capable of calculating tactics and countermoves that could challenge their Republic opponents. They were also able to react far more quickly to unexpected events. Overall, they were a far more dangerous foe than the T-series, matching the military acumen of even some experienced CIS generals.\n\nDifferences aside, the super tactical droid, as with their counterpart in the Separatist Droid Army, was analytical and calculating. Created to digest a situation of battle and formulate the most effective solution with a time frame for its execution, they were dreaded by Republic soldiers and seen as very dangerous to veteran officers.\n\n",

These compact droids used tool-tipped appendages stored in recessed compartments. Many starfighters relied on astromech copilots to control flight and power distribution systems. Sitting in an astromech socket exposed to space, the droid, in addition to its piloting duties, could calculate hyperspace jumps and perform simple repairs. The astromedic was a mix between an astromech and a medical droid.\n\nMost astromechs were only able to communicate in writing, conveyed via another computer system, or through a special code of clicks, bleeps, and similar sounds, known as binary. However, certain other droids, such as the protocol droid C-3PO, could understand the binary code of astromechs, and often translated from binary to other languages.\n\nAstromech droids averaged 0.93 meters in height, while R-series droids from the R2 line forward had a height of just over a meter. However, the astromech P2 stood around the same height as a human.\n\nR-series droids had three wheeled legs. The later BB-series astromech droids were spherical, giving them the ability to roll. Some astromechs, such as OC-JK14, were moved on treadwells. Though this style was once popular in the Outer Rim Territories, it had fallen out of favor by 35 ABY.\n\n",

He was an entertainment droid, programmed to spread humor and mirth. As such, he told jokes constantly, even in the most dire of circumstances. Indeed, he claimed that dangerous circumstances were the most opportune times to tell jokes since it was during such crises that levity was most needed to lighten the mood. The droid tended to laugh at his own gags; his laugh was a high-pitched, staccato sound that terminated in a snort. Although some members of Lin-D's audience found his constant quipping annoying, the droid had little sympathy for them; for instance, when C-3PO expressed irritation at the entertainment droid's shenanigans, Lin-D said he thought the protocol droid needed to lighten up. Lin-D was fluent in Basic and was programmed with a masculine personality.\n\nLin-D had a humanoid body structure, with two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head. Although his neck and limbs were long and thin, standing him a bit taller than 1.7 meters, he had a pot belly. Lin-D's face was elongated, with a large nose and a long jaw centered between wide cheeks. The droid had a large, ever-grinning mouth that could open and close. Lin-D's neck, hands, nose, and brow were gray in color, and his fingers, mouth, jowls, forehead, and upper arms were silver. In contrast, his forearms, elbows, torso, and legs were rich orange with light-orange piping. He sported two orange circles where a Human's ears would be, and he had white photoreceptors with small black pupils in their centers. Lin-D could move the pupils in different directions either in tandem or separately, an effect he exploited to enhance the zaniness of his comic performances.\n\n",

Upon arrival, these droids would analyze the area with their powerful sensor arrays; sending the results of the scan back to the droid's creator. Droids of this type were used in many roles: military reconnaissance, deep space exploration, and mineral prospecting (primarily in asteroid fields). Other models were atmospheric-bound, relying on repulsorlift technology to move rapidly and traverse height differentials. Most scout droids carried a similar core loadout\u2014a multiple-spectrum photoreceptor, a magnetic imaging device, a thermal imager, and signals transmission equipment. Some models featured built-in weaponry, such as a blaster, or expansion slots that could be used for a variety of additional sensors or weapons. Some droids also included a self-destruct mechanism to prevent acquisition by others. Because of their clearly defined role and the need to keep the cost per unit down, probe droids were given inexpensive processing units and relatively \"dumb\" A.I. This resulted in a lack of flexibility and systemic errors when confronted with unknown circumstances not outlined in the computer's parameters.

Droids could follow orders to the letter, taking risks no organic unit ever would yet still maintaining their calm precision. Most importantly, however, these droids were expendable\u2014unlike sentients, the amount of time and energy it cost to assemble a droid was often a tiny fraction that of recruiting (or growing) an organic and training them. Built on massive automated assembly lines, like the ones on Geonosis, thousands of capable droids could be produced in a matter of hours. Because of these factors, droids were used extensively as military units, most famously by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Despite these advantages, however, combat droids suffered from several drawbacks. Most importantly, in order to create total obedience and foil any chance of rebellion, droid units were often crippled with extremely sub-par artificial intelligence. This drawback was exemplified by the hideously poor A.I. of the B1-series battle droid, which rarely served any purpose other than as cannon fodder.

These limitations notwithstanding, droids were grouped according to their primary factory-installed functionality.\n\n",

        "content": "# Droid - Astromech droids[]\n\nDroids used for interstellar starships, astromech droids, were mobile multi-role droids capable of hyperspace navigation, systems monitoring/control, damage repair, and data storage. These droids had extensive databases of stellar systems and hyperspatial coordinates, which were necessary for faster-than-light travel. Astromech droids were also used in certain starfighter models, typically those with hyperdrives. They served a similar, though expanded, role\u2014supplementing the ship's onboard computer systems and aiding the pilot in navigation, repair, and interfacing. More advanced astromech models could often pilot a small craft by themselves, blurring the line between an astromech droid and a pilot droid. Some astromechs, like members of the R2 series, were equipped with numerous features that expanded their functionality beyond navigation and repair, allowing them to become useful in almost any situation. Because of their emphasis in technical fields, astromech droids were not equipped with vocabulators or language programming; instead communicating through a series of beeps and whistles known as binary. In addition to an astromech's factory-installed functionality, many of these droids were customizable\u2014allowing upgrades to sensors, tools, software, and even basic hardware.\n\n",

Droid interrogators could be more effective than Human ones for a number of reasons: impersonal machines often increased the subject's fear, making him more likely to be cooperative; droids offered a precise medical-based analysis of a subject's system and tolerances, and whether or not he was telling the truth, all of which could be exploited frighteningly effectively by integrated serums and other tools of torture. Additionally, subjects under interrogation by droids often directed their anger and fear towards the mechanized machines, not towards the actual captors. This was often followed up by a later visit from a \"friendly\" sentient officer, offering sympathy and establishing a friend-like relationship. Once a rapport had been established, often the subject would divulge secrets willingly, without requiring direct (and sometimes ineffective) coercion.\n\n",
