        "content": "# The Force Theme - In the movies[]\n\nIn the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, \"The Force Theme\" underscores the film's resolution. It is used in a similar fashion in several early episodes of the subsequent television series. It reappears in \"Overlords,\" underscoring Obi-Wan's comments to his vision of Qui-Gon Jinn regarding Anakin. The episode also introduces an ascending variant of the theme, using the first few notes, as a motif for the family on Mortis\u2014most prominently heard during establishing shots of the temple. It is also reused and connects to \"Ahsoka's Theme\" in \"The Wrong Jedi.\"\n\nIn Episode VII The Force Awakens, the tune appears in the tracks \"Maz's Counsel\" and \"Han and Leia,\" as well as in \"The Ways of the Force,\" when Rey and Kylo Ren are fighting, and in \"The Jedi Steps and Finale\" at the end of the film, when Rey finds Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To.\n\nA version of the tune plays three times in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: when Bail Organa is seen onscreen for the first time in the Rebellion's debriefing with Jyn Erso at the beginning of the film; once when Jyn, Cassian Andor, and K-2SO depart Yavin for Jedha; and again at the end of the film as Leia's Tantive IV jumps to hyperspace fleeing Scarif with the Death Star plans. Although the Jedi and the Force are mentioned, no Jedi appear in the film, thus the slightly altered version of the piece.\n\nEpisode VIII The Last Jedi features the theme in several tracks, most notably \"The Sacred Jedi Texts,\" \"The Last Jedi,\" and \"Peace and Purpose.\" It also appears while Kylo Ren (Ben) and Rey are using physical Force bond connection for the first time touching hands in the stone hut after Rey's mirror discovery in the cave. Kylo Ren's theme and Rey's are mixed together before the Force theme comes in near the end from \"The Cave\" track. For the third time in a row, the Force theme closes the movie as a part of the finale.\n\nIn Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the theme is present in \"We Go Together\" during Leia and Rey's hug, when Rey heals the snake, in \"The Final Saber Duel\" when Rey is healing Kylo Ren, in \"Destiny of a Jedi\", in \"Coming Together\", in \"The Force Is with You\" during the final confrontation between Rey and Darth Sidious, in \"Reunion\" during the victory celebration on Ajan Kloss and in the \"Finale\".",

        "content": "# The Force Theme - In the movies[]\n\nIt was introduced in Episode IV A New Hope when Princess Leia Organa gives R2-D2 the Death Star plans, but its most prominent inclusion was in the scene where Luke Skywalker gazes out to the twin suns of Tatooine. Later in the film, the theme plays as Luke comes upon his burning homestead and when a TIE fighter chases him during the battle over the Death Star, It once again starts near the end of this battle, when Obi-Wan Kenobi starts talking to Luke. Lastly in A New Hope, the theme plays twice during the victory celebration scene.\n\nIn Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, it plays when Luke grabs his lightsaber using the Force in the wampa's cave, when the Rebels are retreating from the AT-AT walkers, when Yoda reveals himself as the Jedi Master Luke had been looking for, and then several times on Dagobah. As Luke calls to Leia as he hangs from the bottom of Cloud City, Leia hears him through the Force, a unique ability for someone who is untrained. \"The Force Theme\" can again be heard when Leia hears her brother's words.\n\nIn Episode VI Return of the Jedi, when Luke asks Leia of her memories of her real mother, \"The Force Theme\" is played. At the end of the film, \"The Force Theme\" is played when Darth Vader grabs Darth Sidious and throws him into a chasm. As Vader is burned, the theme is reprised as he passes into the Force.\n\nAt the beginning of Episode I The Phantom Menace, the theme accompanies Qui-Gon Jinn trying to cut through the Trade Federation's door. It plays again when Qui-Gon advises Anakin just before the podrace and when Shmi tells him Anakin has no father. As Anakin leaves Tatooine to become a Jedi, the theme comes in an outburst as he leaves his mother. The theme is much audible during Anakin's test before the Jedi Council on Coruscant; Yoda tells him that the fear Anakin feels could Iead him to the dark side of the Force. A triumphant variation of the theme is heard alongside Duel of the Fates when Anakin and R2-D2 escape the exploding Droid Control Ship in their N-1 starfighter after accidentally destroying the control ship's main reactor. It can also be heard when Obi-Wan uses the Force to summon his master's lightsaber and slay Darth Maul, during the climactic lightsaber duel in the Theed Royal Palace. The theme is hinted at in the funeral music of Qui-Gon Jinn, which is brought back in Episode III.\n\nIn Episode II Attack of the Clones, the theme plays as Anakin and Padm\u00e9 Amidala depart incognito to Naboo. As Anakin stands looking out to the sunset of Tatooine, the theme returns as he decides to venture out to look for his mother, who he just learned had been kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. The theme is reprised during the First Battle of Geonosis as Anakin pleads with Obi-Wan to halt their pursuit of Count Dooku to recover Padm\u00e9, and Yoda senses the impending confrontation.\n\nEpisode III Revenge of the Sith opens with \"The Force Theme\" accompanying the Battle of Coruscant backdrop as the camera follows Anakin and Obi-Wan in their starfighters, and playing again as they land on the Invisible Hand. It plays when Anakin tells Padm\u00e9 about her death in his dreams. Due to his nightmares, Anakin tells Yoda of his preoccupations: the theme is played with deep tones as Yoda tells him that \"death is a natural part of life.\" The theme is reprised during Obi-Wan's and Anakin's conversation before the Jedi Master departs to Utapau, and again as he arrives. It is played again when Anakin gets into an airspeeder and goes to Mace Windu and Darth Sidious' duel and then when Anakin asks Windu not to kill Sidious. The theme can be heard when Anakin and Obi-Wan both use the Force against each other. The piece \"Battle of the Heroes\" quotes the theme as Obi-Wan tries desperately to bring Anakin back to the light. It is played again as Darth Vader wakes up for the first time in his new suit and when Yoda reveals to Obi-Wan that his former master, Qui-Gon Jinn, became immortal. The song can be heard again when Darth Vader and Darth Sidious watch the construction of the Death Star. The movie closes with this theme in a reprise of \"Binary Sunset,\" just as it opened with it.",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (soundtrack) - Differences between the album, film, and initial score[]\n\nThe score presented in the film is different in many respects from what John Williams had intended, because of George Lucas' editing choices.\n\nDue to the process Lucas puts his films through during editing, many scenes were streamlined and music was removed. Also true to form for the prequel trilogy, many scenes contained pre-planned tracked music. Such is the case of \"The Tide Turns\" from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, tracked in for the scene when Anakin flies the now-crippled Invisible Hand for a crash landing on Coruscant.\n\nAnother source of differences between the music in the film and on the soundtrack is that in the recording process, John Williams recorded cues multiple times and used those takes to make one edit of the track.\n\nThe music in the opening of the film\u2014after the scroll\u2014starts with only low taiko drums, which continue until the music is finally tracked in, and continue layered underneath the music. The album recording, however, does not have such prominent percussion and, in some cases, has slightly different orchestrations in the parts that can be compared to the film. The differences stem from changes made during the recording process and from alternate takes of the same cue. The actual landing of the ship in the film also contains a partial ending not heard on the album.\n\nThe album also contains alternate versions of some of the battle cues, as well as most of the unused segment \"The Elevator Scene,\" which was supposed to play when Anakin and Obi-Wan struggle in the elevator shaft on their way to rescue Palpatine. \"I Am the Senate,\" a piece drastically altered in the film, originally featured music to score the scene where Palpatine is attempting to persuade Anakin to join him while shocking Mace Windu. This music was cut from the film, but it can be heard in the video games. Another cue, \"Padm\u00e9's Ruminations,\" is different from what is heard on the album, both in its mix and in the vocal performance.\n\nMuch of the film contains percussion alternates. For example, \"Moving Things Along\" (\"Enter Lord Vader\" on the album) has a percussion track in the film not present on the album. This stems from the fact that the percussion of many cues was recorded separately, to be laid onto the cue in mixing.\n\n\"Battle of the Heroes\" begins with strings on the album but not in the movie, and in the movie the ending is different, although this stems from the fact that the version on the album is a concert-suite representation of the cue.\n\nWilliams' album \"End Credits Medley\" is much longer than the piece heard in the film. The end credits for the film mainly include the original Star Wars theme and a selection of the new cues, such as \"Battle of the Heroes\" as well as a reprisal of \"Princess Leia's Theme.\" The album medley, however, includes as well as these themes a reprise of \"The Throne Room\" suite from A New Hope.\n\n\"Duel of the Fates\" also makes an appearance in the score. This time, however, the choir was rerecorded and layered over the choirless recording from The Phantom Menace.\n\nMost of the score can be heard in the album and various LucasArts video games, but a complete release has yet to be made.\n\n",

        "content": "# The Force Theme - In the movies[]\n\nIt was introduced in Episode IV A New Hope when Princess Leia Organa gives R2-D2 the Death Star plans, but its most prominent inclusion was in the scene where Luke Skywalker gazes out to the twin suns of Tatooine. Later in the film, the theme plays as Luke comes upon his burning homestead and when a TIE fighter chases him during the battle over the Death Star, It once again starts near the end of this battle, when Obi-Wan Kenobi starts talking to Luke. Lastly in A New Hope, the theme plays twice during the victory celebration scene.\n\nIn Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, it plays when Luke grabs his lightsaber using the Force in the wampa's cave, when the Rebels are retreating from the AT-AT walkers, when Yoda reveals himself as the Jedi Master Luke had been looking for, and then several times on Dagobah. As Luke calls to Leia as he hangs from the bottom of Cloud City, Leia hears him through the Force, a unique ability for someone who is untrained. \"The Force Theme\" can again be heard when Leia hears her brother's words.\n\nIn Episode VI Return of the Jedi, when Luke asks Leia of her memories of her real mother, \"The Force Theme\" is played. At the end of the film, \"The Force Theme\" is played when Darth Vader grabs Darth Sidious and throws him into a chasm. As Vader is burned, the theme is reprised as he passes into the Force.\n\nAt the beginning of Episode I The Phantom Menace, the theme accompanies Qui-Gon Jinn trying to cut through the Trade Federation's door. It plays again when Qui-Gon advises Anakin just before the podrace and when Shmi tells him Anakin has no father. As Anakin leaves Tatooine to become a Jedi, the theme comes in an outburst as he leaves his mother. The theme is much audible during Anakin's test before the Jedi Council on Coruscant; Yoda tells him that the fear Anakin feels could Iead him to the dark side of the Force. A triumphant variation of the theme is heard alongside Duel of the Fates when Anakin and R2-D2 escape the exploding Droid Control Ship in their N-1 starfighter after accidentally destroying the control ship's main reactor. It can also be heard when Obi-Wan uses the Force to summon his master's lightsaber and slay Darth Maul, during the climactic lightsaber duel in the Theed Royal Palace. The theme is hinted at in the funeral music of Qui-Gon Jinn, which is brought back in Episode III.\n\nIn Episode II Attack of the Clones, the theme plays as Anakin and Padm\u00e9 Amidala depart incognito to Naboo. As Anakin stands looking out to the sunset of Tatooine, the theme returns as he decides to venture out to look for his mother, who he just learned had been kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. The theme is reprised during the First Battle of Geonosis as Anakin pleads with Obi-Wan to halt their pursuit of Count Dooku to recover Padm\u00e9, and Yoda senses the impending confrontation.\n\nEpisode III Revenge of the Sith opens with \"The Force Theme\" accompanying the Battle of Coruscant backdrop as the camera follows Anakin and Obi-Wan in their starfighters, and playing again as they land on the Invisible Hand. It plays when Anakin tells Padm\u00e9 about her death in his dreams. Due to his nightmares, Anakin tells Yoda of his preoccupations: the theme is played with deep tones as Yoda tells him that \"death is a natural part of life.\" The theme is reprised during Obi-Wan's and Anakin's conversation before the Jedi Master departs to Utapau, and again as he arrives. It is played again when Anakin gets into an airspeeder and goes to Mace Windu and Darth Sidious' duel and then when Anakin asks Windu not to kill Sidious. The theme can be heard when Anakin and Obi-Wan both use the Force against each other. The piece \"Battle of the Heroes\" quotes the theme as Obi-Wan tries desperately to bring Anakin back to the light. It is played again as Darth Vader wakes up for the first time in his new suit and when Yoda reveals to Obi-Wan that his former master, Qui-Gon Jinn, became immortal. The song can be heard again when Darth Vader and Darth Sidious watch the construction of the Death Star. The movie closes with this theme in a reprise of \"Binary Sunset,\" just as it opened with it.\n\nIn the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, \"The Force Theme\" underscores the film's resolution. It is used in a similar fashion in several early episodes of the subsequent television series. It reappears in \"Overlords,\" underscoring Obi-Wan's comments to his vision of Qui-Gon Jinn regarding Anakin. The episode also introduces an ascending variant of the theme, using the first few notes, as a motif for the family on Mortis\u2014most prominently heard during establishing shots of the temple. It is also reused and connects to \"Ahsoka's Theme\" in \"The Wrong Jedi.\"\n\nIn Episode VII The Force Awakens, the tune appears in the tracks \"Maz's Counsel\" and \"Han and Leia,\" as well as in \"The Ways of the Force,\" when Rey and Kylo Ren are fighting, and in \"The Jedi Steps and Finale\" at the end of the film, when Rey finds Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To.\n\nA version of the tune plays three times in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: when Bail Organa is seen onscreen for the first time in the Rebellion's debriefing with Jyn Erso at the beginning of the film; once when Jyn, Cassian Andor, and K-2SO depart Yavin for Jedha; and again at the end of the film as Leia's Tantive IV jumps to hyperspace fleeing Scarif with the Death Star plans. Although the Jedi and the Force are mentioned, no Jedi appear in the film, thus the slightly altered version of the piece.\n\nEpisode VIII The Last Jedi features the theme in several tracks, most notably \"The Sacred Jedi Texts,\" \"The Last Jedi,\" and \"Peace and Purpose.\" It also appears while Kylo Ren (Ben) and Rey are using physical Force bond connection for the first time touching hands in the stone hut after Rey's mirror discovery in the cave. Kylo Ren's theme and Rey's are mixed together before the Force theme comes in near the end from \"The Cave\" track. For the third time in a row, the Force theme closes the movie as a part of the finale.\n\nIn Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the theme is present in \"We Go Together\" during Leia and Rey's hug, when Rey heals the snake, in \"The Final Saber Duel\" when Rey is healing Kylo Ren, in \"Destiny of a Jedi\", in \"Coming Together\", in \"The Force Is with You\" during the final confrontation between Rey and Darth Sidious, in \"Reunion\" during the victory celebration on Ajan Kloss and in the \"Finale\".\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (soundtrack) - Differences between the album, film, and initial score[]\n\nThe score presented in the film is different in many respects from what John Williams had intended, because of George Lucas' editing choices.\n\nDue to the process Lucas puts his films through during editing, many scenes were streamlined and music was removed. Also true to form for the prequel trilogy, many scenes contained pre-planned tracked music. Such is the case of \"The Tide Turns\" from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, tracked in for the scene when Anakin flies the now-crippled Invisible Hand for a crash landing on Coruscant.\n\nAnother source of differences between the music in the film and on the soundtrack is that in the recording process, John Williams recorded cues multiple times and used those takes to make one edit of the track.\n\nThe music in the opening of the film\u2014after the scroll\u2014starts with only low taiko drums, which continue until the music is finally tracked in, and continue layered underneath the music. The album recording, however, does not have such prominent percussion and, in some cases, has slightly different orchestrations in the parts that can be compared to the film. The differences stem from changes made during the recording process and from alternate takes of the same cue. The actual landing of the ship in the film also contains a partial ending not heard on the album.\n\nThe album also contains alternate versions of some of the battle cues, as well as most of the unused segment \"The Elevator Scene,\" which was supposed to play when Anakin and Obi-Wan struggle in the elevator shaft on their way to rescue Palpatine. \"I Am the Senate,\" a piece drastically altered in the film, originally featured music to score the scene where Palpatine is attempting to persuade Anakin to join him while shocking Mace Windu. This music was cut from the film, but it can be heard in the video games. Another cue, \"Padm\u00e9's Ruminations,\" is different from what is heard on the album, both in its mix and in the vocal performance.\n\nMuch of the film contains percussion alternates. For example, \"Moving Things Along\" (\"Enter Lord Vader\" on the album) has a percussion track in the film not present on the album. This stems from the fact that the percussion of many cues was recorded separately, to be laid onto the cue in mixing.\n\n\"Battle of the Heroes\" begins with strings on the album but not in the movie, and in the movie the ending is different, although this stems from the fact that the version on the album is a concert-suite representation of the cue.\n\nWilliams' album \"End Credits Medley\" is much longer than the piece heard in the film. The end credits for the film mainly include the original Star Wars theme and a selection of the new cues, such as \"Battle of the Heroes\" as well as a reprisal of \"Princess Leia's Theme.\" The album medley, however, includes as well as these themes a reprise of \"The Throne Room\" suite from A New Hope.\n\n\"Duel of the Fates\" also makes an appearance in the score. This time, however, the choir was rerecorded and layered over the choirless recording from The Phantom Menace.\n\nMost of the score can be heard in the album and various LucasArts video games, but a complete release has yet to be made.\n\n",

        "content": "# The Force Theme - In the movies[]\n\nIt was introduced in Episode IV A New Hope when Princess Leia Organa gives R2-D2 the Death Star plans, but its most prominent inclusion was in the scene where Luke Skywalker gazes out to the twin suns of Tatooine. Later in the film, the theme plays as Luke comes upon his burning homestead and when a TIE fighter chases him during the battle over the Death Star, It once again starts near the end of this battle, when Obi-Wan Kenobi starts talking to Luke. Lastly in A New Hope, the theme plays twice during the victory celebration scene.\n\nIn Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, it plays when Luke grabs his lightsaber using the Force in the wampa's cave, when the Rebels are retreating from the AT-AT walkers, when Yoda reveals himself as the Jedi Master Luke had been looking for, and then several times on Dagobah. As Luke calls to Leia as he hangs from the bottom of Cloud City, Leia hears him through the Force, a unique ability for someone who is untrained. \"The Force Theme\" can again be heard when Leia hears her brother's words.\n\nIn Episode VI Return of the Jedi, when Luke asks Leia of her memories of her real mother, \"The Force Theme\" is played. At the end of the film, \"The Force Theme\" is played when Darth Vader grabs Darth Sidious and throws him into a chasm. As Vader is burned, the theme is reprised as he passes into the Force.\n\nAt the beginning of Episode I The Phantom Menace, the theme accompanies Qui-Gon Jinn trying to cut through the Trade Federation's door. It plays again when Qui-Gon advises Anakin just before the podrace and when Shmi tells him Anakin has no father. As Anakin leaves Tatooine to become a Jedi, the theme comes in an outburst as he leaves his mother. The theme is much audible during Anakin's test before the Jedi Council on Coruscant; Yoda tells him that the fear Anakin feels could Iead him to the dark side of the Force. A triumphant variation of the theme is heard alongside Duel of the Fates when Anakin and R2-D2 escape the exploding Droid Control Ship in their N-1 starfighter after accidentally destroying the control ship's main reactor. It can also be heard when Obi-Wan uses the Force to summon his master's lightsaber and slay Darth Maul, during the climactic lightsaber duel in the Theed Royal Palace. The theme is hinted at in the funeral music of Qui-Gon Jinn, which is brought back in Episode III.\n\nIn Episode II Attack of the Clones, the theme plays as Anakin and Padm\u00e9 Amidala depart incognito to Naboo. As Anakin stands looking out to the sunset of Tatooine, the theme returns as he decides to venture out to look for his mother, who he just learned had been kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. The theme is reprised during the First Battle of Geonosis as Anakin pleads with Obi-Wan to halt their pursuit of Count Dooku to recover Padm\u00e9, and Yoda senses the impending confrontation.\n\nEpisode III Revenge of the Sith opens with \"The Force Theme\" accompanying the Battle of Coruscant backdrop as the camera follows Anakin and Obi-Wan in their starfighters, and playing again as they land on the Invisible Hand. It plays when Anakin tells Padm\u00e9 about her death in his dreams. Due to his nightmares, Anakin tells Yoda of his preoccupations: the theme is played with deep tones as Yoda tells him that \"death is a natural part of life.\" The theme is reprised during Obi-Wan's and Anakin's conversation before the Jedi Master departs to Utapau, and again as he arrives. It is played again when Anakin gets into an airspeeder and goes to Mace Windu and Darth Sidious' duel and then when Anakin asks Windu not to kill Sidious. The theme can be heard when Anakin and Obi-Wan both use the Force against each other. The piece \"Battle of the Heroes\" quotes the theme as Obi-Wan tries desperately to bring Anakin back to the light. It is played again as Darth Vader wakes up for the first time in his new suit and when Yoda reveals to Obi-Wan that his former master, Qui-Gon Jinn, became immortal. The song can be heard again when Darth Vader and Darth Sidious watch the construction of the Death Star. The movie closes with this theme in a reprise of \"Binary Sunset,\" just as it opened with it.",

        "content": "# The Force Theme - In the movies[]\n\nIn the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, \"The Force Theme\" underscores the film's resolution. It is used in a similar fashion in several early episodes of the subsequent television series. It reappears in \"Overlords,\" underscoring Obi-Wan's comments to his vision of Qui-Gon Jinn regarding Anakin. The episode also introduces an ascending variant of the theme, using the first few notes, as a motif for the family on Mortis\u2014most prominently heard during establishing shots of the temple. It is also reused and connects to \"Ahsoka's Theme\" in \"The Wrong Jedi.\"\n\nIn Episode VII The Force Awakens, the tune appears in the tracks \"Maz's Counsel\" and \"Han and Leia,\" as well as in \"The Ways of the Force,\" when Rey and Kylo Ren are fighting, and in \"The Jedi Steps and Finale\" at the end of the film, when Rey finds Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To.\n\nA version of the tune plays three times in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: when Bail Organa is seen onscreen for the first time in the Rebellion's debriefing with Jyn Erso at the beginning of the film; once when Jyn, Cassian Andor, and K-2SO depart Yavin for Jedha; and again at the end of the film as Leia's Tantive IV jumps to hyperspace fleeing Scarif with the Death Star plans. Although the Jedi and the Force are mentioned, no Jedi appear in the film, thus the slightly altered version of the piece.\n\nEpisode VIII The Last Jedi features the theme in several tracks, most notably \"The Sacred Jedi Texts,\" \"The Last Jedi,\" and \"Peace and Purpose.\" It also appears while Kylo Ren (Ben) and Rey are using physical Force bond connection for the first time touching hands in the stone hut after Rey's mirror discovery in the cave. Kylo Ren's theme and Rey's are mixed together before the Force theme comes in near the end from \"The Cave\" track. For the third time in a row, the Force theme closes the movie as a part of the finale.\n\nIn Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the theme is present in \"We Go Together\" during Leia and Rey's hug, when Rey heals the snake, in \"The Final Saber Duel\" when Rey is healing Kylo Ren, in \"Destiny of a Jedi\", in \"Coming Together\", in \"The Force Is with You\" during the final confrontation between Rey and Darth Sidious, in \"Reunion\" during the victory celebration on Ajan Kloss and in the \"Finale\".",

        "content": "# The Force Theme - In the movies[]\n\nIn the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, \"The Force Theme\" underscores the film's resolution. It is used in a similar fashion in several early episodes of the subsequent television series. It reappears in \"Overlords,\" underscoring Obi-Wan's comments to his vision of Qui-Gon Jinn regarding Anakin. The episode also introduces an ascending variant of the theme, using the first few notes, as a motif for the family on Mortis\u2014most prominently heard during establishing shots of the temple. It is also reused and connects to \"Ahsoka's Theme\" in \"The Wrong Jedi.\"\n\nIn Episode VII The Force Awakens, the tune appears in the tracks \"Maz's Counsel\" and \"Han and Leia,\" as well as in \"The Ways of the Force,\" when Rey and Kylo Ren are fighting, and in \"The Jedi Steps and Finale\" at the end of the film, when Rey finds Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To.\n\nA version of the tune plays three times in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: when Bail Organa is seen onscreen for the first time in the Rebellion's debriefing with Jyn Erso at the beginning of the film; once when Jyn, Cassian Andor, and K-2SO depart Yavin for Jedha; and again at the end of the film as Leia's Tantive IV jumps to hyperspace fleeing Scarif with the Death Star plans. Although the Jedi and the Force are mentioned, no Jedi appear in the film, thus the slightly altered version of the piece.\n\nEpisode VIII The Last Jedi features the theme in several tracks, most notably \"The Sacred Jedi Texts,\" \"The Last Jedi,\" and \"Peace and Purpose.\" It also appears while Kylo Ren (Ben) and Rey are using physical Force bond connection for the first time touching hands in the stone hut after Rey's mirror discovery in the cave. Kylo Ren's theme and Rey's are mixed together before the Force theme comes in near the end from \"The Cave\" track. For the third time in a row, the Force theme closes the movie as a part of the finale.\n\nIn Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the theme is present in \"We Go Together\" during Leia and Rey's hug, when Rey heals the snake, in \"The Final Saber Duel\" when Rey is healing Kylo Ren, in \"Destiny of a Jedi\", in \"Coming Together\", in \"The Force Is with You\" during the final confrontation between Rey and Darth Sidious, in \"Reunion\" during the victory celebration on Ajan Kloss and in the \"Finale\".",

        "content": "# The Force Theme - In the movies[]\n\nIt was introduced in Episode IV A New Hope when Princess Leia Organa gives R2-D2 the Death Star plans, but its most prominent inclusion was in the scene where Luke Skywalker gazes out to the twin suns of Tatooine. Later in the film, the theme plays as Luke comes upon his burning homestead and when a TIE fighter chases him during the battle over the Death Star, It once again starts near the end of this battle, when Obi-Wan Kenobi starts talking to Luke. Lastly in A New Hope, the theme plays twice during the victory celebration scene.\n\nIn Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, it plays when Luke grabs his lightsaber using the Force in the wampa's cave, when the Rebels are retreating from the AT-AT walkers, when Yoda reveals himself as the Jedi Master Luke had been looking for, and then several times on Dagobah. As Luke calls to Leia as he hangs from the bottom of Cloud City, Leia hears him through the Force, a unique ability for someone who is untrained. \"The Force Theme\" can again be heard when Leia hears her brother's words.\n\nIn Episode VI Return of the Jedi, when Luke asks Leia of her memories of her real mother, \"The Force Theme\" is played. At the end of the film, \"The Force Theme\" is played when Darth Vader grabs Darth Sidious and throws him into a chasm. As Vader is burned, the theme is reprised as he passes into the Force.\n\nAt the beginning of Episode I The Phantom Menace, the theme accompanies Qui-Gon Jinn trying to cut through the Trade Federation's door. It plays again when Qui-Gon advises Anakin just before the podrace and when Shmi tells him Anakin has no father. As Anakin leaves Tatooine to become a Jedi, the theme comes in an outburst as he leaves his mother. The theme is much audible during Anakin's test before the Jedi Council on Coruscant; Yoda tells him that the fear Anakin feels could Iead him to the dark side of the Force. A triumphant variation of the theme is heard alongside Duel of the Fates when Anakin and R2-D2 escape the exploding Droid Control Ship in their N-1 starfighter after accidentally destroying the control ship's main reactor. It can also be heard when Obi-Wan uses the Force to summon his master's lightsaber and slay Darth Maul, during the climactic lightsaber duel in the Theed Royal Palace. The theme is hinted at in the funeral music of Qui-Gon Jinn, which is brought back in Episode III.\n\nIn Episode II Attack of the Clones, the theme plays as Anakin and Padm\u00e9 Amidala depart incognito to Naboo. As Anakin stands looking out to the sunset of Tatooine, the theme returns as he decides to venture out to look for his mother, who he just learned had been kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. The theme is reprised during the First Battle of Geonosis as Anakin pleads with Obi-Wan to halt their pursuit of Count Dooku to recover Padm\u00e9, and Yoda senses the impending confrontation.\n\nEpisode III Revenge of the Sith opens with \"The Force Theme\" accompanying the Battle of Coruscant backdrop as the camera follows Anakin and Obi-Wan in their starfighters, and playing again as they land on the Invisible Hand. It plays when Anakin tells Padm\u00e9 about her death in his dreams. Due to his nightmares, Anakin tells Yoda of his preoccupations: the theme is played with deep tones as Yoda tells him that \"death is a natural part of life.\" The theme is reprised during Obi-Wan's and Anakin's conversation before the Jedi Master departs to Utapau, and again as he arrives. It is played again when Anakin gets into an airspeeder and goes to Mace Windu and Darth Sidious' duel and then when Anakin asks Windu not to kill Sidious. The theme can be heard when Anakin and Obi-Wan both use the Force against each other. The piece \"Battle of the Heroes\" quotes the theme as Obi-Wan tries desperately to bring Anakin back to the light. It is played again as Darth Vader wakes up for the first time in his new suit and when Yoda reveals to Obi-Wan that his former master, Qui-Gon Jinn, became immortal. The song can be heard again when Darth Vader and Darth Sidious watch the construction of the Death Star. The movie closes with this theme in a reprise of \"Binary Sunset,\" just as it opened with it.",

        "content": "# The Force Theme - In the movies[]\n\nIt was introduced in Episode IV A New Hope when Princess Leia Organa gives R2-D2 the Death Star plans, but its most prominent inclusion was in the scene where Luke Skywalker gazes out to the twin suns of Tatooine. Later in the film, the theme plays as Luke comes upon his burning homestead and when a TIE fighter chases him during the battle over the Death Star, It once again starts near the end of this battle, when Obi-Wan Kenobi starts talking to Luke. Lastly in A New Hope, the theme plays twice during the victory celebration scene.\n\nIn Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, it plays when Luke grabs his lightsaber using the Force in the wampa's cave, when the Rebels are retreating from the AT-AT walkers, when Yoda reveals himself as the Jedi Master Luke had been looking for, and then several times on Dagobah. As Luke calls to Leia as he hangs from the bottom of Cloud City, Leia hears him through the Force, a unique ability for someone who is untrained. \"The Force Theme\" can again be heard when Leia hears her brother's words.\n\nIn Episode VI Return of the Jedi, when Luke asks Leia of her memories of her real mother, \"The Force Theme\" is played. At the end of the film, \"The Force Theme\" is played when Darth Vader grabs Darth Sidious and throws him into a chasm. As Vader is burned, the theme is reprised as he passes into the Force.\n\nAt the beginning of Episode I The Phantom Menace, the theme accompanies Qui-Gon Jinn trying to cut through the Trade Federation's door. It plays again when Qui-Gon advises Anakin just before the podrace and when Shmi tells him Anakin has no father. As Anakin leaves Tatooine to become a Jedi, the theme comes in an outburst as he leaves his mother. The theme is much audible during Anakin's test before the Jedi Council on Coruscant; Yoda tells him that the fear Anakin feels could Iead him to the dark side of the Force. A triumphant variation of the theme is heard alongside Duel of the Fates when Anakin and R2-D2 escape the exploding Droid Control Ship in their N-1 starfighter after accidentally destroying the control ship's main reactor. It can also be heard when Obi-Wan uses the Force to summon his master's lightsaber and slay Darth Maul, during the climactic lightsaber duel in the Theed Royal Palace. The theme is hinted at in the funeral music of Qui-Gon Jinn, which is brought back in Episode III.\n\nIn Episode II Attack of the Clones, the theme plays as Anakin and Padm\u00e9 Amidala depart incognito to Naboo. As Anakin stands looking out to the sunset of Tatooine, the theme returns as he decides to venture out to look for his mother, who he just learned had been kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. The theme is reprised during the First Battle of Geonosis as Anakin pleads with Obi-Wan to halt their pursuit of Count Dooku to recover Padm\u00e9, and Yoda senses the impending confrontation.\n\nEpisode III Revenge of the Sith opens with \"The Force Theme\" accompanying the Battle of Coruscant backdrop as the camera follows Anakin and Obi-Wan in their starfighters, and playing again as they land on the Invisible Hand. It plays when Anakin tells Padm\u00e9 about her death in his dreams. Due to his nightmares, Anakin tells Yoda of his preoccupations: the theme is played with deep tones as Yoda tells him that \"death is a natural part of life.\" The theme is reprised during Obi-Wan's and Anakin's conversation before the Jedi Master departs to Utapau, and again as he arrives. It is played again when Anakin gets into an airspeeder and goes to Mace Windu and Darth Sidious' duel and then when Anakin asks Windu not to kill Sidious. The theme can be heard when Anakin and Obi-Wan both use the Force against each other. The piece \"Battle of the Heroes\" quotes the theme as Obi-Wan tries desperately to bring Anakin back to the light. It is played again as Darth Vader wakes up for the first time in his new suit and when Yoda reveals to Obi-Wan that his former master, Qui-Gon Jinn, became immortal. The song can be heard again when Darth Vader and Darth Sidious watch the construction of the Death Star. The movie closes with this theme in a reprise of \"Binary Sunset,\" just as it opened with it.\n\nIn the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, \"The Force Theme\" underscores the film's resolution. It is used in a similar fashion in several early episodes of the subsequent television series. It reappears in \"Overlords,\" underscoring Obi-Wan's comments to his vision of Qui-Gon Jinn regarding Anakin. The episode also introduces an ascending variant of the theme, using the first few notes, as a motif for the family on Mortis\u2014most prominently heard during establishing shots of the temple. It is also reused and connects to \"Ahsoka's Theme\" in \"The Wrong Jedi.\"\n\nIn Episode VII The Force Awakens, the tune appears in the tracks \"Maz's Counsel\" and \"Han and Leia,\" as well as in \"The Ways of the Force,\" when Rey and Kylo Ren are fighting, and in \"The Jedi Steps and Finale\" at the end of the film, when Rey finds Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To.\n\nA version of the tune plays three times in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: when Bail Organa is seen onscreen for the first time in the Rebellion's debriefing with Jyn Erso at the beginning of the film; once when Jyn, Cassian Andor, and K-2SO depart Yavin for Jedha; and again at the end of the film as Leia's Tantive IV jumps to hyperspace fleeing Scarif with the Death Star plans. Although the Jedi and the Force are mentioned, no Jedi appear in the film, thus the slightly altered version of the piece.\n\nEpisode VIII The Last Jedi features the theme in several tracks, most notably \"The Sacred Jedi Texts,\" \"The Last Jedi,\" and \"Peace and Purpose.\" It also appears while Kylo Ren (Ben) and Rey are using physical Force bond connection for the first time touching hands in the stone hut after Rey's mirror discovery in the cave. Kylo Ren's theme and Rey's are mixed together before the Force theme comes in near the end from \"The Cave\" track. For the third time in a row, the Force theme closes the movie as a part of the finale.\n\nIn Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the theme is present in \"We Go Together\" during Leia and Rey's hug, when Rey heals the snake, in \"The Final Saber Duel\" when Rey is healing Kylo Ren, in \"Destiny of a Jedi\", in \"Coming Together\", in \"The Force Is with You\" during the final confrontation between Rey and Darth Sidious, in \"Reunion\" during the victory celebration on Ajan Kloss and in the \"Finale\".\n\n",

Specifically, it appears in \"Open the Door\" when Luke lowers his hood to reveal his face to Din Djarin, Grogu, Carasynthia Dune and Bo-Katan Kryze.\n\nIn The Book of Boba Fett, the theme is present in Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger, during the scene of Luke and Grogu training on Ossus.\n\nIn Ahsoka, elements of the theme is played in Part Eight: The Jedi, the Witch, and the Warlord when Sabine Wren uses the force for the first time.\n\nIn Tales of the Jedi, the theme is present in \"Dooku vs Yaddle\" in The Sith Lord, during Dooku and Yaddle's duel, when Yaddle uses the Force to lift up the hangar gate.\n\nIn Young Jedi Adventures, the theme is present in The Caves of Batuu when Kai Brightstar's vision ends and he embraces the Force and that greatness is not rooted in perfection but from the knowledge that there is always more to learn.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (soundtrack) - Differences between the album, film, and initial score[]\n\nThe score presented in the film is different in many respects from what John Williams had intended, because of George Lucas' editing choices.\n\nDue to the process Lucas puts his films through during editing, many scenes were streamlined and music was removed. Also true to form for the prequel trilogy, many scenes contained pre-planned tracked music. Such is the case of \"The Tide Turns\" from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, tracked in for the scene when Anakin flies the now-crippled Invisible Hand for a crash landing on Coruscant.\n\nAnother source of differences between the music in the film and on the soundtrack is that in the recording process, John Williams recorded cues multiple times and used those takes to make one edit of the track.\n\nThe music in the opening of the film\u2014after the scroll\u2014starts with only low taiko drums, which continue until the music is finally tracked in, and continue layered underneath the music. The album recording, however, does not have such prominent percussion and, in some cases, has slightly different orchestrations in the parts that can be compared to the film. The differences stem from changes made during the recording process and from alternate takes of the same cue. The actual landing of the ship in the film also contains a partial ending not heard on the album.\n\nThe album also contains alternate versions of some of the battle cues, as well as most of the unused segment \"The Elevator Scene,\" which was supposed to play when Anakin and Obi-Wan struggle in the elevator shaft on their way to rescue Palpatine. \"I Am the Senate,\" a piece drastically altered in the film, originally featured music to score the scene where Palpatine is attempting to persuade Anakin to join him while shocking Mace Windu. This music was cut from the film, but it can be heard in the video games. Another cue, \"Padm\u00e9's Ruminations,\" is different from what is heard on the album, both in its mix and in the vocal performance.\n\nMuch of the film contains percussion alternates. For example, \"Moving Things Along\" (\"Enter Lord Vader\" on the album) has a percussion track in the film not present on the album. This stems from the fact that the percussion of many cues was recorded separately, to be laid onto the cue in mixing.\n\n\"Battle of the Heroes\" begins with strings on the album but not in the movie, and in the movie the ending is different, although this stems from the fact that the version on the album is a concert-suite representation of the cue.\n\nWilliams' album \"End Credits Medley\" is much longer than the piece heard in the film. The end credits for the film mainly include the original Star Wars theme and a selection of the new cues, such as \"Battle of the Heroes\" as well as a reprisal of \"Princess Leia's Theme.\" The album medley, however, includes as well as these themes a reprise of \"The Throne Room\" suite from A New Hope.\n\n\"Duel of the Fates\" also makes an appearance in the score. This time, however, the choir was rerecorded and layered over the choirless recording from The Phantom Menace.\n\nMost of the score can be heard in the album and various LucasArts video games, but a complete release has yet to be made.\n\n",

While the theme played, an announcer said:\n\"Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones...on the GCN Radio Network.

It was written to represent the duel in Theed between the Sith Darth Maul and the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn with his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi in the \"Duel of the Fates\" scene at the end of the movie. The composition was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and the London Voices choir in February 1999 in EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, England. The piece was used in all three of the prequel trilogy movies and included on the soundtracks of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, likewise also briefly appearing in the Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story and its accompanying soundtrack's deluxe edition. The motif is used many times throughout video games, trailers, and numerous other pieces of Star Wars Legends media, as well as in the music video trailer for The Phantom Menace, which includes footage of the theme's recording sessions.\n\nThe theme is mainly polyphonic, is in the keys of E and G minor, and has a minor mode, a tempo of 152 bpm, and a duple meter with a time signature of 4/4. The composition, which lasts four minutes and fourteen seconds, contains lyrical Sanskrit chants translated from the Celtic epic Cad Goddeu. The composition was made available for purchase on May 4, 1999, with the release of the soundtrack for The Phantom Menace, and the sheet music was released in the music books Music from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones: Selections from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Star Wars: A Musical Journey: Episodes I-VI, Selections from Star Wars, Star Wars Episodes I, II & III Instrumental Solos, and Star Wars for Beginning Piano Solo.\n\n",

        "content": "# Duel of the Fates - Conception and development[]\n\nJohn Williams wrote the score for the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and the respective soundtrack, as he had for the previous three Star Wars films of the original trilogy. He began work on the project in mid-October of 1998. \"Duel of the Fates\" was written as the main theatrical motif for the film and was utilized in various forms throughout the scenes depicting the climax of the film during the Battle of Naboo where the Trade Federation forces battle the Royal Naboo Security Forces. The piece is used mainly to represent the duel between Darth Maul, a dark Lord of the Sith, and the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nWhen composing the theme, Williams felt something ritualistic and pagan would be very effective in evoking the proper emotions, so he took a stanza of text from the Celtic epic Cad Goddeu. He had friends from Harvard University translate the English version back to Celtic, then to Greek, and finally Sanskrit, which he chose for its \"beautiful sounds.\" Williams then reduced the stanza to phrases consisting of a single word when translated to English and repeated their Sanskrit counterparts. Williams composed the music for the motif on a piano. The piece, along with the entire score, was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices in EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, England in February 1999, both recording live at the same time. The motif was written for The Phantom Menace's end credits and then cut to fit in the picture.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars Main Title - In popular culture[]\n\nThe \"Main Title\" has become one of the most recognized theatrical themes ever written.\n\nOn the January 21, 1978 episode of Saturday Night Live, Bill Murray's lounge singer character sang a version of the Star Wars theme with lyrics. In the same month, the Star Wars theme featured at the Hong Kong Ready-to-Wear Festival during a marching showcase of children's clothing on the catwalk.\n\nThe piece was also performed after the 20th Century Fox Fanfare in set one of the international tour of Star Wars: In Concert. The concerts were conducted by Dirk Brosse. The theme appears in the end credits of the special Robot Chicken: Star Wars, where it is sung by chickens. Disco artist Meco released a disco version of the theme in 1977 on the album Star Wars and other Galactic Funk. It reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on October 1. It held that position for two weeks. The single became the biggest-selling instrumental single in the history of recorded music, being the first to be certified platinum (2 million units) by the RIAA. Meco's version eventually was used officially in the Star Wars franchise with Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, where it played in the arcade mode of the game upon approaching the arcade cabinets. Similarly, it also played when pressing certain buttons on Kamino in the game LEGO: Star Wars.\n\nIt has also been heard in The Lego Movie when Emmett and the Master Builders are arguing how to access Lord Business' tower.\n\n",

The updated version of the show, called Jedi Training - Trials of the Temple, uses the theme if Darth Maul appears instead of Kylo Ren in both the Disneyland version and the version shown at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World.

The theme also plays during Soulcalibur IV whenever a player chooses Starkiller and fights within either of the game's two Star Wars-themed stages, as well as during Starkiller's extended ending. The piece is also included at the end of a Verizon Wireless commercial that features R2-D2 as a promotion for the release of The Phantom Menace in 3-D.

        "content": "# Duel of the Fates - Video games[]\n\nThe piece made its first video game appearance in the Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game during the game's last mission, titled \"The Final Battle,\" detailing the duel between Maul, Kenobi, and Jinn. A completely electronic version of the theme is used in the main menu for the 1999 Game Boy Color game Star Wars: Episode I Racer, though the original recording is used in other versions of the game with the vocals cut. It also appears in the opening cinematic for Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles (2000), as well as that game's tenth mission, The Final Battle. The theme makes an appearance in the main menu of the game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo (2000) and during the game's second bonus mission. The composition is utilized in Star Wars: Starfighter (2001) during \"The Final Assault\" as rookie pilot Rhys Dallows dogfights a mercenary leader in the space battle above Naboo. The motif is also used in the 2001 real-time strategy video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its expansion pack Clone Campaigns, released in 2002. The composition is included in the level \"Darth Maul\" on the game Star Wars: Obi-Wan (2001). Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter (2002) uses different variations on the theme from various The Phantom Menace tracks in \"Training Mission 5: Force Powers,\" \"Mission 5: Poisoned Skies,\" \"Mission 7:Hammer and Anvil,\" \"Mission 8: Demolition Squad,\" \"Mission 13: Attack of the Clones,\" and \"Mission 15: The Jedi Master.\" The 2003 video game Star Wars: The Clone Wars uses the piece in \"Mission 3: The Battle of Geonosis\" as you assist in bringing down the second core ship, in \"Mission 7: The Conquest of Raxus Prime\" as you escort reinforcements, and in \"Mission 16: Fate of the Republic\" as you fight the Dark Reaper. It can also be heard during the climactic battle between a spacer and Lord Vartonis in Trials of Obi-Wan (2005), the third expansion of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. Also in Galaxies, players can choose to play \"Duel of the Fates\" from a jukebox playlist. The theme is utilized in the sixth level of \"Episode I\"\u2014titled \"Darth Maul\"\u2014in the non-canon video game LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game (2005), and in the sixth level of the same name in the non-canon LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga (2007). It appears twice in the Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith video game (2005), once in an introductory cinematic sequence featuring Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker fighting in numerous story levels and again as the first piece that plays during the game's version of the Duel on Mustafar. It also appears in the GBA and DS versions for the same game, specifically during the Duel on Mustafar level, although its exact version varied: The former had a synthesized version of the theme being played as depicted from the film, and the latter had the vocals, although based on the version from Attack of the Clones.\n\nIt plays as Galen Marek fights PROXY, who is disguised as Darth Maul on Raxus Prime in the game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008). In the online game Ace Assault II (2011), the theme plays in levels four, ten, and sixteen, which pits Anakin Skywalker against Separatist commanders Grievous and Asajj Ventress and Jedi Master Mace Windu against the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. A few sections from the composition were included in the Return trailer for the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic (2011) during a lightsaber duel between the Jedi Satele Shan and Kao Cen Darach and the Sith Darth Malgus and Vindican. The MMORPG utilizes a cut from the track \"Qui-Gon's Noble End\" that contains the theme whenever a gamer playing as a Sith Warrior takes off in his or her starship. A brief motif is also used when the Sith Inquisitor character kills Darth Zash and takes control of her Sith apprentices. The game Kinect Star Wars (2012) contains a game mode called \"Duel of Fates.\" In the mode, players combat Sith or other sword-wielding opponents with a lightsaber. The game also features a dance move in the song \"Hologram Girl\" in the game's \"Galactic Dance Off\" mode titled \"Duel of Fates.\" The move consists of arching one's left hand over their head while extending their right hand away from their body and facing their right palm out and perpendicular to their arm. The dancer then nods their head as it faces right on beats two and three. Next, the dancer hops to the right and switches arm positions so that the left hand is now extended and the right is arched. The head turns and faces left before nodding on beats two and three again. An edited version is played on the boss battle levels of Angry Birds Star Wars II and on the main menu of \"The Pork Side,\" the half of the game where the player plays for the dark side.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars Main Title - Similarities with other compositions[]\n\nMany people claim that John Williams' scores for the Star Wars saga (mainly the Original Trilogy) are very similar to (or even plagiarized from) other composers' works. One such connection has been made between the \"Star Wars Main Title\" and the main theme from the Golden Age film \"King's Row\" by Erich Korngold. The two themes share similar melodies and orchestration, with the first eight notes being identical, though the last three in \"King's Row\" are played slower than in the \"Main Title\". The two melodies then go in different directions. The \"Star Wars Main Theme\" resembles many \"heroic\" melodies, such as the \"Siegfried Horn Call\" from Wagner's Ring Cycle. Sections of the motif can also be heard in Carl Nielsen's Fifth Symphony. Curiously, the London Symphony Orchestra, who recorded the Star Wars soundtrack, had recorded the first complete Nielsen Symphony cycle under Danish conductor Ole Schmidt just the year before Star Wars. Also of interest is the Paramount Pictures 'logo theme' which shares the first (and only) six notes of this theme in a faster, sped up version.\n\n",

It also appears in the episode Slaves of the Republic when Anakin signals R2-D2.\n\nThis theme is also played during the opening crawl of almost all Star Wars video games. Commonly they use the original version, segueing directly into \"Rebel Blockade Runner\". A notable exception is the opening crawl of Star Wars: TIE Fighter, which features a version of \"The Imperial March.\"\n\nThe theme appears in all three of the LEGO Star Wars games as well as all four Battlefront games. It makes an appearance in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds along with its expansion pack. The theme is also played in Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II and Jedi Outcast. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Sith Lords contain the theme. The theme also makes an appearance in Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter, Star Wars: Starfighter, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, and Star Wars:The Clone Wars. The title also appears in the The Clone Wars games Republic Heroes, Jedi Alliance, and Lightsaber Duels.\n\nThe theme also appears in all the videogames published in 1970s and 1980s, but as many not connected notes.\n\nLeia Organa sings a song for the Life Day celebration in The Star Wars Holiday Special, very similar in tune to the Theme. This is a superficial indication that \"Star Wars Theme\" exists in-universe. Some of the lyrics to this song include:\n\nIn the first episode of the Star Wars radio drama adaptation, the theme is used as background music for an Imperial Academy recruitment commercial which Luke Skywalker listens to in his home on Tatooine.\n\nSimilar indications exist with \"Imperial March\" (implied in The Paradise Snare to be the official in-universe martial anthem of the Imperial Navy) and \"Duel of the Fates\" (heard from ghastly voices in the Ice Crypts of Coruscant).\n\n",

The theme makes an additional appearance in the track \"Fighting The Destroyer Droids\" on the Ultimate Edition soundtrack. In the Attack of the Clones soundtrack and Revenge of the Sith soundtrack, the theme only appears in the opening crawl and the end credits.

        "content": "# Star Wars Main Title - In popular culture[]\n\nThe \"Main Title\" has become one of the most recognized theatrical themes ever written.\n\nOn the January 21, 1978 episode of Saturday Night Live, Bill Murray's lounge singer character sang a version of the Star Wars theme with lyrics. In the same month, the Star Wars theme featured at the Hong Kong Ready-to-Wear Festival during a marching showcase of children's clothing on the catwalk.\n\nThe piece was also performed after the 20th Century Fox Fanfare in set one of the international tour of Star Wars: In Concert. The concerts were conducted by Dirk Brosse. The theme appears in the end credits of the special Robot Chicken: Star Wars, where it is sung by chickens. Disco artist Meco released a disco version of the theme in 1977 on the album Star Wars and other Galactic Funk. It reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on October 1. It held that position for two weeks. The single became the biggest-selling instrumental single in the history of recorded music, being the first to be certified platinum (2 million units) by the RIAA. Meco's version eventually was used officially in the Star Wars franchise with Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, where it played in the arcade mode of the game upon approaching the arcade cabinets. Similarly, it also played when pressing certain buttons on Kamino in the game LEGO: Star Wars.\n\nIt has also been heard in The Lego Movie when Emmett and the Master Builders are arguing how to access Lord Business' tower.\n\n",

When creating the main theme for the film, John Williams attempted to compose a piece with an \"idealistic, uplifting but military flare [sic] to it.\" He wanted the theme to mainly feature the strong brass section of the London Symphony Orchestra, as he himself played brass when he was young. He tried to set it in the most \"brilliant register of the trumpets, horns and trombones\" in order to have a \"blazingly brilliant fanfare\" at the start of the piece, and thus the score. He also did this in order to have the title contrast with the second theme which was more lyrical, adventurous, and romantic in style.\n\n",

        "content": "# Duel of the Fates - In the movies[]\n\n\"Duel of the Fates\" is first played in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The \"Duel of the Fates\" scene, so named in the menus for the DVD version of the film, is the scene where the Jedi characters Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi duel the Sith Lord Darth Maul in the Theed power generator on the planet Naboo. It is played in instrumental form as another major character, Queen Amidala, is ambushed along with her guards by battle droids with rolling capabilities and shields called droidekas in the Theed Hangar, and as Darth Maul and the Jedi activate their lightsabers at the commence of their duel. It is used again as the duel moves from the hangar to a generator complex. The cue comes to an end as plasma shields separate the three combatants for the first time; however, the theme appears shortly after as the youngling Anakin Skywalker destroys the droid control ship above the planet. The original recording is used during the film's end credits.\n\nIn Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, the piece is played when the Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker travels across the surface of the planet Tatooine to search for his mother, Shmi Skywalker Lars, and rescue her from her captors, a tribe of a species called Tusken Raiders.\n\nIn Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the theme is used as the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker crash-lands the Invisible Hand on Coruscant, where an excerpt from the music used when Skywalker destroys the control ship in The Phantom Menace is utilized. \"Duel of the Fates\" is played for the final time during the middle of the film's climax as Darth Vader duels against his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar, as well as during Yoda's attempt to kill Darth Sidious in the Galactic Senate Chamber in an effort to bring his reign to an end and save the Galactic Republic. The piece concludes as Yoda falls from the Chancellor's podium.\n\nIn the 2018 Anthology film, Solo: A Star Wars Story, the theme briefly recurs as Maul, revealed as the secret leader of Crimson Dawn, instructs Qi'ra to begin dealing with him more personally. While the theme appears briefly in the film, a longer statement is played in the deluxe edition of the soundtrack.\n\n",

The film scripts refer to this opening theme as \"war drums.\" It was composed by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. It quickly became one of the most recognizable theatrical motifs in the history of film.\n\nThe \"Main Title\" segues directly into a piece created specifically for each film. These are: \"The Arrival at Naboo\" or \"Boarding the Federation Battleship\" (Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace); \"Ambush on Coruscant\" (Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones); \"The Revenge of the Sith\" (Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith); \"Rebel Blockade Runner\" (Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope), which goes on to quote the ending of \"Mars\" from Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\"; \"The Ice Planet Hoth\" (Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back); \"Approaching the Death Star\" (Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi); \"The Attack on the Jakku Village\" (Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens). \"Main Title and Escape\" (Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi). \"Fanfare and Prologue\" (Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker).\n\nThe theme is described by John Williams as representing the ideas of heroism and adventure, both of which are prominent throughout the films. He used numerous musical phrases to accent certain steps in the hero cycle, depicting the tales of Luke Skywalker, the protagonist in the original trilogy. He used mainly brass to give the theme a majestic feel.\n\nThe theme seems to appear in-universe during a celebration of Life Day, in which Princess Leia sings a tune similar to the theme.\n\n",

A completely electronic version of the theme is used in the main menu for the 1999 Game Boy Color game Star Wars: Episode I Racer, though the original recording is used in other versions of the game with the vocals cut. It also appears in the opening cinematic for Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles (2000), as well as that game's tenth mission, The Final Battle. The theme makes an appearance in the main menu of the game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo (2000) and during the game's second bonus mission. The composition is utilized in Star Wars: Starfighter (2001) during \"The Final Assault\" as rookie pilot Rhys Dallows dogfights a mercenary leader in the space battle above Naboo. The motif is also used in the 2001 real-time strategy video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its expansion pack Clone Campaigns, released in 2002. The composition is included in the level \"Darth Maul\" on the game Star Wars: Obi-Wan (2001). Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter (2002) uses different variations on the theme from various The Phantom Menace tracks in \"Training Mission 5: Force Powers,\" \"Mission 5: Poisoned Skies,\" \"Mission 7:Hammer and Anvil,\" \"Mission 8: Demolition Squad,\" \"Mission 13: Attack of the Clones,\" and \"Mission 15: The Jedi Master.\" The 2003 video game Star Wars: The Clone Wars uses the piece in \"Mission 3: The Battle of Geonosis\" as you assist in bringing down the second core ship, in \"Mission 7: The Conquest of Raxus Prime\" as you escort reinforcements, and in \"Mission 16: Fate of the Republic\" as you fight the Dark Reaper. It can also be heard during the climactic battle between a spacer and Lord Vartonis in Trials of Obi-Wan (2005), the third expansion of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. Also in Galaxies, players can choose to play \"Duel of the Fates\" from a jukebox playlist. The theme is utilized in the sixth level of \"Episode I\"\u2014titled \"Darth Maul\"\u2014in the non-canon video game LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game (2005), and in the sixth level of the same name in the non-canon LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga (2007). It appears twice in the Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith video game (2005), once in an introductory cinematic sequence featuring Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker fighting in numerous story levels and again as the first piece that plays during the game's version of the Duel on Mustafar. It also appears in the GBA and DS versions for the same game, specifically during the Duel on Mustafar level, although its exact version varied: The former had a synthesized version of the theme being played as depicted from the film, and the latter had the vocals, although based on the version from Attack of the Clones.",

Track number twelve, \"Love Pledge and The Arena,\" utilizes the motif three times. The first occurrence is from twelve seconds in to one minute and forty-eight seconds in. The second and third are at six minutes and nine seconds and seven minutes and eleven seconds respectively. The composition makes its final two Attack of the Clones appearances three minutes and fifty-eight seconds and five minutes and thirty-six seconds into the last track, \"Confrontation with Count Dooku and Finale.\"\n\nThe theme is reused in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, notably twenty-five seconds into. \"Anakin's Dream.\"\n\n",

Along with Matthew Wood, David W. Collins worked on the sound for the holiday special at Skywalker Sound. The Keeper of the Holocron, Leland Chee, also composed the lyrics to the song \"Joh Blastoh,\" a contribution which he stated might end up being the personal highlight of his career. Chee later changed his Twitter header image to that of Finn preparing to sing on the Holiday Special, and his Twitter account status to \"Huttese songwriter\".\n\nUsing mainly LEGO CGI assets, the special stars voice talents from performers who worked on Star Wars films and television series, including Anthony Daniels, Billy Dee Williams, James Arnold Taylor, Tom Kane, and Kelly Marie Tran. Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the films, didn't reprise his role in the special because he was never asked to do so and, in his words, to not tarnish the original special's status, being replaced by Eric Bauza.\n\nThe 2020 LEGO Star Wars Advent Calendar was designed in concert with the development and production of the show, the two influencing each other. The figures and trinklets included in the product directly takes from the Holiday Special.\n\n",

        "content": "# The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special - Conception[]\n\nNever officially released by Lucasfilm after its one-time airing on television in 1978, The Star Wars Holiday Special, albeit widely maligned, introduced elements such as Life Day that lingers with the Star Wars franchise and are included in canon. In late 2019, Jon Favreau expressed his interest in making another Holiday Special, musing that he could pitch the idea for a release on the new Disney+ streaming platform, having included a reference to Life Day in the first episode of The Mandalorian. Eventually, Lucasfilm found itself talking about holiday specials, and the heritage of coming together and watching holiday specials every year, as well as how beloved and timeless such things are. The company was in the talks of creating a new one when LEGO Star Wars sought new creative approaches on Disney+, and, seeing that the LEGO Star Wars galaxy allowed stories to have a playful tone that would connect with families, a LEGO Star Wars special came into the making.\n\nThe creative team on the special took inspiration from their own favorite holiday classics, such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, as well as by observing how children played with LEGO Star Wars. Finding that children made use of all elements of the franchise, mixing LEGO from different Star Wars time periods, James Waugh and Josh Rimes\u2014vice president managing franchise content and strategy and director of animation development at Lucasfilm, respectively\u2014discussed how a story could be crafted that allowed for such integration. The goal for the holiday special thus became to bring over 40 years of Star Wars together, and a 'bucket dump' moment was envisioned for it. Waugh and Rimes hope The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special would be timeless despite the current age of nonstop content, becoming a tradition celebrated alongside Rudolph and Frosty for people who love Star Wars, LEGO, and holiday specials.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Background[]\n\nDevelopment of the Special Edition soundtrack release continued with the second Original Trilogy film, The Empire Strikes Back. Once again, Michael Matessino's intention for this release was to present the score in as complete and chronological a fashion as possible. Early on in development of the set, an incomplete set of 24-track masters were discovered, which had been completely missing during development of the 4-cd set. Unfortunately, these masters did not include Eric Tomlinson's original film mixes, meaning the cues would need to be remixed. Due to the large increase in sound quality the master tapes afforded, the decision was made to use them, and engineer Brian Risner was only given six hours to remix all of the cues on the tapes. One of the most common criticisms of the set after it released was that the remixed cues were far too narrow in their stereo separation, in other words instruments that should have been panned to the left or right were panned to the center.\n\nCues that were not on the incomplete set of 24-track tapes were instead sourced from lower-generation backup session tapes, film stems, and the original LP masters. Cues originating from these sources utilize their original Eric Tomlinson mixes instead of having been remixed by Brian Risner. As a result, about half of the cues on the final album ended up being remixed, and about half of them didn't. Cues that were remixed by Brian Risner are marked with a \"%\" symbol in the below track listing.\n\nIn 2004, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of the Special Edition Star Wars trilogy, including The Empire Strikes Back. The set was released with new art work mirroring the film's first DVD release, and without the liner notes. The set was advertised as being processed by Sony's proprietary DSD (Direct Stream Digital) technology, but the final tracks on the 2004 set are exactly the same as those on the 1997 set.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score\n\nThe musical scores for all the Star Wars Episodes were composed by John Williams. The scores of the spin-offs have been written by various different composers. The music for the films are especially distinctive as it has been known to paint musical pictures of such accessibility and precision, and Williams's invaluable contribution to the Star Wars saga and story films stands as an unsurpassed feat in the history of film scoring in terms of breadth, thematic-development and cultural impact.\n\nThe scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles, many culled from the Late Romantic idiom of Richard Strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the Golden Age Hollywood scores of Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Max Steiner.\n\nThe temporary soundtrack that George Lucas suggested to John Williams for the first Star Wars movie featured Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Richard Wagner. Williams tapped into a familiar Romantic idiom (melodic, tonal and acoustic) known to involve Lucas's desire to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in well-known, audience-accessible music. Indeed, much of the trilogy's success relies not on advanced visual effects, but on the simple, direct emotional appeal of its plot, characters, and, importantly, music.\n\nWhile several obvious nods to Holst, Walton, and Stravinsky exist in the score to A New Hope, Williams relied less and less on classical references in the latter five scores, incorporating more strains of modernist orchestral writing with each progressive score.\n\nAccording to Joel McNeely, 19th-century European classical music is the foundation of the best film music since the 1950s. However, Star Wars is often credited as heralding the beginning of a revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s; the popularity and impact of the scores was a major contribution. One technique in particular has had a particular influence: Williams's revival of a technique called \"leitmotif\", which is most famously associated with the operas of Wagner and, in film scores, with Steiner. A leitmotif is a phrase or melodic cell that signifies a character, place, plot element, mood, idea, relationship, or other specific part of the film. It is commonly used in modern film scoring, as a device to mentally anchor certain parts of a film to the soundtrack. Of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development.\n\n",

According to sound editor Ren Klyce, director Rian Johnson convinced Williams to perform the piece for solo piano as an Easter egg for inclusion in the film.\n\nIt can be heard in the final cut of the The Last Jedi at 1:07:42 beginning with a close-up shot of a tea cup. Much of the music is drowned out by the sound effects for the stampede of the fathiers, but several seconds more of the piece can be heard without the sound effects in the \"Score-Only\" version of the film originally exclusive to the Movies Anywhere streaming service and eventually included in the extras for the film on Disney+.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score - First appearance in Episode III[]\n\nBattle of the Heroes theme (III and VIII). The theme for the climactic, apocalyptic duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan. The piece starts off with stridently syncopated strings, immediately joined by horns and a choir that heralds the main phrase: an ascending and descending motif that ends in a cliffhanger. At first, the theme may seem incomplete, but this suits the background of the scene which it supports: the climactic and uncertain duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan. The piece crescendos with rumbling drums, swirling harps and crashing cymbals into the middle part. The vigorous and pulsating choral echoes a fierce and relentless duel. The second part repeats the main phrase, as well as featuring the Force theme, which binds this piece to the rest of the saga's music. Battle of the Heroes ends with a thunderous, though false ending, then the manic strings from the beginning are heard again before finally coming to a rumbling conclusion. It is developed substantially during the final battle in a variety of guises.\nAnakin's Betrayal (III and IX). The music played during the Order 66 sequence, and again during Anakin's final confrontation with Padm\u00e9. Melodic contour links with \"Anakin's Descent Motif.\"\nAnakin's Dark Deeds (III and VIII). The music played during the scene of the killing of the Separatist Council by Darth Vader, his emotional struggle with the dark side, and to some extent Palpatine's transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire.\nGrand Army of the Republic Theme/Arena Theme (III). Major key, predominantly brass theme. Symbolizing the clone troopers and the Republic military. Occurs initially with the introduction to the Battle of Kashyyyk, later with the siege of the Jedi Temple and the Republic's victory in the Battle of Utapau.\nGeneral Grievous' Theme (III). Plodding, over-dotted theme that occurs with introduction of General Grievous, given extended treatment during his arrival on Utapau and reoccurs during beginning of lightsaber fight with Obi-Wan.\nLegend of the Sith (III and IX). A hypothetical motif that occurs subtly in the Palpatine seduction scene. It also heard at the beginning of Episode IX during scene of Kylo and Palpatine meeting.\nArrival Theme (III). Unreleased theme, given full treatment during cue \"Another Happy Landing\" which accompanies the successful landing on Coruscant. Also heard as Obi-Wan arrives at Utapau, again as he leaves Tion Medon.\nPadm\u00e9's Ruminations (III). Heard before Mace Windu's battle with Darth Sidious.\n\n",

A leitmotif first appears as the \"hesitance sarabande,\" representing Luke Skywalker's hesitance to join the fight against the First Order. The motif later sounds as a fanfare during a montage of the Jedi exile's life on Ahch-To.\nDesperation Motif (VIII). A rhythmically unstable motif that represents the struggle of the characters within the story.\nLast-ditch fanfare (VIII). A fanfare that appears in scenes, that involve the Resistance making a last-ditch effort.\nHesitance Sarabande (VIII). A Sarabande that represents Luke's hesitance to join the fight.\nHoldo's Theme (VIII). The Theme for the Resistance Admiral's most notable appearance is while she performs the Holdo maneuver.\nLuke's Interference (VIII). This Do-So-Me-Do motif was heard, prior to the release of the film, in the trailers, but also appears right before Luke engages Kylo Ren on Crait.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score - First appearance in Episode I[]\n\nAnakin's Theme (I, II and III). A tender, beautiful theme, with a tragic and sickening flaw\u2014it represents the innocent, boyish Anakin, but, like him, it contains evil. The theme, if listened to carefully, follows the Imperial March, and ends with a number of subtle renditions of phrases from that theme, and foreshadows what will ultimately come to pass. Development is limited almost exclusively to Episode I, with a small handful of renditions in Episode II and a single, tortured rendition in Episode III.\nDroid Invasion Theme (I, II, and III). Also known as the Trade Federation March, it is played various times in Episode I as the droid armies of the Trade Federation attack Naboo. In Episode II, it is used to represent the Clones, who will eventually come to replace the droids as the Empire's soldiers of choice. A variation of the theme known as \"Activate the Droids\" is played in the Arena Battle, and also heard in the Battle of Kashyyyk. A similar theme, regarded as a variation, was written for the arena scenes in Episode II, but was mostly unused. This rendition is tracked into Episode III during the arrival at Kashyyyk and Anakin's march on the Jedi Temple.\nDuel of the Fates (I, II, III and S). This symphonic piece is played with a full orchestra, as well as choir that chants an archaic Celtic poem \"Gad Goddue\" (Battle of the Trees) in Sanskrit. In English, the poem (or line that Williams uses) reads: \"Under the tongue root a fight most dread, and another raging behind, in the head.\" In Episode I, it is played near the end during the fight with Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul, and developed substantially in music that didn't make the final cut of the film. In Episode II, it is played when Anakin goes off to search for his mother, again representing a key point in determining Anakin's fate. In Episode III, it is played when Yoda fights Emperor Palpatine, in the final battle that could change the destiny of the galaxy.\nShmi's Theme (I and II). Oboe melody heard when Anakin departs from his mother in Episode I, and again at the moment of her death in Episode II.\nFuneral Theme (I and III). Another setting of poetry in Sanskrit. Heard briefly during Qui-Gon's funeral in Episode I, and in Episode III during the death of Padm\u00e9 and the \"rebirth\" of Darth Vader in his suit. A softer version without a choir is played Padm\u00e9's funeral procession, and becomes thunderous, blended with Imperial March during the shot of the skeletal Death Star.\nQui-Gon's Theme (I). Heard three times in film, during beginning of \"Leaving Home\" cue, the desert duel with Maul, and at the end of the Battle of Naboo. It only appeared in the Ultimate Edition of the released Soundtrack.\nJar Jar's Theme (I). A Theme for the clumsy Character Jar Jar. Heard when he is introducing himself to Padm\u00e9 on the ship, and when he is chasing the pit droid in Watto's shop.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score - First appearance in Episode VI[]\n\nJabba's Theme (VI and I; IV in post-1997 releases). A rolling, bulbous tuba theme for the slug-like Jabba the Hutt, it is played often during the opening act of Episode VI, which takes place at Jabba's Palace, and then again, masked but clearly there, in grandiose fashion during the Pod Race sequence in Episode I.\nThe Emperor's Theme (VI, I, II, III, VIII and IX). The theme for Darth Sidious, who then becomes Emperor Palpatine, and to a lesser extent also represents the Dark Side of the Force. A relatively simple chord progression, it is often sung by a male choir, or played on a deep instrument such as a bassoon. In Episodes I and II, it is used to represent the growing power of the mysterious Darth Sidious, and in Episode III it is played as Sidious' true identity is unmasked and he lays the foundation for the Empire. In Episode I, it is also used\u2014albeit sped up and in a major key, and sung by children\u2014during the victory celebrations at the end of the film. In Episode VI, it is used to represent the Emperor, and plays whenever he is on screen.\nThe Ewoks Theme or Parade of the Ewoks (VI). It is the theme for the Ewoks, who live on the forest moon of Endor. It is played at the Ewok village, during the forest battle and in the End Credits of Episode VI.\nLuke and Leia (VI, VIII and IX). The theme for the link between Leia and her brother Luke. Heard in Episode VI only twice in the actual film; the concert suite that Williams composed for it is clearly longer than the sum of its uses. Composed in the Romantic tradition, it is tragic, spirited and uplifting all at once.\nEwok Celebration (VI, elements in I). The song that was played before the credits in the original version of Episode VI. It mostly uses primitive percussion instruments, reflecting the crude technology of the Ewoks. The lyrics of this theme are sung entirely in Ewokese, which was not restricted to set words during its creation. In the re-release of Episode VI, it was replaced in the 1997 special editions by a piece known as \"Victory Celebration\", which is scored for full orchestra and choir. Elements of this theme are likely present in the parade scene of Episode I.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score - First appearance in Episode IV[]\n\nStar Wars Main Title or Luke's Theme (all episodes and spin-offs). The \"anthem\" of the saga, Williams's instantly recognizable main theme is variously associated with Luke, heroism and adventure. It is heard in full Korngoldian splendor over the opening crawl at the beginning of all the films, and part of the music is heard over the credits. Most prominent in the first film (Episode IV) in which strong brass treat it as a fanfare of sorts for Luke, the theme is relied upon less and less frequently throughout subsequent films, though its emotional impact is always pronounced. Except for the final scene of Episode III, Williams's use of the Main Theme in the prequels is limited mostly to the title crawl and short, sometimes disguised fragments.\n\nRebel Fanfare (all episodes and spin-offs). This short motif is used extensively in Episode IV to represent the Rebel Alliance. It is used occasionally in Episodes III and V for this purpose as well. The theme itself is constructed out of brassy major block chords that progress in parallel motion through intervals of a third, resulting in an appropriate heraldic flavor. In the radio dramatization of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope the Rebel Fanfare was used as the backing music for the Imperial recruitment tape that Luke listens to in \"A Wind to Shake the Stars.\" In the transcript for \"Black Knight, White Princess, and Pawns,\" it was identified as \"Vader's music.\"\nThe Force Theme or Ben Kenobi's theme or Jedi Knights and the Old Republic theme (all episodes and RO). This theme represents Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi and most importantly the Force from which they draw their power. It also often represents the twin themes of destiny and fate that are important in all the films. It is the most commonly heard and prominent theme over the six films as a whole, and undergoes substantial development especially in the prequel trilogy.\nPrincess Leia's Theme (III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and RO). A romantic theme for Princess Leia, one of the central protagonists of the Original Trilogy. This theme represents her \"innocence\", and hence is most often heard in Episode IV, but is used in the next two films when she is acting on her own or when she is particularly vulnerable. It is heard prominently in Episode III after she is born. Williams made an extended concert version of this theme that is performed frequently.\nImperial motif (IV, RO and S). Not to be confused with the Imperial March, this motif represents the Empire and Darth Vader strictly in Episode IV (although it was referenced on numerous occasions), before the much more popular Imperial March was written. Vaguely militaristic, it is generally played by bassoons or muted trombones, and for its brevity and limited melodic scope, is not nearly as successful at conjuring dread as the Imperial March.\nThe Death Star motif (IV, VI, VIII, RO and S). An imposing four chord motif, played six times during Episode IV, that either heralds a shot of the Death Star, or is played when that place's presence is suggested (for example when a ship is going to fly there). Also heard in Episode VI, though through music that was adapted from the first film. In RO it appeared as it was intended by Williams, while S quoted it probably for the sake of nostalgia.\nJawa Theme (IV). A jaunty theme used in Episode IV when the droids land on Tatooine, and then for much of the following half hour of the film. It is mostly associated with the oboe and English horn.\nTatooine motif (IV, I, II). This motif borrowed heavily from Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, little more than a melodic contour (up by small interval, down by big interval) that crops up with wide shots of arrival on Tatooine.\nVictory March (IV, VI). Walton-esque music played during the medal ceremony at the end of Episode IV. Williams develops it into a set of chromatic variations during the scene in Return of the Jedi in which the Rebel fleet takes off into hyperspace. A longer rendition was written and recorded later. This extended version was also recorded for the album version of the end credits for Episode III.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score - First appearance in Episode V[]\n\nThe Imperial March or Darth Vader's theme (V, VI, I, II, III, VII, RO, VIII, S and IX). The theme that represents the authoritarian Galactic Empire as a whole, and Darth Vader specifically. It is so successful that it has entered the Western consciousness as a general \"evil theme\", and as such is played at a huge variety of public events. In the Prequel Trilogy, it is subtly at first, being partially embedded in Anakin's innocent theme, though with progressive prominence it is heard through Episodes II and III, signaling critical points in Anakin's downward spiral to the dark side, as well as the rise of the Empire. Examples of the latter include the piece played at the end of Episode II when the Republic military is boarding assault ships and in Episode III when the Republic AT-RTs are scouting Kashyyyk for Jedi survivors. In the Original Trilogy, The Imperial March also represents all that is the Empire; therefore, it is nearly equivalent to a galactic anthem. Its first appearance is played by a solo piccolo. It is played one final time during Vader's death in Episode VI, tenderly on harp, as finally Vader returns to the light of the Force. It is absent from Episode IV simply because Willams hadn't written it until Episode V, and then kept it onwards. The motif appears once in Episode VII, closing the scene in which Kylo Ren is addressing Darth Vader's disfigured mask. The motif also appears briefly in Episode VIII in the initial throne room sequence between Snoke and Kylo Ren as Snoke mentions the fact that his goal was to groom Kylo Ren to be the next Darth Vader.\nHan Solo and the Princess or the Love theme (V, VI, VII, VIII and IX). A theme for the love between Han Solo and Princess Leia. Heard in Episodes V and VI, and often used in not only scenes of romance but also scenes of sacrifice from the two characters.\nYoda's Theme (V, VI, I, II, III, VIII and IX). A theme meant to represent the age and gentle wisdom of Jedi Master Yoda, who appears in five of the six films along with his music. Played often when the diminutive green character is on screen, particularly when he is either using or teaching about the Force, it is often used when his presence is implied, or his influence felt (such as during the Cloud City sequence in Episode V). Used more sparingly in the Prequel Trilogy, though certain moments, such as Yoda's duel with Count Dooku and his departure from Kashyyyk, highlight the theme quite prominently.\nDroids motif (V). A short playful motif associated with C-3PO and R2-D2. Fairly prominent in several scenes on Hoth, Dagobah, and during the climactic \"Hyperspace\" cue at the end of the film. The motif is not heard in any other film.\nBoba Fett motif (V). A descending two-note bassoon phrase relating to the quiet menace of bounty hunter Boba Fett. It is played three times in Episode V (when we see Boba Fett in Vader's Starship; when he goes after the Millennium Falcon (just after the Asteroid Field sequence); and when Lando betrays his friends in Cloud City. Linked with Boba Fett's theme (Episode V).\nLando's March or the Cloud City march (V). This theme is heard a few times in Lando's Palace during the Bespin sequences of Episode V. It is a march in Major mode.\nA recurring, untitled motif during the final Cloud City sequences is also present, though it has not been described as being connected to any particular character, location or idea. Described as an 'ascending horn and wind motif' in the Special Edition soundtrack liner notes, this motif is heard during some scenes involving Boba Fett, leading to the wide but unfounded belief that it is a second theme for the bounty hunter. There is some outward similarity between the two themes, but this may be coincidental.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score - First appearance in Episode II[]\n\nAcross the Stars (II and III). The broadly romantic theme associated with the forbidden and ill-fated love between Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala. The title is probably a reference to Romeo and Juliet, a story of similar \"star-crossed\" doomed love. It is gentle but with an undercurrent of unease and uncertainty. It is written in the key of D minor, but modulates several times throughout its duration. A secondary theme appears within the concert arrangement, as well as during the Fireplace Scene in Episode II and as Anakin and Padm\u00e9 first meet in Episode III. Arguments have been put forward that in it's melodic and rhythmic structure, the theme bears resemblance to Luke and Leia's themes from the original trilogy, though such features as prominent triplets speak more to common ideas throughout Williams scores (note resemblance to themes from Hook and Nixon, for example).\nConflict motif (II) and Mystery motif (II and III). Brooding minor motif, arguably the same. It has been compared to Across the Stars, and appears to have a similar structure.\nAnakin's Descent motif (II and III). A repeated minor figure, Bb-A-Bb-G-C-A-Bb-G that is given a long sequential treatment in Anakin's Confession scene, and is embedded into \"Anakin's Betrayal.\"\nMystery Motif (II and IX). A series of arpeggiations of a minor chord. Obviously limited in usage. Also played twice during Geonosis scenes, with Count Dooku fleeing in both instances.\nDooku motif (II). A possible motif, roughly D-Eb-C# (a common melodic figuration for Williams) that occurs as a kind of orchestral stinger during a couple of scenes in the latter portions of the film.\nPalpatine's machinations motif (II, III, IX). A motif which relating to the machinations of Darth Sidious.\nMourning Theme (II). Moving theme, with characteristic upward ascending minor 6 in solo horn. Heard at least three times, but given fullest treatment during Shmi's funeral.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score - Accusations of unoriginality[]\n\nWhile immensely popular, many musicians in the classical music community have accused many of Williams's scores\u2014especially from the Star Wars saga\u2014as being unoriginal. Notably, the scores do seem to draw upon elements of composer such as Holst, Mahler, and, of course, Wagner's operas. The Wagnerian parallel is most easily drawn, with the saga's leitmotifs, heavy use of brass, heroic themes, and perfect intervals.\n\nOne of the most notable examples that is often cited is the track \"Main Title/Rebel Blockade Runner\" from A New Hope; some claim that the 5/4 ostinato is blatantly borrowed from Holst's Planets Suite. Tutti dissonant chords appear repeatedly throughout the film, and are no doubt intentionally imitating the \"sounds of war\" Holst brought to his composition.\nSome claim that the Star Wars main theme is derivative of the Kings Row film score by Korngold, namely in terms of orchestration and melody.\nMusic from Tatooine is always compared to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, with its heavy use of double reeds over alternating semitones. This theory is supported by reports of Lucas using The Rite in a temp track for the film.\nThe Throne Room seems to be derivative of the Pomp and Circumstance Marches by Edward Elgar. Additionally, a section of Dvorak's New World Symphony seems to be quoted in the melody.\nThe Imperial March is quite similar to Mahler's second \"Resurrection\" symphony, especially in terms of the first few intervals. Coincidentally, Imperial March is also the title of a work by the aforementioned Edward Elgar (Op. 32).\nBattle of the Heroes bears a striking resemblance to the Dies irae in terms of melodic contour. This is appropriate, as the latter is often used in pieces representing armageddon.\n\nTo be fair, Williams was most likely trying to capture a feel that he felt other composers had succeeded to acquire, and it is not beyond the imagination that George Lucas actually requested a score similar to that of other composers.\n\n",

Williams received in February 1978 three Grammys and his third Academy Award in April.\n\nFirst released on LP by 20th Century, John Williams selected seventy-four minutes of music out of the eighty-eight-minute score for the original soundtrack. To provide musical variety, it did not follow the chronological order of the film.\n\nin 1997 (RCA Victor), and 2004 (Sony Classical), respectably, the complete score was released in chronological order for the first time. The two releases present exactly the same track listing. The only difference between these editions is that the RCA release includes complete notes on each track by Michael Matessino and that the Sony Classical release does not include these notes.\n\nNow Available on Walt Disney Records (2018), the latest release is a remastered version of the original soundtrack. supervised by Shawn Murphy and Skywalker Sound, this version was transferred to a new hi-resolution (24/192), and was derived from the original film mixes, not the remixed LP versions, which had been previously released.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope Special Edition: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Background[]\n\nThe idea for the Special Edition soundtrack release began life in 1993 when Michael Matessino (editor of expanded soundtrack releases) and Nick Redman (producer of the 1993 sets) were working on a project together and got to talking about the 1993 sets. Matessino expressed his displeasure at several of his perceived flaws with the 1993 set, including its use of many wrong takes for the cues from the original film, its over-reliance on the original album presentations for the first three discs, and the random order of the fourth, not to mention that there was still over 40 minutes of unreleased music. The rumored fifth disc for the box set might have helped alleviate the last concern except that it had fallen through, and potential plans to release it as a bonus disc with the 1995 widescreen VHS release also never went anywhere. After Lucasfilm began to talk about doing theatrical rereleases of Star Wars, Matessino got his chance. Redman went to Lucasfilm and suggested that they do complete score releases as a tie-in with the Special Edition theatrical releases. Once they got approval they went to work.\n\nMatessino's intention with the sets were to be as complete and chronological as possible. This meant abandoning the original album presentations and trying to include as much material as possible. For the original film, one of the most important things to get right for Matessino was to ensure that all the right takes were used. At the time the sets were first being assembled, the final performance edits and Ken Wannberg's paperwork on which takes to splice together were missing, so Matessino had to do it from scratch by comparing the complete sessions with the film and with the original OST album. Eventually, well into development of the sets Fox archivist Ron Fulgsby managed to find Wannberg's original paperwork (including spotting sheets and recording logs for both Star Wars and ROTJ) and they were able to verify the accuracy of Matessino's edits. The missing 16-track masters with Wannberg's performance edits were never found during development of these sets, but it later turned out that they were in possession of John Neal, the person who remixed the score for its release on the original OST. These 16-track masters eventually found their way onto ebay around 2014, stemming from someone who got them from the John Neal estate. Lukas Kendall of Film Score Monthly would claim that he and Matthew Wood were aware of them, and that they were likely scanned by Lucasfilm.\n\nSince the master tapes were missing, Matessino ended up sourcing most of the Special Edition release from a set of 3-track 35mm mag tapes. He referred to these in the Film Score Monthly article on the Special Edition sets as a second-generation source, but we know from Chris Malone's research and interviews with Alan Snelling that the original sessions were recorded onto two 35mm mag film recorders, one of which was kept as a backup. It's possible that the 1997 sets were either sourced directly from this first-generation set and Matessino misspoke (which the Malone document hints at), or else it's also possible they were sourced from a second-generation copy of this backup set. A couple cues were sourced from the incomplete part of the 16-track masters that they did have, namely the original version of [3m2 Rev.] Lost R2, as well as the first two takes of [1m2] Main Title. Chris Malone speculated in his document that some cues were actually sourced from the same 1993 digital transfers created by Bill Wolford for the boxset due to containing the same 19 KHz tone heard on all cues from the Anthology set, although there is no hard proof that this was the case.\n\n",

        "content": "# Musical score - Accusations of unoriginality[]\n\nWhile immensely popular, many musicians in the classical music community have accused many of Williams's scores\u2014especially from the Star Wars saga\u2014as being unoriginal. Notably, the scores do seem to draw upon elements of composer such as Holst, Mahler, and, of course, Wagner's operas. The Wagnerian parallel is most easily drawn, with the saga's leitmotifs, heavy use of brass, heroic themes, and perfect intervals.\n\nOne of the most notable examples that is often cited is the track \"Main Title/Rebel Blockade Runner\" from A New Hope; some claim that the 5/4 ostinato is blatantly borrowed from Holst's Planets Suite. Tutti dissonant chords appear repeatedly throughout the film, and are no doubt intentionally imitating the \"sounds of war\" Holst brought to his composition.\nSome claim that the Star Wars main theme is derivative of the Kings Row film score by Korngold, namely in terms of orchestration and melody.\nMusic from Tatooine is always compared to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, with its heavy use of double reeds over alternating semitones. This theory is supported by reports of Lucas using The Rite in a temp track for the film.\nThe Throne Room seems to be derivative of the Pomp and Circumstance Marches by Edward Elgar. Additionally, a section of Dvorak's New World Symphony seems to be quoted in the melody.\nThe Imperial March is quite similar to Mahler's second \"Resurrection\" symphony, especially in terms of the first few intervals. Coincidentally, Imperial March is also the title of a work by the aforementioned Edward Elgar (Op. 32).\nBattle of the Heroes bears a striking resemblance to the Dies irae in terms of melodic contour. This is appropriate, as the latter is often used in pieces representing armageddon.\n\nTo be fair, Williams was most likely trying to capture a feel that he felt other composers had succeeded to acquire, and it is not beyond the imagination that George Lucas actually requested a score similar to that of other composers.\n\n",

It was released on December 16, 2016, the same day as the film itself. In addition to developing new themes and motifs such as the The Imperial Suite and the messenger motif, the film score incorporates leitmotifs from John Williams' Star Wars scores, particularly those from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. The Rogue One soundtrack also makes extensive use of dies irae, which forms a significant part of Jyn Erso's theme.\n\nAlthough the musical score does not begin with the \"Star Wars Main Title\" as with the Star Wars saga films, the Main Title is briefly played in the track \"Scrambling the Rebel Fleet,\" when C-3PO and R2-D2 appears on screen. A chorus is used for the tracks \"Your Father Would Be Proud\" and \"Hope,\" which plays in the film as its protagonists and other members of the Rebel Alliance meet their death.\n\nRogue One music is reprised in later Star Wars media; both the hope motif and the leitmotif for the squad Rogue One are played in the LEGO Star Wars: All-Stars episode \"The Good Stuff!.\" The Rogue One theme was also used to introduce Diego Luna (Cassian Jeron Andor) and Alan Tudyk (K-2SO) at D23 Expo 2019 when the pair discussed the upcoming Andor television series.\n\n",

The first performance took place in the O2 Arena in London, England. It was attended by 20,000 fans. The North American concerts started in Anaheim, California on October 1, 2009. The concerts were narrated by Anthony Daniels and conducted by Dirk Brosse. The concert took the audience through the Star Wars story line starting with Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and ending with Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The concert toured throughout the world extensively in 2009 and 2010, with an announced two-date engagement (June 3 and 4, 2011) at the Hollywood Bowl in 2011.\n\nA small exhibit traveled with the show that showcased props from both trilogies, including \"Han Solo in Carbonite\".\n\n",

It is the second installment of the Star Wars Anthology Series. It stars Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo in the years prior to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Donald Glover portrays Lando Calrissian and Joonas Suotamo portrays the Wookiee Chewbacca. Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Thandiwe Newton, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge also star.\n\nThe film was first announced as a Han Solo picture in 2015, along with the news that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller would be the film's directors. Principal photography began in January 2017, after which creative differences arose between the two directors and the studio. They were replaced by Ron Howard, who was tasked with completing principal photography along with what was reported to be extensive re-shoots.\n\nSolo held its world premiere on May 10, 2018 in Los Angeles, and it was screened at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival on May 15. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, music, and visuals, although some felt that the story was weak. Solo received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards.\n\nSolo is the first and only live-action, cinematic-release Star Wars film to not involve space in the title card nor in the first shot other than in the \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\" or preface cards.\n\n",

A side-by-side post demonstrated that the posters and covers feature nearly identical coloration for both the background and character/album names, as well as a similar font. On April 23, a lawsuit was filed by Ren Ventures, who holds the trademark for the card game Sabacc, against Lucasfilm and Denny's Star Wars card game after Sabacc was featured in promotion for the film.\n\n",

While it received its in-universe name, \"Mad About Me,\" from the short story Empire Blues: The Devaronian's Tale in 1995's Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina, it is titled \"Cantina Band\" on the film's many soundtracks. The piece is a rare example of source music in the Star Wars films\u2014music that does not exist out of universe on the soundtrack, but is played diegetically by characters within the film. Alongside its corresponding piece \"Cantina Band #2,\" it is one of only two such cues to appear in A New Hope.\n\nFilmmaker George Lucas initially planned to use Glenn Miller for the cantina sequence in A New Hope, but the music cannot be used for his film. John Williams thus created something familiar, which Lucas described as \"very Forties, yet very odd.\" While the music was originally designed as a big-band number, Lucas thought Williams's music worked well.\n\nLucas also proposed the inclusion of a jitterbug-like piece in the film, along the lines of the music of jazz musician Benny Goodman. As his inspiration, Lucas had the idea of beings in the far future trying to create their own version of Goodman's style of music. John Williams wrote \"Cantina Band\" with this as his basis, scoring it so the instruments sounded somewhat strange, but on the verge of familiarity. To produce the piece, Williams brought in nine jazz musicians, a solo trumpet, two saxophones, a saxophonist who also played clarinet, a Fender Rhodes piano, a Caribbean steel drum, another drum, various percussion instruments, and an ARP synthesizer for the bass. To give the instruments a more alien quality, the music was filtered so the bottom end of the sound was clipped, the lower end was attenuated, and a reverb was added to thin the instruments out.\n\nIn 1977, disco producer Meco created an instrumental piece called \"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band,\" which combined the main theme of the films with \"Cantina Band\" in a disco style. It was released on the album Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk, and on October 1, 1977, it hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for two weeks.\n\nLike many Star Wars cues, \"Cantina Band\" has been used in a number of video games\u2014often as part of the soundtrack, as opposed to source music. In Star Wars: Battlefront II, it appears as part of a medley of unusual Star Wars tracks played during the \"Assault\" mode of the Mos Eisley level of the game's Instant Action feature. LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game plays it on some levels when the player uses the Force on chairs, and its sequel LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy uses \"Cantina Band\" as the background music in the Mos Eisley cantina. The short film LEGO Star Wars: Revenge of the Brick plays it during a cantina scene of its own, reminiscent of the one in A New Hope. Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader plays the piece over its opening LucasArts logo, while dozens of dancing stormtroopers form the logo.\n\nA short variation of the song, played in a quieter classical style, can be heard as part of the music played in and around the Star Tours attraction at Disney theme parks.\n\nThe cue has made several appearances as source music, too. In Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, it is heard in a bar on Nar Shaddaa. This was a first for the Jedi Knight series, as earlier games Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II and Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith use the relatively rarer \"Cantina Band #2\" as their source music. Star Wars Galaxies features both; the two \"Cantina Band\" pieces play on an infinite loop in all cantinas on Tatooine. Additionally, a variation of \"Cantina Band,\" known as \"Starwars2\" in-game, is included as one of the playable songs of the \"Entertainer\" player class. In Star Wars: Yoda Stories, a brief portion of the song is played whenever the player enters any cantina on any planet. Star Wars: Empire at War and its expansion pack play the song as ambient music when the game's camera is moved near a cantina structure on land maps. The Star Wars Holiday Special uses the song in its cantina scene as well; it additionally introduces a version of the piece with lyrics, titled \"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye\" and sung by Bea Arthur. In the DVD releases of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and the original trilogy, the song is used as background music for an Easter egg which plays a blooper reel along with DVD credits.\n\n",

        "content": "# Solo: A Star Wars Story - Production[]\n\nPrincipal photography began in January 2017, with a working title of Star Wars: Red Cup. In addition to Pinewood Studios, the film shot at Fuerteventura, Spain, the Dolomites in Italy and at an undisclosed location near London. One of the three rewards in the 2017 Force for Change fundraiser was a role in the film.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, Lucasfilm announced that directors Lord and Miller were departing from the project due to creative differences and that a new director would be announced soon. Entertainment Weekly reported that Lord and Miller encouraged an improvisational style on set, which Lucasfilm insiders believed was moving the film away from the vision crafted by the Kasdans in their script and ended up significantly changing the story. Lucasfilm believed that these apparent issues could be fixed during reshoots, but Lord and Miller were reportedly reluctant to significantly alter their approach to the film. As a result, Kennedy made the decision to remove Lord and Miller from the production. Co-writer Lawrence Kasadan later attributed it to tone: \"You can have fun with the tone but you never make fun of the tone, in my world.\"\n\nOn June 22, Lucasfilm announced that Ron Howard would take over directorial duties for the film. Howard had worked on three previous Lucasfilm projects: 1973's American Graffiti, 1979's More American Graffiti, and 1988's Willow (which starred Star Wars veteran Warwick Davis, who also appeared in Solo). After the announcement, Howard said that he had been a fan of Star Wars since the beginning and that he found it \"gratifying to be asked to lend my voice to the [Star Wars] universe.\" Michael Kenneth Williams was originally cast in the film but was unavailable for the reshoots, so he was replaced by Paul Bettany. George Lucas visited the set at one point, and helped direct a scene. On October 17, Howard confirmed that production had wrapped up, and he officially announced the title of the film would be Solo: A Star Wars Story. By March 30, 2018, the editing and score were finished, and post-production had ended by April 22. John Powell composed the film's musical score, and John Williams contributed a new theme.\n\n",

Abrams for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released on December 18, 2015. Abrams, who directed the film, planned on creating a sequence to tribute the cantina scene from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, and John Williams, the composer for The Force Awakens, asked Abrams to find someone to write the piece. Shortly after, while at a performance of the musical Hamilton, Abrams was approached by Miranda, Hamilton star and creator, who coincidentally offered to write cantina music if it was needed. Abrams later contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated to write the piece.\n\nWhile writing \"Jabba Flow,\" Miranda referred to a glossary of Huttese terms, the language spoken by Jabba the Hutt, and he compared the translation to \"It Wasn't Me,\" a song by reggae fusion artist Shaggy. From Star Wars Legends material, the lyrics \"No bata tu tu, muni, muni\" directly translate to \"Whatever it is, I didn't do it, lover, lover.\" When the piece was completed, Miranda and Abrams produced and performed it under the stage name Shag Kava, also creating the song \"Dobra Doompa.\" In The Force Awakens, \"Jabba Flow\" is played as Han Solo, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 enter Maz Kanata's castle. Although unidentified in this scene, the track is identified in the film's credits. On February 19, 2016, a remixed version of \"Jabba Flow\" by producers Rick Rubin and A-Trak was included on Star Wars Headspace, a compilation album of Star Wars\u2013themed electronic dance music. Miranda and Abrams performed \"Jabba Flow\" following a performance of Hamilton on May 4, 2016, tying in with the song's digital single release.\n\n",
