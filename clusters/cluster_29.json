At the real-world Oga's Cantina bar, the menu's description reads, \"Lemonade, pomegranate juice, and habanero-lime.\"\n\nBlurrgfire first appeared in \"G-LN,\" a short that aired on December 17, 2018 as part of the first season of the animated television series Star Wars Resistance. During its appearance, Blurrgfire was depicted as a pale orange substance as opposed to the deep red coloring it was depicted with in its other appearances.\n\nA recipe for Blurrgfire is included in the 2019 cookbook Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was written by Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Marc Sumerak with photography by Ted Thomas. The ingredients for the beverage are pomegranate juice, habanero lime syrup, and prepared lemonade; before serving, a lime is run around the rim of a glass which is then dipped in red sea salt.\n\nThe 2020 non-canon video game expansion The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey to Batuu includes Blurrgfire as a drink sold to the player's Sims at the Oga's Cantina vendor in the Black Spire Outpost neighborhood. Upon consuming the drink for the first time, the Sim automatically learns the recipe and can prepare it at mixology bars in their home neighborhood.\n\n",

The dish consists of a beef pot roast with cavatelli pasta, wilted kale, and mushrooms. A recipe for the dish as Braised Shaak Roast is included in the 2019 recipe book Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel.

        "content": "# Fuzzy Tauntaun - Behind the scenes[]\n\nFuzzy Tauntauns were first mentioned in the junior novel Pirate's Price, which was written by Lou Anders and published on January 8, 2019. On February 27 of that year, D23: The Official Disney Fan Club and StarWars.com announced that the beverage, which was first pictured on the latter website, would be sold at the real-world bar Oga's Cantina in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, a themed land that opened at Disneyland Park on May 31 and Disney's Hollywood Studios on August 29 of the same year. The menu's description reads, \"C\u00eeroc Peach Vodka, Bols Peach Schnapps, and Simply Orange\u00ae topped with Tangerine, Pure Cane Sugar, 'Buzzz' Foam.\" The real-world \"buzzz\" is derived from buzz buttons.\n\nThe 2020 non-canon video game expansion The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey to Batuu includes Fuzzy Tauntauns as a drink that the player's Sims can purchase from the Oga's Cantina vendor in the Black Spire Outpost neighborhood. Its price of sixty credits makes it the second most expensive item on the menu. Upon consuming the drink for the first time, the Sim automatically learns the recipe and can prepare it at mixology bars in their home neighborhood.\n\n",
