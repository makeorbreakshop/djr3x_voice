As a new visitor to Batuu, Sims will experience the authentic sights and sounds of the Star Wars universe, including the Millennium Falcon and DJ R-3X's interstellar hits at Oga's Cantina. They'll also embark on exciting missions, unite with iconic characters like Rey and Kylo Ren, and get their hands on their very own lightsaber and droid.\n\nIn The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey to Batuu, players will leave their homes to travel to the planet of Batuu where they'll have to make a choice on which faction to work with, as the actions their Sims take will lead to control of the Black Spire Outpost. Sims can choose to support Rey and Vi Moradi as part of the Resistance, pledge loyalty to the First Order under Kylo Ren or shift their focus to gaining credits with Hondo Ohnaka and the scoundrels. As Sims embark on exciting missions, they'll increase their reputation, unlock new artifacts and one-of-kind clothing, customize their own droids and create a coveted lightsaber. After players leave Batuu and return home, they can even bring back some of these items, like their lightsaber, to enjoy with other Sims they've already created.\n\n",

Although Chewbacca issues quests to the player and is pictured, he is not a character that the player can directly interact with.\n\nPlayers can also shop from the following vendors: Dok-Ondar in his Den of Antiquities, Savi in his workshop, and Mubo in his Droid Depot. Travelers could buy food and drinks from Oga's Cantina, the Milk Stand, and Strono \"Cookie\" Tuggs, along with other restaurants.\n\nThe game includes non-player characters of various species, including Zabraks, Twi'leks, Abednedos, Humans, Biths, and Mirialans. These characters are classified as either bartenders, vendors, scoundrels, lightsaber challengers, and Batuu citizens. Players can interact with these new characters as part of quests, asking them their opinions on Batuu, the Resistance, and the First Order.\n\nPlayers can complete missions to gain reputation with three factions: Scoundrels, the Resistance, and the First Order. Gaining Resistance reputation decreases First Order reputation, and vice-versa. A player's faction affects the Outpost.\n\n",

As a new visitor to Batuu, Sims will experience the authentic sights and sounds of the Star Wars universe, including the Millennium Falcon and DJ R-3X's interstellar hits at Oga's Cantina. They'll also embark on exciting missions, unite with iconic characters like Rey and Kylo Ren, and get their hands on their very own lightsaber and droid.\n\nIn The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey to Batuu, players will leave their homes to travel to the planet of Batuu where they'll have to make a choice on which faction to work with, as the actions their Sims take will lead to control of the Black Spire Outpost. Sims can choose to support Rey and Vi Moradi as part of the Resistance, pledge loyalty to the First Order under Kylo Ren or shift their focus to gaining credits with Hondo Ohnaka and the scoundrels. As Sims embark on exciting missions, they'll increase their reputation, unlock new artifacts and one-of-kind clothing, customize their own droids and create a coveted lightsaber. After players leave Batuu and return home, they can even bring back some of these items, like their lightsaber, to enjoy with other Sims they've already created.\n\n",
