        "content": "# Alliance to Restore the Republic - Age of the Empire[]\n\nIn the absence of any major opposition, the Galactic Empire thrived during the early days of Palpatine's reign, amassing a vast military and using it to instill fear in the civilian population, yet public opinion and the supposed power of the Imperial Senate remained vital until Palpatine could fully cement his power. All the same, the reformed Senate, being even less effective than it was during the last years of the Republic, did nothing to restrain that massive military expansion. Meanwhile, in the deepest secrecy, the Empire worked on the Death Star, a moon-sized battle station capable of destroying entire planets. Although many people held a grudge against the Empire, few dared to act. Those who did often acted solely in their own interests, which actually made it harder for any kind of real, organized rebellion to appear.\n\nA rare example of organized resistance against the Empire was that of Cham Syndulla's Free Ryloth Movement, which wanted to end the Imperial occupation on the planet Ryloth. It was formed from the Twi'lek Resistance, which had resisted the occupation of Ryloth by the Separatists during the Clone Wars. Over the years, the movement established hidden bases across the Ryloth system and executed raids against the Imperials. Meanwhile, Separatist holdouts remained active in the galaxy and continued to fight with hopes of securing independence from Imperial control. The former Separatist capital, Raxus Secundus, was occupied by the Imperial Military, yet that did little to quell the spirit of independence amongst its people.\n\nAs early as circa 18 BBY, rumors swirled that Palpatine was scared about the prospect of planets and whole star systems allying together in the name of overthrowing him. While such a possible rebellion lacked any unifying leaders at that time, Palpatine and his agents were unable to act out in the open because public opinion was still so important to his legitimacy, even if he had the excuse to occupy worlds like Raxus. At that time, a growing number of Pantorans wished for true independence instead of remaining under the Imperial flag. To that end, Pantoran Senator Riyo Chuchi met with the former Separatist Senator of Raxus, Avi Singh, to discuss Palpatine's fears and the prospect of an allied Rebellion. To try and silence a revolution before it began, a clone assassin codenamed CX-1 was dispatched to kill Singh, but his efforts were halted by the Clone Underground, a network of clones who had rebelled against the Empire and hoped to help their brethren.\n\nAnother rebel cell emerged one year after the end of the Clone Wars when the Empire decided to severely punish the world of Antar 4 for its past ties with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. That murderous operation, spearheaded by Wilhuff Tarkin, prompted the former Republic Intelligence agent Berch Teller to found his own resistance cell. Teller hoped they were contributing to what would eventually grow into a cause against the Empire. Four years after its formation, the insurgents managed to steal the Carrion Spike, the personal starship of Tarkin, to attack various Imperial targets with information provided to them by an Imperial traitor, Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit. Teller's insurgents later launched an attack on an Imperial convoy transporting important parts for the Death Star project. Their plans were soon thwarted by Tarkin's timely intervention, which resulted in the killing of every insurgent except Teller.\n\n",

        "content": "# Alliance to Restore the Republic - Delegation of 2,000[]\n\nAlso during the Clone Wars, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine had managed to obtain many emergency powers from the Galactic Senate, which caused certain members of the Chancellor's own Loyalist Committee, including Bail Prestor Organa of Alderaan, Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, and Mon Mothma of Chandrila, to start to complain about the chief of state's conduct. The discontented senatorial representatives ended up forming the Delegation of 2,000. They signed the Petition of 2,000, a document that formally expressed its signatories' concerns with Palpatine's rule and called for him to relinquish his emergency powers as soon as possible. Senator Meena Tills of Mon Cala was among the petitioners.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Clone Wars was brought to an end. Far from relinquishing his dictatorial status, Chancellor Palpatine unilaterally abolished the Republic in front of the whole Senate and anointed himself the Galactic Emperor, thus transforming the democratic government into an authoritarian regime, the Galactic Empire. Unbeknownst to most of the galactic community, the self-promoted Emperor Palpatine was in fact the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who had masterminded the Clone Wars so that he could gain power and overthrow the Republic. The Emperor immediately started to subvert democracy in the galaxy and declared the peacekeeping Jedi Knights enemies of the state. In the immediate aftermath of the Clone Wars and Senator Amidala's death at the hands of her husband, Darth Vader \u2014 the identity adopted by Anakin Skywalker when he became Sidious's Sith apprentice \u2014 Senators Organa and Mothma started working in secret to overthrow the Empire.\n\n",

The Alliance was publicly and formally declared with the Declaration of the Rebel Alliance by Senator Mon Mothma, which brought numerous rebel cells together as a common force opposed to the Empire. Indeed, the concept of a \"Rebel Alliance\" had its roots in smaller movements that had worked to unite disconnected cells, such as a movement secretly led by fellow Senator Bail Prestor Organa and a rebel network formed by revolutionary Luthen Rael, who received funding and aid from Mothma. Such early groups and the eventual Alliance came together from a number of unrelated rebel cells, including the crew of the Ghost and the Phoenix Cell. The Atrivis Resistance Group was one of the first cells to join what Mothma began calling \"the Alliance\" before the formal formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\n\nThe Alliance and the cells it united were born from the overall discontent within the Empire of those who wished the Galactic Republic restored. Its efforts were by supportive senators in the Imperial Senate such as Mothma, Organa, and later, his daughter Leia Organa. Its members were citizens of the Empire or defectors from the Imperial Military, such as Jan Dodonna, Ryder Azadi, and Wedge Antilles. Founded and united by Organa and Ahsoka Tano, the early rebels were assisted by surviving Jedi, such as Kanan Jarrus, and his Padawan, Ezra Bridger. Clone Wars veterans, such as Captain Rex also assisted in the initial movement.\n\nAs opposed to waging all-out war, the Alliance waged an insurgency against the Empire, establishing small bases across the galaxy instead of controlling an entire planet. When the Alliance stole the plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, and destroyed the space station in the Battle of Yavin with the help of Luke Skywalker, the tide of the war began to turn, and the Rebel threat began to prove a severe thorn in the Empire's side. The Rebellion continued to engage in battles with the Empire in the Galactic Civil War. However, under the command of Darth Vader, the Imperial forces succeeded in defeating the Alliance on Hoth, forcing the Alliance to scatter its forces in order to survive.\n\nEventually, the Alliance prevailed against the Empire and critically damaged it by launching an attack against the second Death Star during its construction in what would become the Battle of Endor. Not only did the Alliance manage to destroy the battle station, but the Imperial Navy was severely crippled by the loss of one of its Super Star Destroyers, and Luke Skywalker redeemed his father, Darth Vader, who killed Emperor Sheev Palpatine, before dying himself in the battle.\n\nThe Alliance was soon reorganized into the fledgling New Republic, restoring the Old Republic and continued the rebellion against the shattered Empire, lasting until the Battle of Jakku one year after Endor, forcing the Galactic Empire to end the war and finally overthrowing it by the signing of the Galactic Concordance.\n\n",

        "content": "# Alliance to Restore the Republic - Official formation[]\n\nThe Rebel Alliance formally came into existence after Mothma resigned from the Imperial Senate and denounced Emperor Palpatine for his role in the Ghorman Massacre. With the help of Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla and her Spectres, Mothma escaped Thrawn's forces by traveling through the dangerous Archeon pass to reach Dantooine. There, Mon Mothma gave a HoloNet speech calling for the galaxy to rise up in rebellion against the Empire. Mothma's message was heard by the rebel cells throughout the galaxy including Lothal and Atollon. The Rebel Fleet converged above Dantooine, and the cells were unified into the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which officially began the Galactic Civil War.\n\nAs part of the Attack on Lothal, Syndulla dispatched the droids AP-5 and Chopper along with the former Imperial cadet Wedge Antilles to steal clearance codes from the Imperial Security Bureau station on the moon Killun 71. During the course of the mission, Chopper was hijacked by a group of Imperial slicers and intelligence officers led by LT-319, who were based aboard an IGV-55 surveillance vessel. LT-319 tried to use Chopper to kill the Spectres and find the location of Chopper Base. However, Syndulla managed to reprogram Chopper and transmitted a data surge that destroyed the Imperial surveillance vessel.\n\nHaving obtained the clearance codes, the Phoenix Squadron began training for their Attack on Lothal. Ezra Bridger was briefly distracted when he departed with Chopper on an errant mission to Tatooine to save Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi from his arch-nemesis the renegade Sith Lord Maul. Kenobi told Bridger to return to his place with the Rebellion and defeated Maul in combat. At some stage of its existence, the Rebel Alliance undertook an assault on Vivonah and the slaughter on Noult, which were decried as terrorist actions by rebel enemies. The rebellion maintained forces on the planet Gaulus until effecting a withdrawal.\n\n",

        "content": "# Alliance to Restore the Republic - Triumph at Endor[]\n\nIn 4 ABY, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was determined to deal a fatal blow to Emperor Palpatine's tyranny. The Alliance Fleet rendezvoused near Sullust to plan an attack. Thanks to its Bothan spies and learned Palpatine was overseeing the final construction stages of the new battle station.\n\nIt was decided that a rebel strike team led by Skywalker, Organa, Solo, and Chewbacca would land on Endor in a stolen Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, with the mission to deactivate the Death Star's energy defense shield. Little did they know that they fell into a trap. When they reached the shield's bunker, the Imperial Army was waiting for them. In orbit of Endor, the Alliance Fleet was ambushed by a large Imperial armada led by the Super Star Destroyer Executor that emerged from hyperspace. Unable to attack the Death Star II until its shield was destroyed, the Rebel Fleet focused its attack on the Star Destroyers. Although its starfighters were able to maneuver easily around the Death Star II, they were still vulnerable to the battle station's superlaser, which destroyed the Liberty and the Nautilian.\n\nOn Endor, the rebel strike team ended up allying with the native Ewoks, who used their knowledge of their homeworld's forests to take the Imperial army by surprise. The strike team was finally able to destroy the shield generator after a lengthy ground battle, allowing its starfleet to attack the Empire's dreaded superweapon. General Calrissian flew the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star with Antilles, Norra Wexley, Keir Santage, Jake Farrell, and another A-wing pilot. They flew through the shafts and were pursued by several TIEs, which gunned down Keir's X-wing starfighter. Calrissian then ordered the group to split up, and Farrell, Wexley and the other A-wing pilot flew down another shaft to lure TIEs back out. Calrissian and Antilles then made it to the reactor core and destroyed the battle station's power plant before retreating back out as the Death Star began to detonate. During an attack on the Executor, Green Leader Commander Arvel Crynyd's A-wing was crippled and crashed into the bridge, killing Admiral Firmus Piett and his staff. Having already taken considerable damage from the Alliance's starfighters, the Executor failed and drifted into the Death Star's gravity well, detonating on impact.\n\nMeanwhile, aboard the station, a blow of an entirely different kind was struck against the Empire. A captive Luke Skywalker, now a JediKnight in his own right, appealed to Vader's paternal love, convincing him to turn on his Master. Vader\u2014once again Anakin Skywalker\u2014seized the Imperial Head of State and hurled him down a shaft to his death, but at the cost of his own life. The Death Star II soon exploded from the damages to its core. With the loss of Emperor Palpatine and his apprentice, the destruction of the Death Star II, and significant losses inflicted on the Imperial Fleet, the Imperials were forced to withdraw. The Empire suffered a decisive defeat, leaving the Rebels to celebrate in victory.\n\n",

Vader's rival Commander Karbin discovered his location and leaked it to Vader's helper, Doctor Aphra who sent Vader to the location, Vrogas Vas. He instantly ran into three X-wing squadrons, Red Squadron, Blue Squadron, and Yellow Squadron of which he began obliterating, before Luke crashed his X-wing into Vader's TIE Advanced and they both crashed onto the surface.

Leia sent the Y-wings of Amber Wing to bomb the area, but they were soon stopped by Commander Karbin and his forces and Karbin tried to take Luke.

Death Squadron, Darth Vader's personal armada, headed for Hoth with a contingent of ground troops, ready to crush the rebellion once and for all. However, due to a mistake by Admiral Kendal Ozzel, the Alliance forces were warned of the Empire's arrival. The Rebels had time to activate the deflector shield protecting Echo Base, rendering orbital bombardment impossible. As the Alliance prepared for evacuation, Imperial troops disembarked on the surface of Hoth, beyond the range of the energy shields. Once there, several legions of snowtroopers advanced on Echo Base. A squadron of All Terrain Armored Transports under the command of General Maximilian Veers was tasked with destroying the massive generators powering the Rebel base's shield. Perimeter Outpost Delta fell first with Sergeant Hazram Namir, Roja, and Beak being forced to retreat back to the main base to find Captain Micha Evon and Everi Chalis.\n\nLuke, who was promoted to Commander by Mothma, led Rogue Squadron of snowspeeders against General Veers' armored transports. By using a harpoon gun and tow-cable, the Rebels managed to bring down one of the transports, but Skywalker's snowspeeder was shot down. Unlike his gunner, Dak Ralter, the Rogue commander survived the accident. With the help of his lightsaber and a grenade, he still managed to destroy another walker. Despite the Rebels' best efforts to delay Veers' armored transports, the Imperial general successfully blew up the protective shield generator, allowing Darth Vader and his men to enter Echo Base. While the Rebel command personnel and material was loaded into transports and whisked away just in time, the unprepared Alliance soldiers engaged the Imperials in conventional warfare. Namir and his two men got back to the main base to find Chalis with and Captain Evon, who was unconscious. They then encountered Darth Vader who killed Captain Evon, Roja, and Beak. Namir and Chalis escaped on a shuttle with Chalis' clearance codes.\n\nUnable to reach a transport, Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the droid C-3PO took their flight in the Millennium Falcon. The Alliance delayed the Imperial troops long enough to get its most important staff off the planet, and its ground-based ion cannon temporarily disabled all ships of Death Squadron, preventing them from attacking the escaping transports. All in all, the Empire still won a major victory on Hoth, as the Alliance was routed from its base once again and barely escaped Death Squadron's blockade. The Imperial victory left the Alliance scattered and General Philap Bygar was killed during or after the battle when running from the Imperials.\n\n",

After an award ceremony during which Princess Leia presented the heroes of the day with medals of Bravery, General Dodonna made it his priority to have Yavin 4 evacuated. Now that the Empire knew their location, they had to find a new base of operations as soon as possible.

The Rebellion also spread footage of their victory over the Death Star via the DarkNet, and the destruction of the battle station was a boon to the rebellion's efforts: with such a major victory secured, the battle proved that victory over the Empire was actually possible. Shortly after Yavin, the Empire targeted and destroyed the Alliance's fuel refinery within the Choah Belt, only for the rebels to respond by capturing the Imperial fuel tanker Black Ice.

Such attacks included a bombing of the Imdaar supply base, the bombing of the Kuat shipyards, and the Assault on Cymoon, which was home to a major Imperial weapons factory known as Weapons Factory Alpha. Luke, Princess Leia, R2-D2, and Han went undercover to the factory, while Chewbacca served as a sniper and C-3PO stayed on the Falcon as their escape pilot. Despite a run-in with Darth Vader, the Rebels were able to destroy the factory, striking another major blow against the Empire.\n\nAlthough the Empire's official explanation was that the destruction of the Death Star and Weapons Factory Alpha were lies spread by rebel propaganda, rumors spread of the rebel victories. However, during the brief encounter with Vader, he saw Luke's lightsaber. He recognized it as his old saber and began his hunt to find the origins of Luke.\n\n",

At the time, the Alliance was headquartered on the lush moon of Yavin 4, in an ancient stone structure known as the Great Temple.\n\nLeia, the surrogate daughter of Organa and crown Princess of Alderaan, succeeded her adopted father in the Imperial Senate and was also a secret member of the Alliance. Prominent Alliance war leaders of the time included General Dodonna and Admiral Gial Ackbar. Some of the Empire's Joint Chiefs, like General Cassio Tagge, realized the full threat of what they called \"the Rebellion.\" Others, like Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, believed in the infallibility of the Empire's might. The Imperials, in an attempt to avoid dissent and sympathy for the Rebellion amongst loyal Imperial citizens, ensured that, through the use of propaganda, they did not know how large of a threat the Alliance truly was, assuring them that it was merely an unorganized and vengeful terrorist organization.\n\n",

After Rebel Command learned of the existence of a second Death Star from Skywalker, the Bothan Spynet began to dig for more information. Emperor Palpatine found out about this and sought to set a trap for the Alliance. He let more information be fed more to the Bothans, with many of them dying in order to get it, and hid the fact that the Death Star II was operational. The new information revealed the location of the Death Star II, Endor, the shield protecting it and the shafts within it big enough for starfighters to pass through to the core.\n\nWhen Alliance High Command got this information, they launched Operation Yellow Moon in order to distract Imperial forces across the galaxy. This was led by Princess Organa and her strike team. Meanwhile, the rebels on the MC80 Star Cruiser Invincible Faith had intercepted a message from Moff Derrek Raythe, which would reveal Emperor Palpatine's trap if they decrypted it in time, but they also captured Commander Iden Versio of the Empire's Inferno Squad, who let it happen so she could get rid of the message.

The shock troopers were later assigned peacekeeping roles after the formation of the New Republic.\n\nThe symbol of the Alliance to Restore the Republic was used in the insignia of the New Republic and later became the emblem of the Resistance, a military force founded by Rebel veteran Leia and made up of several Alliance officers, such as Ackbar and Caluan Ematt, to combat the First Order, the successor of the Empire. During the Bail Organa statue-dedication ceremony in 28 ABY, speeches were delivered by Senators Tai-Lin Garr and Organa that reminded the gathered audience of the sacrifices made by the Rebel Alliance, which were further reinforced by an air show performed by Republic X-wings.\n\nThe Archivist recorded in her holocron her belief that empires required enemies, to give their soldiers targets and a reason to enforce fear. Remarking that Palpatine was very cunning in cultivating enemies in his time as both Supreme Chancellor and Emperor, she suggested that he created the Rebellion to maintain the cycle of violence. When her holocron was later discovered by Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, they remarked that though the Archivist was incorrect regarding Palpatine being the Alliance's founder, he certainly did use it to his advantage.\n\n",

The newly formed ecumenopolis became divided into levels; the Upper City became home to the wealthy and the nobility, the Lower City, began to fall into disrepair and decay; and the Undercity, where those who were banished for committing crimes against the government attempted to dredge out a meager existence. When new hyperspace routes were discovered that marginalized Taris's importance as a trading hub, the planet lost much of its income. The civil war that followed pitted the oppressed underclasses, as well as the many non-Human species that called the world their home, against the rich and the corrupt planetary government. The conflict proved devastating, killing millions and leaving great swaths of the planet in shambles or simply abandoned. Many more people were banished to the Undercity, while the aliens of Taris were relegated to the Lower City, where they often fell prey to swoop gangs or other criminals.\n\n",

Despite a lack of colonies, Besalisks often traveled off Ojom and found occupations which suited their thirst for adventure, though often proving to be unreliable in the sense they tended to wander and never return to the job.\n\nA notable member of the Besalisk species was Dexter Jettster, a gruff, honest being with a remarkable knowledge of weaponry, who owned a diner in Coruscant's CoCo Town district. Formerly a prospector on Kessel, Jettster was a reliable asset to Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and a friend to both Kenobi and the rest of the Jedi Order.\n\nWhile not prevalent, the Force manifested itself in some members of the species; Pong Krell went on to obtain the rank of Master within the Jedi Order during the final days of the Republic. Fighting in the Clone Wars, Master Krell became disenchanted with the Order and the Republic and sought to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems as a Dark Acolyte under the apprenticeship of Dooku after envisioning their victory at the end of the conflict. Before he could follow through with his plan to defect, the clone trooper of the 501st Legion, Dogma executed him for treason against the Republic.\n\n",

Part of a binary star system, the planet orbited two scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had little surface vegetation. It was the homeworld to the native Jawa and Tusken Raider species and of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history.\n\nIt saw a population explosion following the search for valuable mining deposits on the planet's silicate surface. Finding the ore to have undesirable metallurgical properties, mining firms left the planet en masse, leaving behind valuable equipment, most notably large sandcrawlers, which were later used by the Jawa population. The planet then became a haven for smugglers and criminal activity, and fell under the influence of the Hutt Clan while scattered, isolated settlements of hard-working inhabitants endured.\n\nGenerally ignored by the galaxy at large, Tatooine gained the notice of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War when an escape pod carrying two droids in possession of top-secret information landed on the sandy Outer Rim world. The Empire went on to establish a heavier presence on the planet, forging a tenuous relationship with Jabba Desilijic Tiure of the Hutt Clan. Open conflict soon broke out between the Empire and a Rebel Alliance cell on Tatooine that culminated in a battle that left the Empire's hold on the world significantly weakened.\n\nFollowing the death of Jabba and the withdrawal of Imperial forces after the Battle of Endor, an enormous power vacuum occurred on the world, with numerous crime syndicates like the Red Key Raiders attempting to build legitimacy as mining companies. Eventually, former bounty hunter Boba Fett returned and took over Jabba's former territory. Coming into conflict with both the Hutt Clan and the Pyke Syndicate, the new Daimyo was pulled into a gang war that threatened the future of Tatooine. With help from the Mandalorian Din Djarin, Fett rallied the denizens of the settlements Mos Espa and Freetown to push back against the invaders, ushering in a new era of respect between the people of the planet.\n\n",

Located at the intersection of numerous major hyperlanes, including the Perlemian Trade Route, the Corellian Run, the Metellos Trade Route, the Koros Trunk Line, and the Leisure Corridor, its hyperspace coordinates were (0,0,0) which effectively made it the center of the galaxy. These coordinates also inspired the planet's military designation, \"triple zero\" or \"Zero Zero Zero,\" though the actual galactic center was located in the Deep Core. As the de jure center of the galaxy, however, Coruscant was generally agreed to be the most important planet throughout most of galactic history, as well as being one of the wealthiest due to its advantageous location.\n\nCoruscant served as the capital for the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, Yuuzhan Vong Empire, Galactic Alliance, the Fel Empire, Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, and the Galactic Federation Triumvirate. It also served at various times as the home of the Jedi Order and the Jedi Temple.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - The Republic's early years[]\n\nAlmost two centuries after the Lokani Dawn's launch, the people of Coruscant were dismayed to witness the vessel's destruction when the sleeper ship\u2014which had been carefully watched by Coruscanti scientists for the last two centuries\u2014was ripped apart by a meteor shower. The development of hyperspace cannons linked Coruscant to Alderaan, Duro, Corellia, and other worlds, but it was not until Corellian scientists succeeded in reverse-engineering the Rakatan hyperdrive around 25,000 BBY that starships could travel between the worlds of the Republic in a matter of days. Coruscant soon became the anchor for the newly charted Perlemian Trade Route, a major hyperlane that linked the Republic with the distant Tion Cluster\u2014where the Human colonists had developed their own proud and warlike society. Coruscant also sat at the intersection of the Perlemian and the Spin, a hyperlane that wrapped around the Deep Core from Metellos to Corellia.\n\nAround 25,000 BBY, the Perlemian Trade Route brought the Republic into contact with the Jedi Order on the distant planet Ossus, and after Jedi Master Haune Tiar toured the Republic, the Jedi became the government's protectors and established a presence on Coruscant. However, when the First Great Schism split the Jedi Order around 24,500 BBY, Coruscant was caught up in the conflict between the Jedi Order and the Dark Jedi of the Legions of Lettow, as a battle occurred on Coruscant during the fighting. Around 24,000 BBY, the Tionese War broke out with the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion as the Tionese began a march of conquest along the Perlemian Trade Route. Between 24,000 and 23,900 BBY, the Tionese pushed deep into the Core Worlds, and even Coruscant itself was attacked\u2014the Tionese bombarded Coruscant's city-surface with pressure bombs. As the centuries passed, Republic City\u2014a district in Coruscant's eastern hemisphere near the Manarai Mountains\u2014expanded outward, absorbing the planet's other districts and developing into the ecumenopolis of Galactic City.\n\nAs Coruscant grew more prosperous, the Core World of Alsakan began to grow jealous of the planet's place at the heart of the Republic. Alsakan was a major influence in the Human-dominated sectors along the Perlemian Trade Route, primarily the region known as the Northern Dependencies, while Coruscant was a powerful player in the Arrowhead and the Slice\u2014the sections of the Core Worlds, the Colonies, the Inner Rim, and the Expansion Region that lay between the Perlemian to the north and the Spin to the south. The Spin was the original lifeline of the Republic, and because the Perlemian only intersected with the Spin at Coruscant, Alsakan and its dependents were largely independent from the rest of the Republic. The aristocratic Alsakani, who called the Perlemian the Axis, sought to supplant Coruscant as the seat of Republic power, and in 17,018 BBY, Alsakan led the Axis worlds in claiming a number of resource-rich systems to block the Grand Companies, the major trading conglomerates of the Spin. Coruscant and the Republic backed the Spin merchants, sending a fleet to the planet Virujansi and capturing it. Thus began the First Alsakan Conflict, a series of seventeen wars between the Coruscant-dominated Republic and Alsakan that spanned fourteen thousand years. The First Conflict was ended by the Bureau of Ships and Services in 16,700 BBY, though both Coruscant and Alsakan would be raided during the early conflicts, neither side ever achieved true victory over the other, and Corellia developed into a third galactic player as it excused itself from the conflicts.\n\nIn 15,500 BBY, Republic scouts encountered the enormous, fire-breathing reptilian species known as the Duinuogwuin on a planet in the Outer Rim Territories. Terrified, the scouts opened fire on the Duinuogwuin and fled the planet, returning to Coruscant, but the enraged Duinuogwuin followed their attackers back to the capital and attacked it in what would be later known as the Duinuogwuin Contention. The Supreme Chancellor at the time, Fillorean, refused to mobilize the Republic Navy and instead attempted to communicate with the massive Star Dragons attacking the planet\u2014and to the surprise of the terrified Coruscanti, Fillorean was successful. The Duinuogwuin were actually intelligent and naturally peaceful, and the Duinuogwuin philosopher Borz'Mat'oh negotiated a treaty to end the conflict. The two later worked together to establish the University of Coruscant, the planet's first university, and the two were immortalized in a pair of statues fashioned from chalcedony.\n\n",

The Sith had managed to reach the steps of the Senate building before the Sith meditation sphere coordinating and exaggerating their forces was damaged, allowing the Republic and Jedi to counterattack. The land given to the Jedi, surrounding a Force nexus centered on a mountain, had been a place of worship for the Coruscanti for centuries. Many senators expected the Jedi to construct a fortress to defend the planet in the event of a future invasion, but while the Jedi Council eagerly accepted the land, it held to the belief that the Jedi were not by nature a military force. Instead, the Council authorized the construction of meditative centers and training centers, some of which helped preserve Coruscant's disappearing natural environment. Following the devastation of Ossus, the Jedi Council took up residence in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, to which many Jedi relics from Ossus were taken. The Temple was greatly expanded, including the building of the original Jedi Council Chamber.\n\nThe Great Galactic War broke out between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire in 3681 BBY and lasted until 3653 BBY. Towards the end of the war, the Sith surprised the galaxy and extended an offer of peace to the Republic. Although cautious of the Empire's intentions, the Republic's Galactic Senate accepted.\n\nWhile Republic and Imperial delegations convened on Alderaan for treaty negotiations, Sith Lord Darth Angral led a Sith battle fleet to Coruscant and initiated the Sacking of Coruscant. Their first contact was made with the Coruscant Security Force's Orbital Security Station Six which the Sith quickly obliterated. They then began their invasion of the planet. Sending a stolen Republic shuttle to the Jedi Temple, the Sith broke through and engaged the Jedi who were present as well as the Temple Security Force. However, the Jedi were overwhelmed and Coruscant's defenses were brought down, allowing the Sith to land their troops. The Sith took the Senate Building and the Supreme Chancellor was assassinated. Six members of the Jedi Council were also killed in the battle, while the Jedi Temple itself was destroyed.\n\nWith Coruscant securely in their grip, the Empire was able to take command of the negotiations on Alderaan, forcing the Republic delegation to sign the controversial Treaty of Coruscant. Although it brought an end to the Great Galactic War, the treaty set the stage for the Cold War, which would last a scarce decade before open conflict resumed. Even then, scars left by the Sith Empire were still visible on the planet, both on its inhabitants and on the buildings.\n\nAt some point before 3600 BBY, the war with the Sith ceased, and the Jedi returned to Coruscant, erecting a new Temple in place of the old. This new Temple was repeatedly expanded, including in 3519 BBY and 2519 BBY when the Jedi Archives were built, and 1019 BBY when the Temple spires were finally fully rebuilt. The seventeenth and final Alsakan Conflict also occurred after the conclusion of the Sith wars, and in 3017 BBY, Corellian privateers inflicted a dramatic defeat on a Republic squadron at Coruscant. The Republic declared war on Corellia in response, but its forces were quickly outfought, and the conflict ended when Corellian Prince-Admiral Jonash e Solo dictated a peace treaty on the floor of the Senate Building.\n\nThe New Sith Wars brought turmoil again to the Republic. Beginning in 2000 BBY with the Fourth Great Schism and ending in 1000 BBY, the New Sith Wars contained 1,000 years of fighting between the Republic and the Sith. The Republic Dark Age that began in 1100 BBY was seen by most as a period where the Republic ceased to exist as its territory became a rump around Coruscant and the some of the Core Worlds. The Jedi took direct control of the Republic, bypassing the Senate entirely. The Sith were poised to take Coruscant itself only to be stopped at Ruusan. With the Sith armies thought to be completely destroyed, the Republic was rebuilt under the Ruusan Reformation. A new age began for the Republic, a time of peace lasting for several centuries.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Surface[]\n\nGeologically, the planet was composed of a molten core with a rocky mantle and a silicate rock crust. At its poles were huge ice caps that were popular spots for tourists. The entire surface of Coruscant was covered by sprawling kilometers-high ecumenopolis, and boasted a population of over a hundred billion to several trillion, depending on the era. Following the end of the Clone Wars, an official census noted 1 trillion official permanent residents. The statistics did not include transients, temporary workers, unregistered populace, nor residents of orbital facilities. Because of these omissions, the actual population of Coruscant was estimated to be three times the official record.\n\nCoruscant was known to have the tallest buildings in the Galaxy. Coruscanti skyscrapers dwarfed all the original natural features, including mountains, as well as floors of oceans which once covered a large portion of Coruscant's surface. Areas of Galactic City were broken up into 5,127 levels which were then divided into megablocks, blocks, and subblocks. Coruscant itself was divided into quadrants, which were divided into zones. Below the skyscrapers was Coruscant's undercity, where sunlight never reached. Artificial lighting illuminated these lower levels and advertisement holograms could be seen everywhere. There were numerous establishments for entertainment, catering to a myriad of alien species. The residents were collectively referred to as Twilighters.\n\nCoruscant was once a world mostly covered in oceans. However, all natural bodies of water were drained and stored in vast caverns beneath the city as a result of years of overpopulation. The only body of water visible was the artificial Western Sea, with many artificial islands floating on it, used by tourists on holidays.\n\nWith no other bodies of water available to feed and water its trillion inhabitants, Coruscant's architects, along with many others from around the galaxy, worked together to build a self-contained eco-system in the massive buildings set all over the planet. Polar cap stations also melted ice and distributed water throughout the planet-wide city through a complex series of pipes.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - The Pius Dea and onward[]\n\nAround 12,000 BBY, the Galactic Museum was established on Coruscant, and it would serve as the galaxy's premier repository of historical artifacts for well over ten thousand years. By that time, a religious cult known as Pius Dea that worshiped a deity named The Goddess had been established on Coruscant for several centuries, and the cult's followers were known for their strict moral code and their emphasis on both spiritual purity and humanocentrism. Around 12,000 BBY, the Human later known as Contispex I rose to prominence within the Coruscant Merchants' Guild, and he became a leadership figure in the Pius Dea faith on Coruscant. Pius Dea arranged for the impeachment of Bothan Supreme Chancellor Pers'lya in 11,987 BBY, and his assassination shortly afterward, and Contispex I was elected to succeed Pers'lya as a result.\n\nUnder Contispex, the Pius Dea became the unofficial religion of the Republic, and he taught that communities could be restored to purity by purging \"irredeemable\" elements\u2014and to the Pius Dea, alien species were the epitome of spiritual corruption. In 11,965 BBY, Contispex I launched the First Pius Dea Crusade, one of thirty-four military campaigns against alien species that would be conducted by Contispex and his successors, who formed the Contispex dynasty and took on the title of Contispex to honor the first Contispex. In 11,933 BBY, the Jedi Order departed Coruscant and returned to Ossus in the Recusal, as they could not decide what action to take against the corrupt Republic. The Pius Dea Era finally ended in 10,966 BBY, when the Jedi Order, Alsakan, and a number of alien species defeated the Pius Dea at the Battle of Uquine in the Seventh Alsakan Conflict.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Pre-Republic[]\n\nAround 200,000 BBY, the planet Notron was home to two species: the grey-skinned Taung and the Zhell, the ancestors of the modern Humans. The Thirteen Nations of Zhell eventually came into conflict with the Taung, and the Battalions of Zhell fought the Taung in a fierce war. However, during a battle at the city of Great Zhell, a volcano erupted, and the Taung overran the terrified Zhell in the battle that followed. Taking the victory and the cloud of volcanic ash as a sign of divine favor, the Taung adopted the name Dha Werda Verda\u2014the Warriors of Shadow. However, they were ultimately driven off of Notron to the planet Roon by the Zhell. The leaders of the Thirteen Nations were believed by archaeologists to have been buried near the planet's south pole, in the structure that became known as the Ice Crypts. The Mother Goddess Onrai was believed to be the Mistress of the planet Notron.\n\nSometime around 100,000 BBY, the Columi species visited Notron\u2014known by that time as Coruscant\u2014though they dismissed the world as primitive and a disappointment. Coruscant's Human natives began to urbanize their homeworld after the departure of the Taung, and archaeologists later believed that the Petrax Historic Quarter was the site of the planet's first skyscrapers. The Gree species also had contact with early Humans, building Coruscant's original infrastructure, and by the approximate date of 90,000 BBY, the ecumenopolis later known as Galactic City had begun to build upwards. As the Human population soared, they were forced to develop the first atmospheric scrubbers, delivery pipelines, recycling plants, and hydroponic farms, and instead of burying unrecyclable garbage, Coruscant's inhabitants built cannons that launched canisters of waste into orbit where garbage scows could tow them out of the star system.\n\nAround 30,000 BBY, the Rakata species discovered Coruscant and incorporated it into their Infinite Empire. Some Humans were taken as slaves and put to work across the Empire, though the remaining Humans learned from their rulers' technology and developed sleeper ships. Over the next several centuries, the Coruscanti dispatched a number of sleeper ships, and by 27,500 BBY, their ships had established colonies on Metellos, Alsakan, Axum, Tepasi, Alderaan, Kuat, Rendili, Corfai, Corellia, and the worlds of the Ringali Shell region. Around 27,000 BBY, they launched ships even further, seeding the planets Barseg and Janilis VII in the distant Tion Cluster.\n\nAround 25,200 BBY, the Infinite Empire collapsed due to infighting and a species-wide plague that afflicted the Rakata, and the Humans of Coruscant reclaimed rulership of their world. Around that time, they launched the sleeper ship Lokani Dawn. By 25,053 BBY, Coruscant had established contact with Alderaan, Duro, Corellia, and many other planets in the Core Worlds, and the planet was the site of the signing of the Galactic Constitution, which founded the Galactic Republic and named Coruscant the capital of the new government.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Environment[]\n\nA series of orbital mirrors were set up that reflected the sun's warmth and light. Several of these mirrors were destroyed during the Clone Wars, specifically the Battle of Coruscant. It is known that thunderstorms and rain occurred during 19 BBY and 3 ABY.\n\nThe planet produced trillions of tons of waste every hour. Though almost everything on the planet, from clothes to packaging and machinery was recyclable, some waste was too dangerous to recycle. Such items included worn-out hyperdrive cores which were delivered to one of the planet's five thousand garbage pits, where they were put into canisters and fired into a tight orbit around the planet. Garbage ships then collected them and transported them to nearby moons for storage. Some of the more dangerous materials were shot into the nearby sun for complete incineration. Garbage not exported or destroyed was mixed into a slurry of silicone oils and processed by garbage worms which chewed it into pellets while removing any remaining organics, plastic, or recoverable metals. They turned millions of tons of pellets into carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases.\n\nCoruscant's enormous population and industrialization also produced massive amounts of carbon dioxide and heat energy. Thousands of carbon dioxide-reactive atmospheric dampeners were put into place in the upper atmosphere to prevent atmospheric degeneration. The first set of these planet-wide dampeners, developed by the Galactic Republic, was known as the Coruscant Atmospheric Reclamation Project.\n\nNear the planet's core were a number of massive power relay stations. The lowest levels were abandoned to mutants and scavengers, such as the cannibalistic, mythical Cthon. The foundations of many of the transparisteel and smoked duracrete buildings, some of which weighed billions of tons, also extended deep into the planet's crust.\n\nGalactic Standard Time was developed on Coruscant and so was tied to the daily and yearly cycle of the planet. A standard day, like Coruscant, was made up of 24 hours, while a standard year's 368 days reflected the length of Coruscant's year.\n\n",

It was the ancient homeworld of the Taung and Zhell species, and it was generally also believed to be the original birthplace of Humans. During most of galactic history, Coruscant was the most politically important world in the galaxy. At various times, it was the capital of the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire, the New Republic, the Yuuzhan Vong empire, the Galactic Alliance, Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, and the Galactic Federation Triumvirate. In controlling Coruscant, these governments controlled most of the galaxy in the process.\n\nOver the centuries, Coruscant had developed into an ecumenopolis, with a total of 5,127 levels of city built up from the crust by the time of the Clone Wars. The actual planet-wide metropolis of Coruscant was called Galactic City. Under the Galactic Republic, the names Republic City or the City of Spires were also used to reference the city. It was also called Imperial City under the Galactic Empire, and New Republic City under the New Republic. However, in practice, Galactic City and its other names were sometimes applied to the Senate District, the central government center and de facto capital of Coruscant.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Neighborhoods[]\n\nGalactic City was divided into quadrants, several thousand in number, with each quadrant further split into sectors. Each sector was numbered on official maps, but sectors often had nicknames, such as Sah'c Town, also known as sector H-46, named for a prominent family that owned a large portion of its land, or The Works, the largest of Coruscant's designated industrial zones.\n\nThe Works was once one of the galaxy's major manufacturing areas, where starship parts, droids, and building materials were heavily produced for centuries, but as construction and industry became more efficient and cheaper off-world, The Works fell into disrepair. The area gained a reputation as a hub of criminal activity and locals generally stayed away from it.\n\nA similar, but more dangerous area, was the Factory District, which was once the industrial heart of Coruscant until it too lost out to competition from producers in other Core Worlds. By the time of the Great Jedi Purge, it lay in ruins and was almost completely deserted of sentients, because of the feral droids that prowled its streets. It was located on the opposite side of the planet, and was much more dangerous than the Southern Underground, Invisible Sector, which were infamous in their own right.\n\nAnother area of Coruscant was CoCo Town, an abbreviation of \"collective commerce.\" Many diverse species lived there and worked in manufacturing. A partially enclosed open-air plaza near the Senate building, the Column Commons, was so-called because it housed most of the HoloNet and news media corporations.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Economic and political rivalries[]\n\nCoruscant was not unique as a galactic hub in the galaxy after hyperdrive became common usage. 53 years after the formation of the Republic, the term \"Whoever controls Coruscant controls the galaxy\" was coined. During the Old Republic era and beyond, there were several urbanized planets and moons that rivaled Coruscant economically, and some that were other major governmental centers.\n\nAlsakan: From 17,000 BBY to 3017 BBY, the Core World Alsakan attempted to usurp Coruscant's pre-eminence as the Galactic capital seventeen times in the Alsakan Conflicts. Initially driven by differences over colonization policy, with Coruscant favoring a centralized, bureaucratic state and Alsakan preferring greater local independence and initiative, the Alsakan Conflicts were fought over 14,000 years. The differences between the two planets survived the Pius Dea Era, the Old Sith Wars, and the Great Galactic War, before the Seventeenth Alsakan Conflict was finally, decisively ended by the Corellian Hegemony. Despite the conflicts ending Alsakan continued to rival Coruscant economically, and culturally for the rest of known galactic history, using high galactic as a cultural alternative to basic script.\nNar Shaddaa: In 15,000 BBY, the Hutts, having abandoned their homeworld of Varl, took control of the moon, which was located on popular trade routes, particularly the Ootmian Pabol, and Nar Shaddaa became completely urbanized. Eventually, trade routes shifted, and the moon lost its economic opportunities. Nar Shaddaa became a haven for smugglers and criminals. Nicknamed \"Little Coruscant\" as the moon was heavily populated with layer on layers, it had little of the grace of Coruscant's skyline.\nEmpress Teta: In 5,000 BBY, the planet, then known as Koros Major, rose to the forefront of galactic events as the Old Sith Empire attacked it. The Jedi repelled the invaders, and since then it was considered the capital of the Deep Core, even being called the \"Coruscant of the Deep Core.\" A bastion of civilization in the impenetrable and treacherous Deep Core, it remained a major center of commerce during the times of the Empire, New Republic and Galactic Alliance. It was also intended as the original redoubt for the New Republic government to flee to during the Yuuzhan Vong War, but eventually, Mon Calamari became favored over the ancient planet.\nTaris: The planet was situated on the Perlemian Trade Route and became a major economic center in ages past. However, several new, shorter trade routes were discovered, rendering Taris obsolete. Without the support of the Republic, the planet fell into ruin and disrepair. Taris's surface was devastated by Darth Malak in 3956 BBY, during the Jedi Civil War.\nEriadu: Located on the Hydian Way, this prosperous and highly polluted world served as the capital of the Outer Rim in the waning days of the Old Republic, the time of the Empire, and during the rise of the New Republic. However, it lost its glory after the Yuuzhan Vong War.\nDenon: Throughout the waning days of the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire and the New Republic, Denon continued to thrive in the Inner Rim. After the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War, while the Galactic Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong were rebuilding Coruscant, Denon was chosen to serve as the temporary capital of the Alliance in 29 ABY. By 30 ABY, the galactic capital had returned to Coruscant.\nMuunilinst: This economic powerhouse had backed the galactic currencies since the inception of the Galactic Credit Standard and remained at the center of the galactic economy. Although not rivaling Coruscant politically, its economic power remained as strong as ever, if not stronger as shown after the Battle of Muunilinst, which led the galaxy to the brink of financial ruin. After this, it became the financial center of the Empire and remained in this position for at least the duration of the New Order. After the Yuuzhan Vong war, Muunilinst, along with Mygeeto, no longer had a tie in with Coruscant, and by 40 ABY, the Imperial Remnant had control of its credit harvest.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Palpatine's rule[]\n\nAs with the Republic, Coruscant continued to function as the galactic capital, but was renamed \"Imperial Center,\" while Galactic City was re-dubbed \"Imperial City.\" While the planet's name was officially changed during Palpatine's rule, most working-class denizens of the Galactic Empire continued to call the planet-city by its old name. As part of the Humanocentric policies of the Empire, non-Human species were also compelled to live in segregated areas of Imperial City, the largest and best-known of which was known as Invisec. Those who did enter other parts, whether by intention or mistake, were punished brutally. Coruscant was also the site of the Imperial Senate until the body's dissolution in 0 BBY. Coruscant was seeded with weapon factories, laboratories, and various other military installations. Shipyards were also stationed above the planet to construct capital ships. As a symbol of Imperial power, Coruscant would act as a staging area within orbit of the planet where massive Imperial fleets would gather, to the point where they blocked the sunlight from reaching the planet.\n\nEmperor Palpatine also began to shape Coruscant with his own designs, and this included the installation of almost one million surveillance systems throughout the ecumenopolis. Massive shield generators were placed all over Coruscant, and where the shield segments overlapped, powerful storms would brew. Although Coruscant had always been known for its high concentration of thunderstorms due to rising vapor from the billions of buildings and homes, the increased frequency lent the planet a foreboding, almost Gothic look. Palpatine also arranged for the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Lusankya to be buried beneath the Manarai Mountains district. Later, the massive battleship was used as a private prison by Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard. Palpatine also had the Palace of the Republic rebuilt and renamed the Imperial Palace. The Palace, a massive pyramidal structure which was by far the largest structure on Coruscant, was rumored to also be the largest building in the entire galaxy, with the possible exceptions of the massive Sharu plastic pyramids of the Rafa system. Upon the completion of the Palace, Palpatine ordered the construction of a smaller castle residence for Lord Darth Vader nearby. Although Vader already possessed a fortress retreat on Coruscant and several other retreats off-world, the castle would function as his main residence.\n\nUnder Imperial rule, illegal trade flourished on Coruscant, where the nobility coveted certain prohibited items, including slaves and banned artwork, as status symbols. Palpatine tolerated such activity, as it kept minor nobles occupied with their own intrigues and provided him with a means of blackmailing some nobles into his service. Around this time, the most prominent spice dealer on the planet was Wendell Wright-Sims, a wealthy socialite who operated with the express permission of the Emperor himself and took great pains to ensure that his product was the finest available. Most members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic considered venturing to Coruscant a foolhardy endeavor; nevertheless, Coruscanti resistance cells did exist, based in the planet's Factory District. Shasheva Astopone, the heiress to an exporting fortune, used her wealth to fund some of the local Rebel cells and smuggled goods to and from Coruscant for the Alliance through her business.\n\nFollowing Palpatine's departure to the Endor system, to oversee the second Death Star, at least two, massive space stations commonly known as worldcrafts were being constructed. The Emperor personally gifted them to his most loyal servants, with Ennix Devian and Grand Moff Ardus Kaine were to be gifted a craft each, however, Devian would steal both of them for his new empire following the failure at Endor.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - The Empire erodes[]\n\nFollowing the death of Palpatine at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, an uprising took place on Coruscant. Billions of Coruscanti reveled in their new-found freedom, and an armed uprising sprang out from the non-human-dominated sectors. Imperial patrols were attacked in the streets, statues of Palpatine were toppled and other Imperial symbols were desecrated. In the midst of the celebrating and rioting, alarmed Imperial authorities ordered a massive crackdown on the rebellious elements in the city-planet's population and gave full power to the local military force to end the uprising and restore order to the system. The military retaliation was ruthless and the death toll rose as the Empire struck down the insurrectionists and brought the populace back under its control.\n\nIn the six months after Palpatine's death, operatives of the New Republic destroyed several Coruscanti HoloNet installations key to communication between the capital and Imperial forces throughout the galaxy. With the cessation of leadership from Coruscant and the absence of a clear successor to Palpatine, many Moffs and admirals in outlying regions became warlords, seizing sectors and fleets for themselves. One such individual was Admiral Gaen Drommel, who departed from Coruscant with the Super Star Destroyer Guardian with the intention of defending his native Oplovis sector.\n\nAmidst these tumultuous events, the Grand Vizier Sate Pestage assumed control of Imperial Center. Unfortunately, he was opposed by Palpatine's former advisors who formed the Inner Circle. Ysanne Isard operated as a neutral intermediary between the two opposing factions. Unbeknownst to them, she had been secretly pitting them against each other, clearing the path for her rise to become Empress in all but name, though neither side realized her true intentions until it was far too late. She eventually assumed control of Imperial Center in 5 ABY though her reign was plagued by the threat of rival warlords and the expanding New Republic. Thus, she had a team of scientists including Evir Derricote create an artificial virus known as the Krytos virus which only affected non-Human species and then contaminated the city planet's water supply with it.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Planetary defense systems[]\n\nAs of the Battle of Coruscant during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Coruscant had a four tier defense system. The first and uppermost tier was a series of mines. These were deactivated during the battle at the behest of Lando Calrissian, because he believed that they would do more harm than good, only to be reactivated by Calrissian later when the attacking Vong fleet was in the midst of the minefield.\n\nThe second tier was a series of Golan Defense Platforms, mostly Golan II types. The command platform was dubbed \"Orbital Defense One\" and was larger than its cousins. Most of these were destroyed when the Vong broke through New Republic lines, including Orbital Defense One.\n\nThe third tier was a massive planetary shield, controlled by a series of hundreds of relays on the surface of Coruscant. The shield seems to have worked by some kind of dispersion of energy released onto the shield. The Vong employed a tactic that involved waves of kamikaze ships crashing into the shield, overloading the relays, and effectively bringing it down.\n\nThe fourth and last tier was an array of rooftop turbolasers, akin to the point-defense systems on some capital ships. Some were operated automatically, others by Human gunners and astromech droids. Also counted was the proton bomb in the Chief of State's office, which was detonated when Vong soldiers occupied the Imperial Palace. The explosion destroyed the building housing the office, and the data towers on Coruscant.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Clone Wars[]\n\nIn 22 BBY, the Clone Wars erupted when the newly created Grand Army of the Republic attacked the Confederate-controlled world of Geonosis. Coruscant experienced a number of radical changes during the galaxy-spanning conflict. Large swaths of the cityscape were laid low to make room for the construction of military staging areas. Millions of citizens were displaced by the urban renewal, most of them impoverished, members of alien species loyal to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, or both. Initially, there was public outcry, but such dissidence was either ignored or quashed. Acts of terrorism were also commonplace, with indiscriminate tactics such as bombings resulting in hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of casualties. Most were the products of Separatist cells, while some isolated incidents were of questionable origin. Assassination attempts on influential Republic politicians were common.\n\nIncidents included the raid of Ziro's palace after the Republic discovered the Hutt's affiliation with Count Dooku; the holding of Senator Meena Tills hostage by Korunnai terrorists which was actually cover for an attempt to turn the Corporate Sector against the Republic; and the Senate hostage crisis at the Republic Executive Building that was carried out by bounty hunter Cad Bane to free Ziro the Hutt. The year 21 BBY saw a wave of such disasters, including the Coruscant Insurrection by Count Dooku and Dark Jedi Trenox to steal a holocron at the Jedi Temple; the bombing of the freighter Star of Iskin that killed former Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum and thousands on the surface as a result of raining debris; a terrorist attack on a power generator that resulted in power outages and fires throughout the Senate District; the assassination of Senator Viento by rogue Jedi Quinlan Vos; and the murders of Senator Onaconda Farr and Senator Mee Deechi by Farr's personal aide Lolo Purs.\n\nAlso, at some point during the Clone Wars, there was an incident involving a Zillo Beast from Malastare. After the creature was transported to Coruscant by order of Chancellor Palpatine, the Zillo Beast was subjected to examination and experimentation. When Palpatine ordered its destruction in order to hasten the procedure, the Zillo Beast broke free and immediately sought vengeance on the man who was intent on killing it. As it rampaged through Galactic City, thousands of citizens tried to flee in terror while the Jedi and their clone forces scrambled to neutralize the creature. Upon reaching the Executive Building, the Zillo Beast nearly succeeded in killing the Chancellor, only for its efforts to be thwarted by the Jedi. Although they succeeded in killing it, Chancellor Palpatine discreetly ordered that the Zillo Beast be cloned to conduct further research.\n\nSuch incidents prompted the Republic to implement numerous changes on Coruscant in the name of increased security. Clone troopers of the Republic's newly formed Grand Army were dispatched throughout the planet on regular patrols as the capital's military guard. The fanatically pro-Human COMPOR was founded; the local SAGroup, led by Nenevanth Tion, marched in a parade of Republic patriotism on Coruscant. COMPOR pressured Tannon Praji into deporting from the capital all members of species whose homeworld had joined the Confederacy.\nFollowing the Star of Iskin incident, the Senate approved the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act, which allowed Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to strip civil liberties in the name of civil security. Coruscant fell under particularly heavy government supervision, with security becoming gradually tighter as one traveled deeper into the levels of the Galactic City.\n\nThe planet's lower levels, which had once been a haven for crime and an unregulated market, became heavily subdued, such that illicit goods and services became difficult to find. While most Coruscanti were content with surrendering these and other liberties for security, the changes did not sit well with the galactic capital's alien population, particularly those that were associated with the leadership of the Confederacy. Many Geonosians, Muuns, Neimoidians, and Gossams suffered ostracization on Coruscant, while many others were forced to flee the world altogether. In addition, numerous rumors surfaced regarding antiwar demonstrations that were quelled with forceful measures, seizure of private property, and disappearances. As disturbing as these abuses of power were, proof of the acts was either nonexistent or easily discredited. Throughout the remainder of the war, the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act was altered by amendments known as the Security Acts, which, although intended to further enhance security throughout the Republic, also contributed to Palpatine's growing power over the government and the weakening of the authority of the Galactic Senate.\n\nDespite the numerous precautions taken, in 19 BBY, on 15:5:20, the Confederacy of Independent Systems succeeded in making a surprise raid on Coruscant. Bypassing the heavily fortified Corellian sector by use of secret hyperspace routes through the Deep Core provided by Darth Sidious, a Separatist fleet under the command of the dreaded General Grievous took the city planet completely unaware. While the Separatist ships engaged the Republic home defense fleet, an army of battle droids descended upon Galactic City. The invasion distracted the defending Jedi and clone forces while General Grievous and a squad of his elite MagnaGuards captured Chancellor Palpatine. However, Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi succeeded in rescuing the Supreme Chancellor from the infamous Separatist flagship Invisible Hand. The Battle of Coruscant eventually turned in the Republic's favor, and the Separatist armada was forced into a full retreat. However, the battle had shaken much of the population, and large portions of the city had been decimated by falling ships or collateral damage caused in the vicious fighting.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine brought about the destruction of the Jedi Order by issuing Order 66 to all clone troopers throughout the galaxy from his executive office. In the Grand Convocation Chamber of the Senate Building, Palpatine announced the creation of his New Order to the Galactic Senate. With the Jedi all but destroyed, Palpatine proclaimed his intentions to reorganize the Republic into the first Galactic Empire, and thus declared himself Emperor. Meanwhile, Alderaanian senator Bail Organa, having witnessed the massacre at the Jedi Temple, transported surviving Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Coruscant, where, at the Temple, the two Jedi dismantled a coded signal urging Jedi to gather there. Yoda later confronted Palpatine at the Senate Building, but failed to kill him.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Separatist Crisis[]\n\nIn 24 BBY, former Jedi Master Count Dooku reemerged on Raxus Prime and delivered an impassioned speech that presented the case for the Republic's irreversible corruption. Thus began the Separatist Crisis, in which thousands of worlds seceded from the Republic and joined Dooku's newly inaugurated Confederacy of Independent Systems. Westport, which handled the bulk of Coruscant's emigrant departures, experienced a 6,000% increase in traffic during the crisis, while Eastport took in masses of refugees from seceded worlds. On 13:3:6, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine announced on the general channels of the HoloNet from the Senate Rotunda that 5:16 would be the date of a full Senate vote on the creation of a centralized military to oppose the Separatist threat. On the morning of 13:3:7, a three-hour brawl between Houk and Weequay immigrants at the Eastport processing station left 15 dead and 45 wounded. On 13:4:4, a garbage launcher misfire destroyed four surrounding blocks of the cityscape and littered the entire Desrini District with dangerous industrial waste, which attracted huge numbers of scavenging dianogas to the area over the following months. Later in 13:4, the Coruscant Ministry of Ingress, in response to port overcrowding and the threat of Separatist terrorism, issued new restrictions on all interstellar traffic inbound to Coruscant.\n\nMeanwhile, the Military Creation Act spawned increasingly vocal advocates and opponents, and on 13:5:9, large-scale riots were narrowly averted when the Senate Guard was dispatched to disperse crowds gathering at the entrances of the Senate Rotunda. On 13:5:16, an assassination attempt on Naboo senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala was made when she arrived on Coruscant to vote against the Military Creation Act. A bomb destroyed her starship shortly after its landing, killing several of her handmaidens and guards. Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were assigned to protect her, and during the following night they foiled another attempt at Padm\u00e9's penthouse by Zam Wesell, leading to an airspeeder chase which ended in a showdown at the Outlander Club, a sports bar and club in an entertainment district in the lower levels of the planet. The Jedi captured Wesell, but she was killed by Jango Fett. Kenobi's subsequent investigation of Wesell's death led him to Kamino, setting off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of the Clone Wars.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Galactic Alliance[]\n\nThe Galactic Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong signed a peace treaty in 29 ABY, thus ending the Yuuzhan Vong War, and not long after, terminated the Yuuzhan Vong Empire and the Peace Brigade. It was decided that Coruscant would be rebuilt as the capital of the Galactic Alliance, returning to the ecumenopolis-style whenever possible while leaving the Yuuzhan Vong terraforming wherever it was as yet unfeasible to change. The World Brain would still remain in the Senate Building, as there was as yet no way to remove it without causing further damage to the planet.\n\nAs the government transferred back to the world from Denon in 30 ABY, buildings such as the Senate Building were remodeled, new buildings were constructed such as the Defense Force headquarters and the New Jedi Temple. With this move, the Galactic Alliance had officially taken authority of the galaxy. A large park called Unity Green was also constructed to symbolize the treaty between the Yuuzhan Vong and the Galactic Alliance.\n\nCoruscant began to appear as bustling and thriving as it once did during the Old Republic with the effects of the Yuuzhan Vong War still a reminder, from the growth on skyscrapers, to the altered night sky. Air traffic in skylanes was still the primary mode of transportation.\n\nAround the time of the Second Galactic Civil War in 40 ABY, the Galactic Alliance Guard (GAG), a secret police organization, was formed by the Galactic Alliance to spy on and monitor Corellian terrorist activity on Coruscant. The Guard was led by Jacen Solo, a Jedi Knight, a Colonel of the Galactic Alliance military, and also an aspiring Sith Lord.\n\nThe GAG were responsible for interning and deporting Corellian citizens in Galactic City, and in some cases, executing those taken during the raids. Thus, because of these harsh actions and their dark military uniforms, members of the Guard earned a fast reputation as a uncompromising band of hard-liners among the population. Members of the Coruscant Security Force gave them the nickname \"Stormies,\" thus drawing inevitable comparisons of Jacen Solo to the late Darth Vader and the troops themselves to stormtroopers.\n\nUnder Solo's leadership the soldiers saw a likeness within Solo with Vader's own command style, noting that he \"never asked of them what he would not do himself.\" Though necessary in some respects, the GAG's actions were mainly a vehicle for Solo's rise to the position of Sith Lord. This would only deepen the rift between the Galactic Alliance and the Corellian-led secessionist movement.\n\nIn the same year, Solo, now the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, was attacked by Kyle Katarn and three other Jedi Knights in front of the Senate building. Katarn was deeply wounded and one of the Knights had lost his life by Caedus's hand, but Katarn and the other Jedi had managed to escape. The outcome came as expected for the Jedi. Unbeknownst to the Sith, Jedi Seha Dorvald planted a tracking device on Caedus's cloak allowing the Jedi hidden on Endor to track Caedus's every move. Following Darth Caedus' death in 41 ABY at the hand of his sister, the Confederation surrendered, ending the war.\n\nTwo years later, the Unification Summit was held on Coruscant to resolve post-war disputes between the three galactic governments, Natasi Daala of the Galactic Alliance, Turr Phennir of the Confederation, and Jagged Fel of the Imperial Remnant. On the sidelines, the Hapes Consortium of Hapes, led by Tenel Ka Djo, also agreed to unite with the larger galaxy during the signing of the galactic treaty. However, Natasi Daala, Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance, ordered Luke Skywalker to be exiled for 10 years for not stopping Darth Caedus. His sentence would be dismissed if he could find the reason as to why Caedus turned to the dark side. During his exile, several Jedi succumbed to Force psychosis which resulted in the involvement of Galactic Alliance Security and caused the Galactic Alliance to take a hostile stance against the New Jedi Order.\n\nChief Daala's draconian reign abruptly ended when the Jedi launched a preemptive strike in 44 ABY to remove Daala from power by force. Due to her growing unpopularity with the Jedi Order, the Senate and the citizens of the Galactic Alliance, Daala's fall from grace was virtually uncontested and many were well pleased to be rid of her. In lieu of the unprecedented situation, the Office of the Chief of State was indefinitely suspended and its executive authority was invested in a constitutionally appointed replacement\u2014the Triumvirate.\n\nThe first of the triumvirs were Grand Master Saba Sebatyne of the Jedi Order, Senator Haydnat Treen of the Galactic Alliance Senate, and General Merratt Jaxton of the Galactic Alliance Starfighter Command. Together, the three triumvirs quickly consolidated their rule over the Galactic Alliance from Coruscant, all the while representing the collective interests of the Jedi Order, the Senate and the Armed Forces. Abeloth eventually managed to take power by posing as a potential candidate of the leader of Coruscant, leading the Sith into Coruscant. In addition, a large portion of Coruscant was devastated by seismic activity caused by Abeloth as a means to get away from the Jedi. After Abeloth's defeat, Wynn Dorvan became the next Chief of State.\n\n",

This forced Chief of State Mon Mothma to consider a last-minute plan for the defense of the galactic capital. However, she never got a chance since the combined Imperial armada began bombarding Coruscant's energy shield from orbit, causing extensive damage to the heavily populated cityscape below. Mon Mothma then ordered a general evacuation of the entire population of the capital. Thus, the Empire had retaken its Center and the New Republic resorted to guerrilla fighting.\n\nHowever, after Coruscant had been retaken, the Council decided that it was time to elect a new Galactic Emperor. The various admirals, generals, Moffs, Inquisitorius, COMPNOR and Imperial Security Bureau officials disagreed, and an armed conflict soon broke out amongst the various Imperial factions on Coruscant. At the height of the infighting, the equivalent of three sector fleets divided among twelve factions annihilated each other in Coruscant's skies, while orbital bombardments were ordered, terror troops destroyed reactors to weaken the planetary shields, and counter-insurgents fought openly in city streets and walkways. The city planet was devastated during the conflict with much of the planet-wide metropolis devastated by the fighting and the deaths of billions. The space around Coruscant was littered with the wreckage of starships which would not be cleared for years. However, eventually the cloned Palpatine appeared, claiming that he was Emperor, and ended the Imperial Civil War.

        "content": "# Coruscant - Clone Wars[]\n\nIn 22 BBY, the Clone Wars erupted when the newly created Grand Army of the Republic attacked the Confederate-controlled world of Geonosis. Coruscant experienced a number of radical changes during the galaxy-spanning conflict. Large swaths of the cityscape were laid low to make room for the construction of military staging areas. Millions of citizens were displaced by the urban renewal, most of them impoverished, members of alien species loyal to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, or both. Initially, there was public outcry, but such dissidence was either ignored or quashed. Acts of terrorism were also commonplace, with indiscriminate tactics such as bombings resulting in hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of casualties. Most were the products of Separatist cells, while some isolated incidents were of questionable origin. Assassination attempts on influential Republic politicians were common.\n\nIncidents included the raid of Ziro's palace after the Republic discovered the Hutt's affiliation with Count Dooku; the holding of Senator Meena Tills hostage by Korunnai terrorists which was actually cover for an attempt to turn the Corporate Sector against the Republic; and the Senate hostage crisis at the Republic Executive Building that was carried out by bounty hunter Cad Bane to free Ziro the Hutt. The year 21 BBY saw a wave of such disasters, including the Coruscant Insurrection by Count Dooku and Dark Jedi Trenox to steal a holocron at the Jedi Temple; the bombing of the freighter Star of Iskin that killed former Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum and thousands on the surface as a result of raining debris; a terrorist attack on a power generator that resulted in power outages and fires throughout the Senate District; the assassination of Senator Viento by rogue Jedi Quinlan Vos; and the murders of Senator Onaconda Farr and Senator Mee Deechi by Farr's personal aide Lolo Purs.\n\nAlso, at some point during the Clone Wars, there was an incident involving a Zillo Beast from Malastare. After the creature was transported to Coruscant by order of Chancellor Palpatine, the Zillo Beast was subjected to examination and experimentation. When Palpatine ordered its destruction in order to hasten the procedure, the Zillo Beast broke free and immediately sought vengeance on the man who was intent on killing it. As it rampaged through Galactic City, thousands of citizens tried to flee in terror while the Jedi and their clone forces scrambled to neutralize the creature. Upon reaching the Executive Building, the Zillo Beast nearly succeeded in killing the Chancellor, only for its efforts to be thwarted by the Jedi. Although they succeeded in killing it, Chancellor Palpatine discreetly ordered that the Zillo Beast be cloned to conduct further research.\n\nSuch incidents prompted the Republic to implement numerous changes on Coruscant in the name of increased security. Clone troopers of the Republic's newly formed Grand Army were dispatched throughout the planet on regular patrols as the capital's military guard. The fanatically pro-Human COMPOR was founded; the local SAGroup, led by Nenevanth Tion, marched in a parade of Republic patriotism on Coruscant. COMPOR pressured Tannon Praji into deporting from the capital all members of species whose homeworld had joined the Confederacy.\nFollowing the Star of Iskin incident, the Senate approved the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act, which allowed Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to strip civil liberties in the name of civil security. Coruscant fell under particularly heavy government supervision, with security becoming gradually tighter as one traveled deeper into the levels of the Galactic City.\n\nThe planet's lower levels, which had once been a haven for crime and an unregulated market, became heavily subdued, such that illicit goods and services became difficult to find. While most Coruscanti were content with surrendering these and other liberties for security, the changes did not sit well with the galactic capital's alien population, particularly those that were associated with the leadership of the Confederacy. Many Geonosians, Muuns, Neimoidians, and Gossams suffered ostracization on Coruscant, while many others were forced to flee the world altogether. In addition, numerous rumors surfaced regarding antiwar demonstrations that were quelled with forceful measures, seizure of private property, and disappearances. As disturbing as these abuses of power were, proof of the acts was either nonexistent or easily discredited. Throughout the remainder of the war, the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act was altered by amendments known as the Security Acts, which, although intended to further enhance security throughout the Republic, also contributed to Palpatine's growing power over the government and the weakening of the authority of the Galactic Senate.",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Reconstruction and war's end[]\n\nAfter Palpatine's final death in 11 ABY at the Battle of Onderon, the New Republic retook the planet and used EVS Construction Droids to clear the rubble and create new, gleaming skyscrapers. While Coruscant had suffered severe damage during the Imperial Civil War, the solar mirrors remained in their orbits and no irreversible damage had been done to the planet itself. Many urban centers remained mostly intact, and, most critically, the major water distribution systems were largely undamaged. New Republic civil and military forces received funding from the Senate to begin rebuilding the planet's infrastructure, particularly government facilities such as Imperial City and the Imperial Palace. Another priority was the clearing of hazardous debris drifting in orbit, which posed a danger to essential shipments of consumables. After several months of work, the New Republic Defense Fleet had cleared safe zones through the debris, and shipping resumed a somewhat regular schedule. Most of the key Imperial City areas were largely restored, and within a year the metropolis had returned to its usual administrative and business activities. However, the shadowy lower levels remained unaffected by the reconstruction programmed and would still remain the haunt of various crime syndicates. Many still struggled to survive in the lower forty or fifty levels.\n\nIn 17 ABY, following the Black Fleet Crisis, while Leia Organa Solo was preparing for a speech, the Senate Building was attacked and severely damaged by Brakiss and Dolph, forcing a nearly complete renovation.\n\nIn 19 ABY, following the signing of the Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty by Imperial Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon and New Republic Chief of State Ponc Gavrisom on the Chimaera, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade planned to wed on Coruscant. However, one year later, during the wedding ceremony, a group of Imperial partisans attempted to sabotage it including infiltrating the event site and hiring a swoop gang to disrupt the wedding.\n\nThe wedding started with a bachelor party in the lower levels before attending a private Jedi ceremony in the renovated Jedi Temple. The public ceremony at Coruscant's Reflection Gardens remained largely peaceful because Booster Terrik and several others kept the swoop gang at bay. Lastly, when the final Imperial partisan attempted to unleash a computer virus, Luke persuaded him to surrender and to join the party.\n\nIn 22 ABY, the Second Imperium infiltrated the Coruscant system by using the cloaked Shadow Academy to remain in orbit above the planet, invisible to the eyes of the New Republic military presence and Coruscant Planetary Defense Force. A Second Imperium force consisting of the former TIE pilot Qorl's assault shuttle and several modified TIE Fighters also boarded the bulk cruiser Adamant and fled into hyperspace with its valuable cargo of starship hyperdrives.\n\nThe Imperium also sent three Nightsisters named Tamith Kai, Garowyn and Vilas to infiltrate the lower levels and recruit more followers for their cause including the street gang Lost Ones and Zekk. Those discovered to be Force-sensitive became Dark Jedi while others became Stormtroopers and TIE pilots. However, Jedi trainees Jaina Solo, Jacen Solo, Tenel Ka Djo and Lowbacca used several solar mirrors to burn out the Shadow Academy's cloaking systems, exposing it to the New Republic fleet. The station powered its hyperdrive and escaped into hyperspace.\n\n",

During the reigns of the Old Republic and the Galactic Alliance, Coruscant was represented in the Senate. As the center of galactic government, Coruscant thrived on politics and the business of government. However, this also opened up huge opportunities for greed and corruption. The Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic did exercise some control over Coruscant's administration though he did not interfere with the day-to-day affairs of government. This practice continued well throughout the era of the Galactic Empire with the Emperor, but Moffs were placed in command over the mayor of Imperial City in the form of the Imperial Sector. During the New Republic and the Galactic Alliance, the Chief of State exercised overall control of Coruscant but stayed out of day-to-day affairs.\n\nUntil 27 ABY, Galactic/Imperial City, had a mayor who led the City Municipal Authority. Several of the planet's sectors also had their own local mayors and governments. The Yuuzhan Vong took direct control over Coruscant establishing a theocratic dictatorship without a local government. This lasted until the Galactic Alliance retook the planet from the Vong in 29 ABY. The Galactic Alliance then established the Galactic City Authority, which managed Coruscant's government and the planet's day to day affairs.\n\n",

The Galactic Triumvirate was set up after the war to merge the various factions into one, cohesive government. With Coruscant's liberation and the final death of Darth Krayt, the One Sith quickly lost their hold over the galaxy as the Empire collapsed into ruin without the leadership of its Emperor. The surviving members of the One Sith fled into hiding while the victorious allies united as one to form the Galactic Federation Triumvirate, headed by Master K'Kruhk of the New Jedi Order, Admiral Gar Stazi of the Alliance, and Empress Marasiah Fel of the Empire.\n\nThe new government immediately set about restoring stability to the galaxy. Reconstruction efforts began on the planet Coruscant which had suffered damage during the battle to seize it from the Sith. The Imperial Mission, abused by Darth Krayt, was disbanded. However, efforts to improve the galaxy's infrastructure were continued beginning with a communications array that would link the Outer Rim sectors with the Core Worlds.

        "content": "# Coruscant - Galactic Alliance[]\n\nThe Galactic Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong signed a peace treaty in 29 ABY, thus ending the Yuuzhan Vong War, and not long after, terminated the Yuuzhan Vong Empire and the Peace Brigade. It was decided that Coruscant would be rebuilt as the capital of the Galactic Alliance, returning to the ecumenopolis-style whenever possible while leaving the Yuuzhan Vong terraforming wherever it was as yet unfeasible to change. The World Brain would still remain in the Senate Building, as there was as yet no way to remove it without causing further damage to the planet.\n\nAs the government transferred back to the world from Denon in 30 ABY, buildings such as the Senate Building were remodeled, new buildings were constructed such as the Defense Force headquarters and the New Jedi Temple. With this move, the Galactic Alliance had officially taken authority of the galaxy. A large park called Unity Green was also constructed to symbolize the treaty between the Yuuzhan Vong and the Galactic Alliance.\n\nCoruscant began to appear as bustling and thriving as it once did during the Old Republic with the effects of the Yuuzhan Vong War still a reminder, from the growth on skyscrapers, to the altered night sky. Air traffic in skylanes was still the primary mode of transportation.\n\nAround the time of the Second Galactic Civil War in 40 ABY, the Galactic Alliance Guard (GAG), a secret police organization, was formed by the Galactic Alliance to spy on and monitor Corellian terrorist activity on Coruscant. The Guard was led by Jacen Solo, a Jedi Knight, a Colonel of the Galactic Alliance military, and also an aspiring Sith Lord.\n\nThe GAG were responsible for interning and deporting Corellian citizens in Galactic City, and in some cases, executing those taken during the raids. Thus, because of these harsh actions and their dark military uniforms, members of the Guard earned a fast reputation as a uncompromising band of hard-liners among the population. Members of the Coruscant Security Force gave them the nickname \"Stormies,\" thus drawing inevitable comparisons of Jacen Solo to the late Darth Vader and the troops themselves to stormtroopers.\n\nUnder Solo's leadership the soldiers saw a likeness within Solo with Vader's own command style, noting that he \"never asked of them what he would not do himself.\" Though necessary in some respects, the GAG's actions were mainly a vehicle for Solo's rise to the position of Sith Lord. This would only deepen the rift between the Galactic Alliance and the Corellian-led secessionist movement.\n\nIn the same year, Solo, now the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, was attacked by Kyle Katarn and three other Jedi Knights in front of the Senate building. Katarn was deeply wounded and one of the Knights had lost his life by Caedus's hand, but Katarn and the other Jedi had managed to escape. The outcome came as expected for the Jedi. Unbeknownst to the Sith, Jedi Seha Dorvald planted a tracking device on Caedus's cloak allowing the Jedi hidden on Endor to track Caedus's every move. Following Darth Caedus' death in 41 ABY at the hand of his sister, the Confederation surrendered, ending the war.\n\nTwo years later, the Unification Summit was held on Coruscant to resolve post-war disputes between the three galactic governments, Natasi Daala of the Galactic Alliance, Turr Phennir of the Confederation, and Jagged Fel of the Imperial Remnant. On the sidelines, the Hapes Consortium of Hapes, led by Tenel Ka Djo, also agreed to unite with the larger galaxy during the signing of the galactic treaty. However, Natasi Daala, Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance, ordered Luke Skywalker to be exiled for 10 years for not stopping Darth Caedus. His sentence would be dismissed if he could find the reason as to why Caedus turned to the dark side. During his exile, several Jedi succumbed to Force psychosis which resulted in the involvement of Galactic Alliance Security and caused the Galactic Alliance to take a hostile stance against the New Jedi Order.\n\nChief Daala's draconian reign abruptly ended when the Jedi launched a preemptive strike in 44 ABY to remove Daala from power by force. Due to her growing unpopularity with the Jedi Order, the Senate and the citizens of the Galactic Alliance, Daala's fall from grace was virtually uncontested and many were well pleased to be rid of her. In lieu of the unprecedented situation, the Office of the Chief of State was indefinitely suspended and its executive authority was invested in a constitutionally appointed replacement\u2014the Triumvirate.",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Behind the scenes[]\n\nThe concept of a planet-wide city was developed by George Lucas as the Imperial capital in the Rough Draft and Revised Rough Draft of the script for Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi. In the Rough Draft of the script for Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the Imperial capital was named Alderaan, but Alderaan ultimately became the name of Leia Organa's homeworld. During the development of Return of the Jedi, the planet was called Had Abbadon. However, it was realized that such a city on screen would be impossible given the technical limitations at the time, thus the planet did not appear in the fim.\n\nThe capital was introduced in Star Wars media by the 1991 Expanded Universe novel, Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn, who chose to name it \"Coruscant\". Prior to that, the \"Imperial Capitol\" or \"Imperial Center\" was first mentioned in fiction in Marvel Comics' Star Wars (1977) 61 in 1982 and then briefly appeared in images of archival video seen in Star Wars (1977) 63.\n\nCoruscant was first seen on screen in the 1997 Special Edition release of Return of the Jedi, and later appeared in the prequel trilogy. After considering different names for the planet, Lucas decided or talked into to use \"Coruscant\". The name \"Coruscant\" is therefore one of the few Expanded Universe elements that made its way in to the films. As Zahn recalled the decision during Celebration III:\n\n\"Just to make it clear, I did not invent the planet\u2026George Lucas had invented the planetwide city a long time ago. When I was starting the Thrawn Trilogy, they told me to coordinate with the West End Games source material, and they had it listed as the Imperial Planet. Well nobody names a planet 'Imperial Planet,' so I thought it needed a name, so I picked the word that means glittering: 'Coruscant.' Apparently, when it came time to choose a name [for the films], people persuaded George to go with Coruscant and be done with it. So I felt very vindicated -- the tail wagging the dog. It was an honor to be slipped into the movies this way.\"\n\nThe word \"coruscant\" is traditionally pronounced in English with a hard \"c\" and with the stress on the second syllable \u2013 /k\u0259\u02c8\u0279\u028csk\u0259nt/ (ko'-rus-kant'), and this was indeed the pronunciation usually used in early audiobooks and audio plays, such as the audio adaptations of Tales of the Jedi and Dark Empire or Chuck Benson's reading of The Thrawn Trilogy. However, since the release of The Phantom Menace, the word is usually pronounced /'k\u0254\u0279\u0259s\u0251nt/ (ko'-ru-sant) in the Star Wars universe, with stress on the first syllable and the second \"c\" silent.\n\nIn various novels, characters aligned with the Empire refer to Coruscant as Imperial Center. Within the stories, this is explained as an administrative renaming undertaken to emphasize the differences between the Galactic Republic and its successor state, the Empire.\n\nThe PC game Star Wars: Rebellion mistakenly places Coruscant in the Sesswenna sector, itself a misspelling of the Seswenna sector of the Core. The Seswenna sector is actually located in the Outer Rim.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Yuuzhan'tar[]\n\nCoruscant's darkest hour was at the peak of the Yuuzhan Vong War. During the Fall of Coruscant, the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong overwhelmed the Republic defenses in three attack waves and conquered the planet. Coruscant, which had been completely covered in city sprawl for millennia, was devastated during the assault. Billions of lives were also lost during the battle.\n\nMany of the landmarks of Coruscant either met their end or were altered to suit the invaders' needs. The Imperial Palace was destroyed when Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya detonated a suicide bomb in his office; the Manarai Mountains, the last part of the planet untouched by cityscape, were blasted into giant craters; the Western Sea, the planet's sole body of water at the time, was turned into a giant Succession pool; the Senate Building became the location of the World Brain, which was in charge of the terraforming of the planet. It was at this event the Yuuzhan Vong Empire was formed, since they had claimed the galactic capital.\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong designated it Yuuzhan'tar, after their ancient homeworld, and terraformed it to overwhelm the city covering its surface and restore a natural ecology. In order to get Yuuzhan'tar to match their original homeworld, large dovin basals pulled the planet closer to Coruscant Prime and biological processes were set forth to create the jungle including increasing the temperature and releasing more moisture into the atmosphere. Soon, nearly the entire planetwide city was covered beneath vegetation while rivers filled canyons where airspeeders had once roamed before. The lower levels were the domain of wildlife brought in from the Yuuzhan Vong galaxy and was where most of the outcast Shamed Ones lived.\n\nCoruscant's three smaller moons were dragged from their original orbits by dovin basals while its largest moon was destroyed by tidal stress created by pulses from other yammosk-linked dovin basals. A similar technique dragged the resulting expanse of dust, rock and hardening magma into a wide spreading asteroid belt known as the Rainbow Bridge, that they were familiar with. The Rainbow Bridge orbited Coruscant around at an angle of 17 degrees from the ecliptic.\n\nThe vast majority of the planet's non-Yuuzhan Vong population retreated into the planet's lower levels to avoid Yuuzhan Vong persecution. Millions of the citizens were sent into inhabited systems in camp ships. During the occupation, the residents of the city called its substructure the \"new\" Coruscant Necropolis A resistance movement of shopkeepers-turned-guerrilla fighters also emerged in the bottom levels of the Petrax Historic Quarter. After the fall of their homeworld, many former residents of Coruscant fled to Galantos, noting the lack of interest the Yuuzhan Vong showed in conquering the Farlax sector, where Galantos was located.\n\nWhen the living planet Zonama Sekot suddenly arrived in the system, it collapsed the Rainbow Bridge, caused another of Coruscant's moons to be ejected from orbit, and pulled Coruscant closer to its original orbit, causing volcanic eruptions and groundquakes for the first time in two thousand years. The newly formed Galactic Federation of Free Alliances retook Coruscant from the Yuuzhan Vong during the Recapture of Coruscant.\n\n",

Many Rescue Ops were poorly educated and underpaid, as their work was thought more fitting for droids. At the higher end of the Rescue Ops were Coruscant's fire-fighting teams; they piloted firespeeders, wore fire and radiation-proof body suits (including bronze helmets), and were equipped with fire-suppression backpacks that fed handheld hose-guns. These teams protected the endless urban sprawl from disastrous fires and explosions. Their duties were later continued by Coruscant Fire and Rescue during the Galactic Alliance.\n\nThe Coruscant Health Administration was charged with protecting the populace from various diseases and infections that could develop and spread in a large city. They also focused on issues of drugs such as death sticks and inoculations for new immigrants and migrants. They worked together with medcenters to ensure the general health of the population. However, the lower levels were mostly left to their own devices. Few had access to proper health care, police, or fire services. Most of these services were concentrated on the upper levels.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Great Peace of the Republic[]\n\nOne attack on Coruscant took place over 1000 years before the Clone Wars. In 335 BBY, the Coruscanti government introduced granite slugs, a species of land mollusks, to the planet's undercity to aid in efforts to clean up refuse that had accumulated over centuries. Over time, the slug population exploded, and while the appearance of the paved areas in the undercity was greatly improved, the slugs also served as a food source for predators that had previously been contained. In 110 BBY, many Blood Carvers relocated from their homeworld of Batorine to Coruscant, where they became famous for their wood carvings. In later decades, Prince Xizor, a Falleen of royal blood, used his fortune as the head of Xizor Transport Systems to raze Coruscant's historic Farfalla skyscraper and construct a castle in its place from the sub-foundations up.\n\nIn 33 BBY, terrorist organization The Flail, accusing the Galactic Senate of corruption, disrupted public services of Coruscant, including commerce, communications, traffic, and weather, destroying property and lives while doing so. They were stopped by agents of Finis Valorum.\n\nIn 32 BBY, the violent criminal gang Black Heth started terrorizing the Coruscant Underworld. The Jin'ha group was supplying weapons, but the Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi intervened and stopped the criminal activity. Later that year, Queen Amidala of Naboo escaped a Trade Federation blockade of her homeworld, and on Coruscant her attempts to persuade the Senate to aid Naboo were thwarted by bureaucracy and political maneuvering. In frustration, she called for a Vote of No Confidence in the embattled Supreme Chancellor Valorum, paving the way for Naboo senator Palpatine to take his place.\n\nIn 30 BBY, Jedi Masters Peerce and J'Mikel were killed by the bounty hunter Aurra Sing, who was wanted for the murder of several other Jedi, while searching for her on Coruscant. Xiaan Amersu, J'Mikel's Padawan, reported the incident to the Jedi High Council at the Jedi Temple, where a mission to capture Sing was organized.\n\nIn 27 BBY, Coruscant was almost destroyed by Ashaar Khorda using the Infant of Shaa. Jango Fett, Zam Wesell, and Yarael Poof saved Coruscant, although Poof sacrificed himself to do so. News of this averted disaster was never widely divulged, however. In the same year, Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth and his Padawan, Lorana Jinzler, interrupted a meeting between Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and his aide, Kinman Doriana, on Coruscant to demand more funding for C'baoth's proposed Outbound Flight Project. The sides came to an agreement that if C'baoth could resolve a mining strike on the planet Barlok, it would free up enough funds to finish the project, after which Palpatine ordered Doriana to keep watch over C'boath. Doriana returned to his apartment to pack and contacted his true master, Darth Sidious. After C'baoth received permission from the Jedi Council to travel to Barlok, Master Mace Windu ordered Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, to follow C'baoth to his destination.\n\n",

Bypassing the heavily fortified Corellian sector by use of secret hyperspace routes through the Deep Core provided by Darth Sidious, a Separatist fleet under the command of the dreaded General Grievous took the city planet completely unaware. While the Separatist ships engaged the Republic home defense fleet, an army of battle droids descended upon Galactic City. The invasion distracted the defending Jedi and clone forces while General Grievous and a squad of his elite MagnaGuards captured Chancellor Palpatine. However, Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi succeeded in rescuing the Supreme Chancellor from the infamous Separatist flagship Invisible Hand. The Battle of Coruscant eventually turned in the Republic's favor, and the Separatist armada was forced into a full retreat. However, the battle had shaken much of the population, and large portions of the city had been decimated by falling ships or collateral damage caused in the vicious fighting.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine brought about the destruction of the Jedi Order by issuing Order 66 to all clone troopers throughout the galaxy from his executive office. In the Grand Convocation Chamber of the Senate Building, Palpatine announced the creation of his New Order to the Galactic Senate. With the Jedi all but destroyed, Palpatine proclaimed his intentions to reorganize the Republic into the first Galactic Empire, and thus declared himself Emperor. Meanwhile, Alderaanian senator Bail Organa, having witnessed the massacre at the Jedi Temple, transported surviving Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Coruscant, where, at the Temple, the two Jedi dismantled a coded signal urging Jedi to gather there. Yoda later confronted Palpatine at the Senate Building, but failed to kill him.",

        "content": "# Coruscant - New Republic takeover[]\n\nIn 6.5 ABY, the famous New Republic starfighter squadron Rogue Squadron under their leader Wedge Antilles was sent undercover to infiltrate Coruscant and sabotage the planet's powerful shield generator. To do this, they hijacked a construction droid and used it to transport them to a command center where they used one of the planet's orbital mirrors to evaporate a large amount of reservoir water, thus creating a powerful electrical storm which brought down the shields. This allowed a New Republic fleet under the famed Admiral Gial Ackbar to enter the Coruscant system and capture the galactic capital on 42:2:17.\n\nHowever, within days of the victory, millions of Coruscant's non-Human population started to die due to the Krytos virus. Since only Humans were immune to the virus, this drove a wedge between the New Republic's member species. Worse, Ysanne Isard used the Lusankya to escape Coruscant and flee to the planet Thyferra despite the efforts of Rogue Squadron. In the process, the Lusankya caused devastation to over 100 square miles (259 km\u00b2) of the planet's surface, killing millions of inhabitants instantly. It then blasted its way through the two planetary shield levels, pausing to exchange fire with an orbiting Golan III Space Defense NovaGun before jettisoning the lift cradle and departing the Coruscant system. Later, New Republic scientists developed a cure for the Krytos virus by mixing bacta with a rare grade of the spice ryll, known as kor. This prevented further loss of alien life, though inter-species relationships remained volatile for some time.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Inconsistencies[]\n\nIn the large volume of material relating to Coruscant, there are conflicting statements about the ecumenopolis; inconsistencies are found mainly in sources released before 1999 when Coruscant was visually established in The Phantom Menace.\n\nMost sources, including all illustrations, show Coruscant as having negligible surface water, save for the ice caps. However, the Black Fleet Crisis trilogy states that Coruscant has two continents, a large one that contains Imperial City and a smaller one. More than half of this version of the Coruscant is an ocean. No other source follows this version, though The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook does refer to distinct continents, and the discrepancy is usually solved by referring to the alleged ocean as the artificial Western Sea.\n\nThe intro of the 1994 game Star Wars: TIE Fighter shows an orbital view of Coruscant that looks very similar to how the planet would appear in the prequel movies five years later. However, the Collector's edition, which features a remade intro, shows an Earth-like Coruscant, blue with clouds.\n\nAnother depiction of Coruscant, shown in the Shadows of the Empire comic, shows Coruscant as a terrestrial planet as opposed to an ecumenopolis, including green continents and a very large body of water.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Fauna[]\n\nFugitive animals were a large component of the city-planet Coruscant's \"wild\" fauna. Many exotic trophy species were smuggled in from other planets for the pleasure of Coruscanti citizens. Often, these creatures remained too wild or dangerous to be domesticated, and were either surreptitiously released into Coruscant's artificial environment or escaped on their own from animal traders. One such species were the narglatch, a species that made cute pets when young, though they invariably caused problems once they began to grow to maturity. Some of the more dangerous predatory animals even killed and ate their masters before escaping.\n\nThough they were far from their homeworlds, many of these escaped species were able to eke out an existence on Coruscant. Some animals migrated to certain areas, like the wampas who adapted to Coruscant's cooler polar regions. The lower levels of Coruscant were infested by dangerous creatures like anoobas, saw-toothed granks, and veermoks, who feasted on garbage or on other creatures. Sometimes, these creatures made it too dangerous for the inhabitants of the lower levels to go out at night.\n\nAdditionally, a limited number of Coruscant's native species survived well into the planet's urbanization into an ecumenopolis. Most notably, the hawk-bat was a bird-like species that survived by preying on granite slugs, which were a species of slug that adapted to live on the vertical surfaces of buildings. The only other species known to survive was the thrantcill.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Law enforcement[]\n\nOne of the oldest planetary police forces in the galaxy, the Coruscant Security Force (CSF) served as the primary law enforcement during most of Coruscant's history, especially during the Galactic Republic, the New Republic, and the Galactic Alliance. It worked closely with the Senate Guard and the Jedi Peacekeepers during the Old Republic, but maintained ultimate control of policing the planet. This included regular patrols of the various districts and neighborhoods of Galactic City, criminal investigations, counter-terror, counter-espionage operations, crowd control at major events, and public disturbances, maintaining the planet's skylanes, handing out speeding tickets, diplomatic protection, and responding to a variety of other emergencies and situations.\n\nDuring the later years of the Republic, foot patrol on the upper levels was mainly the responsibility of police droids, though humanoid and organic police officers were also present especially in the underworld police detective division, and special units. Special units existed for various tasks including SWAT teams, Forensics Unit, the Organized Crime Unit, the Anti-Terrorism Unit, the Tactical and Operational force, the Customs Enforcement Division, and the CSF's Traffic Division which was charged with maintaining order in the massive skylanes of Galactic City.\n\nDuring the Galactic Empire, the Coruscant Guard was placed in overall command of Coruscant's security, but the CSF continued as a police force though subservient to the Guard. After the formation of the New Republic, the Guard was disbanded and the CSF were returned to their primary status which continued throughout the Galactic Alliance. When the threat of a new civil war between Corellia and the Galactic Alliance threatened the safety of Coruscant, several CSF officers joined the new Galactic Alliance Guard. However as the war continued and the GAG's methods became more and more brutal, most CSF officers left and returned to the CSF.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - New Galactic Empire[]\n\nIn 130 ABY, control of Coruscant was wrested from the grip of the Galactic Alliance during the final days of the Sith\u2013Imperial War. With the fall of the Alliance and the Jedi retreat to Ossus, the galactic capital fell to the resurgent Empire, by then under the command of Emperor Roan Fel. Bastion was then replaced by Coruscant as the Imperial throne world, thus restoring the urban-wide planet as the heart of the Empire once more. Fel's control over Coruscant did not last for long, however, as the Empire's Sith allies launched a coup d'\u00e9tat, forcing Fel and his loyalist supporters into exile. With Coruscant under Sith control, the Sith Lord Darth Krayt declared himself Emperor of a new Galactic Empire.\n\nSeven years later, Darth Wyyrlok assassinated Darth Krayt and took control of the Galactic Empire during the Second Imperial Civil War. Krayt, however, managed to cheat death and returned to Coruscant a year later to reclaim his throne. Wyyrlok was slain in the Sith Temple and with his death, Coruscant and the Empire were once more under the rule of Krayt.\n\nThough the Dark Lord's return resulted in the Empire's rejuvenated war effort against its enemies, Krayt's revival also pushed them to the point of desperation. Thus, the Empire-in-exile, Galactic Alliance Remnant and the New Jedi Order combined their strengths to launch a major offensive on the Imperial capital. Their objective was to seize Coruscant in the hopes of destroying the Galactic Empire along with its Emperor and his Sith followers.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Center of the New Republic[]\n\nControlling Coruscant was the key to the Galactic Civil War for the New Republic. Imperial City was renamed once more to Galactic City and the former official name Imperial Center was abandoned. After Isard's loss of Coruscant and her retreat to Thyferra, fragmentation within the Empire deepened as the Imperials lost faith in their leaders and the survivors of the Imperial Inner Circle were found once again providing a tenuous central authority for the Empire. They supported the Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn as Supreme Commander\u2014mistakenly believing that as an alien, and with no standing in their rarefied political world, he would necessarily remain beholden to their patronage and government.\n\nIn 8 ABY, Coruscant was visited by the Hapes Consortium which surrounded the planet with a fleet of Hapan Battle Dragons, marking the first time in millennia that the insular society had made significant contact with the rest of the galaxy since the Consortium sealed its borders around 3100 BBY. At the Grand Reception Hall, the Hapan delegates presented the New Republic with many magnificent gifts including several captured Imperial Star Destroyers.\n\nHowever, the final gift would be the most shocking of them all. The Hapan Queen Mother's son and heir Isolder presented himself to Councilor Leia Organa as a marriage suitor. Despite realizing the benefits of an arranged marriage between the two factions, she was still romantically attached to Han Solo. Following an adventure on Dathomir and the defeat of the Imperial warlord Zsinj at the hands of the Hapan fleet, Han Solo and Leia Organa married during a wedding ceremony at the Alderaanian consulate on Coruscant. This was attended by hundreds of friends and officials and viewed on holovid by billions across the galaxy.\n\nIn 9 ABY, during the Thrawn Crisis, Grand Admiral Thrawn's fleet besieged the galactic capital on 44:8:11. Since his forces were outnumbered by the New Republic defenses of Coruscant, he used cloaking technology to create an effective siege weapon. To do this, he fitted 22 asteroids with cloaking devices and placed them onboard his Star Destroyers. During the battle, Thrawn placed the asteroids in low orbit, then retreated into hyperspace, creating an invisible hazard field around the galactic capital. As a result, the New Republic was faced with two major problems: they could not drop the energy shield around the planet in case an asteroid hit the heavily populated cityscape, nor could they allow space traffic near the planet in case of collision. This left Coruscant effectively blockaded. After Thrawn died at the Battle of Bilbringi, on 44:8:27, the blockade was lifted and Coruscant was free again.\n\n",

One of the oldest members of the Galactic Republic, it was a planet full of lush life, and the planet's surface had not a touch of civilization on it. The Ithorians themselves, otherwise known as \"Hammerheads,\" built great floating cities that did not harm the surface, which they considered to be sacred. Entry upon the surface was forbidden, unless one stayed there permanently. Some Ithorians such as the Oracle were compelled to go down to the planet surface, however, as they \"heard the call\" of Mother Jungle, the Ithorian religion's personification of Ithor's world-spanning jungle. The surface of the planet of Ithor played host to numerous plants, including the bafforr tree, which possessed telepathic capabilities. The planet contained andurite stone, and every three Ithorian years was the center of the Time of Meeting. The planet had many moons in its night sky.\n\n",

Following the Ithorian belief in the Law of Life, most Ithorians never actually set foot on their own planet, instead they lived in floating cities above their world called herdships. Only three of their continents had been explored and harvested, the other two never having been touched by Ithorian hands, demonstrating their devout belief in the protection and sustainability of their environment.\n\nSuch protectionism toward their environment gave rise to numerous native plants and animals.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Imperial City[]\n\nCoruscant's surface was defined by its urban sprawl, which collectively was called Galactic City until it was officially renamed as Imperial City during the Imperial Era. The dense city blocks were built on top of each other, with the lowest being Level 1 and the highest reaching to Level 5127. The lowest known habitable level was Level 5. At its highest level, Galactic City's skyscrapers were built with many reaching 6,000 meters into the atmosphere, with sleek, transparisteel edifices standing next to older duracrete structures. As a hustling, bustling planet-wide city with an underworld full of dark alleys and an abundance of people, Coruscant provided the ideal conditions for a thief to prosper, especially targeting tourists from quieter planets.\n\nGalactic City was divided into sectors named by designated coordinates. Some sectors also had unofficial names; for example, sector H-46 was the nicknamed of \"Sah'c Town\" due to the Sah'c family's ownership of much of the sector. Sectors were further divided into zones, with zones determined by purpose, such as financial, senatorial, or industrial zones.\n\nUnder the Galactic Republic, the Federal District, also called the Senate District, was the center of political activity on the planet, as it was home to both the Senate Building, seat of the Galactic Senate, and the Senate Office Building, where the Supreme Chancellor had his or her own set of offices. It served as the main district for government buildings and institutions including the City Municipal Authorities Building and the Galactic Courts of Justice. The Federal District was also the location of the Jedi Temple, headquarters of Jedi Order, as well as 500 Republica, a massive residential tower home to the most powerful on Coruscant.\n\nUnder the rule of the Galactic Empire, the Federal District was transformed and heavily fortified, and the Jedi Temple was repurposed as the Imperial Palace. The palace became a part of the \"supreme triangle\" of structures alongside the Imperial Inspectorate HQ and the massive COMPNOR arcology, which housed the city-block-sized ISB Central Office of the Imperial Security Bureau. Next to the Federal District was the Verity District, which under the Empire housed the Hall of Adjudication, the Hall of Imperial Register, the Institute to Preserve Imperial History, and the ISB Academy and Offices.\n\nThe planet's skylanes directed the air-traffic of airspeeders via auto-navigation system that moved the speeders along preprogrammed routes. As such crashes were extremely rare. Precautions were taken though with and skytunnels incorporating bombproof shields and high-level tracking systems, and most structures on Coruscant had defensive shields to protect windows from stray and out-of-control vehicles.\n\nOwing to the planet's prominence in terms of galactic affairs, Galactic City housed numerous governmental offices and inter-galactic headquarters in its winding depths. The central planning strategy offices of the food giant Tagge Corporation could be found within the city, along with the droid research institutes funded by Cybot Galactica, and the Bank of the Core, one of the galaxy's largest financial institutions. The towers were symbols of power and authority, and the largest could hold populations of well over a million.\n\nThe planet's residents were known as the Coruscanti and of the estimated trillions inhabitants of the planet, 68% were believed to be human. On Coruscant, wealth increased with altitude. The lowermost levels were devoid of light and abandoned, with Level 1 deemed uninhabitable and roaming with strange creatures and monsters; above them were lawless underlevels\u2014countless blocks inhabited by billions of middle-class workers. The super-towers on Level 5217 remained home to the ultra-wealthy. Furthering this class divide, citizens who lived in the upper levels were able to breathe air that was filtered and clean, while lower-class inhabitants were forced to breathe the air of toxic fumes from factory and vehicular waste. As such, most visitors to Coruscant chose to bring their own air supply to last the length of their stay.\n\n",

Coruscant was ancient homeworld of the Taung and Zhell species. Though debated by historians, the theory that Coruscant was the ancestral world of humans remained unproven. Noted for its cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population consisted of trillions of citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and alien species. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location at the end of several major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-planet to surpass its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture, education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology. It was the location of several major landmarks, including the Jedi Temple, Monument Plaza, and the Senate Building.\n\nServing as the capital of the galaxy since the ancient days of the old Galactic Republic, Coruscant was at the center of many historic events, such as the Jedi Order's conflict with the Sith. Although the planet fell under Sith control for a time, Republic forces ultimately liberated Coruscant with the aid of the Jedi Knights. Their victory was so decisive that at one point the Sith became all but extinct, replacing an age of darkness and strife with the democratic rule of the modern Galactic Republic. Retaining its status as galactic capital, it was on Coruscant where the Galactic Senate governed the galaxy for centuries, establishing an era of peace that lasted for almost a millennium under the protection of the Jedi peacekeepers. However, political intrigue wrought by corruption and secession transformed Coruscant into a dangerous environment by the time of the Clone Wars with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. On the eve of the New Order, fulfilling a grand scheme, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, who was, in fact, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, declared the Jedi enemies of the state, resulting in a galaxy-wide purge that all but destroyed the Jedi Order. Without the Jedi to oppose him, Palpatine dissolved the Republic and declared himself Galactic Emperor to the applause of the now Imperial Senate.\n\nCoruscant continued to serve as galactic capital under the Empire, having become the Emperor's throneworld, although Palpatine himself disappeared from public view for the most part, leaving the day-to-day governing to his advisors in the Imperial Ruling Council. The Empire maintained a firm hold on Coruscant throughout the Emperor's reign, but with his defeat at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, citizens of Coruscant celebrated by revolting. Unable to command the military's allegiance as the rebels restored the Republic, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda's rule was limited to Coruscant. Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the self-proclaimed Counselor to the Empire, in short order. Hoping to escape prosecution for war crimes, Amedda surrendered himself to the New Republic, which demanded that he surrender the entire Empire in return for amnesty. Following Rax's death at the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, Amedda signed the Galactic Concordance\u2014a peace treaty recognizing the Empire's capitulation and the end of the Galactic Civil War. Amedda himself was permitted to return to Coruscant as the head of a provisional government. Yet his authority was merely ceremonial; under the supervision of Republic overseers, he became a virtually powerless figurehead.\n\nUnlike previous galactic governments, the newly restored Galactic Senate broke with millennia of tradition by not establishing Coruscant as their headquarters, instead preferring to designate other member worlds with the status of galactic capital through an electoral system. Nevertheless, some government operations were returned to Coruscant as it was already designed to handle and administer the galaxy's infrastructure. As part of the New Republic, Coruscant enjoyed full senatorial representation and, by the time of the Cold War, was aligned with the worlds that identified as Centrists. However, by this point, Coruscant had actually fallen under the control of crime syndicates. Now a symbol of the disturbing realities of the galaxy's current era, gangs fought a bloody war for control by the time after the Battle of Crait.\n\nDuring the First Order-Resistance War, at least two sizeable battlegroup were deployed by the First Order to Coruscant in the apparent hope of seizing it and ruling the galaxy from the ecumenopolis as the Galactic Empire once did, however these efforts were defeated. In the aftermath of the Battle of Exegol, various worlds sought to drive the First Order military from their soil. Coruscant was one such world where an uprising took place as part of a galaxy-wide effort to overthrow the First Order.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Early history[]\n\nIn ancient times, Coruscant was populated by two sentient species, the Taung and the Zhell. Sometime in its distant past, Coruscant was home to a conflict between civilizations that fought for control of the planet. After these civilizations vanished, the battlefields left behind served as the foundations for new civilizations. Though its connection to the human species was unconfirmed, Coruscant was widely accepted as the human homeworld. Nevertheless, the human Axel Greylark claimed that, at least to his knowledge, the people of Coruscant did not have grand creation myths. In time, humans expanded throughout the known galaxy, exploring and colonizing vast regions of space, with Coruscant becoming the galactic center of political and cultural life. In 100,000 BBY, the lowest levels of Coruscant, such as Level 1, were once called home by the people of Coruscant. As the planet expanded up, however, the buildings turned to ancient ruins that were buried. It was believed those low levels were left uninhabitable.\n\nMany different political systems held control over Coruscant during its existence, with these systems ranging from brutal empires and dictatorships to democracies. Coruscant was one of the Galactic Republic's original Core World founders, and outmaneuvered its early rivals to become the economic and cultural engine of civilization as it expanded along newly chartered hyperspace routes. As these early hyperspace lanes became well-established trade routes, increasing numbers of alien species migrated towards Coruscant; this would accelerate the construction of new residential levels and sectors for the city-world's booming population even as the growth of its rivals slowed. Coruscant's effective status as the center of the Republic led to it being awarded the coordinates 0-0-0 on all standard navigation charts. As the centuries passed, the Galactic City expanded and 5,000 years before the Galactic Civil War, it almost covered the entire surface of the planet.\n\nThe ancient Sith Lords built a shrine on Coruscant. When the Jedi Knights ousted them, they built their temple over it. During the Jedi-Sith War, the Sith captured Coruscant, but it was later reclaimed by the Republic in the Liberation of Coruscant. Victory over the Sith at Ruusan led to the birth of the modern Galactic Republic with Coruscant as its capital. Beings from across the galaxy emigrated to Coruscant seeking opportunities on the bustling planet. However, many newcomers were ultimately relegated to low-level positions and subjected to a life of crime and violence. Nonetheless, it was largely accepted that whoever controlled Coruscant controlled the galaxy.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - High Republic Era[]\n\nOver the millennia representatives gathered in the Galactic Senate for diplomacy and dispute resolutions, creating and enforcing laws, and maintaining peace. As such, Coruscant became known as the galactic capital for thousands of years. Around 382 BBY, a Toydarian became inebriated and was arrested for disturbing the peace on Level 1392, resulting in their imprisonment on Level 2623. Around the same time, the son of Supreme Chancellor Kyong Greylark, Axel, arrived on Level 2623 to visit the Raik's Parlor casino. However, after starting a fight in the gambling den, he was arrested by members of the Coruscant Guard, who revealed they had been sent by his mother. When cult guide Marda Ro reformed the already-radicalized Path of the Open Hand into the militant Path of the Closed Fist to war against the Jedi and other Force-sensitives, she had dreams of spreading their insurgency as far as Coruscant itself, urging the Path to follow her across the stars. While the Path quickly fell under Ro's sway, the ensuing Battle of Dalna marked the destruction of the cult, although Ro herself escaped and began a new plan that culminated in the creation of the Nihil marauders.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - A capital at war[]\n\nThe Clone Wars began with the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, when the Separatist Crisis that began with the establishment of the Confederacy of Independent Systems escalated into open war between the Republic and the Separatists. In the same year, Amidala became the target of an assassination plot while she was on Coruscant opposing the Military Creation Act. The former queen-turned-senator was saved from the bounty hunters Zam Wesell and Jango Fett through the efforts of Kenobi and Skywalker. While Skywalker escorted Amidala to Naboo for her protection, Kenobi tracked Fett to the extragalactic world of Kamino where he discovered that an army of elite soldiers had been bred from Fett's genetic template. Kenobi followed Fett to Geonosis and learned that several commercial organizations pledged their resources to Count Dooku and the Separatist Droid Army.\n\nHaving learned of the Separatists' plan to attack the Republic, the Loyalist Committee gave serious consideration to using the Kaminoan clone troopers as the basis for the Republic Military. Though the Jedi Order had long stood as the Senate's instrument of peace in the galaxy, the limited number of Jedi Knights prevented them from fighting a galactic-scale conflict on their own. Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks, acting on behalf of Naboo in Amidala's absence, proposed a motion to grant emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. The Senate voted in favor of the Gungan politician's request, allowing Chancellor Palpatine to unilaterally create the Grand Army of the Republic.\n\nThe Clone Wars became one of the most turbulent times in galactic history and the first, full scale war in over a thousand years. As the capital of the Republic, Coruscant, already a hotbed of political intrigue, became a target for both military and political reasons. Situations and events that were unthinkable centuries before became commonplace. Even prior to the beginning of the war, changes could be seen in the Republic. The Senate, already corrupt and bloated found it difficult to respond, delegating emergency powers to Palpatine. The chancellor himself brought changes such as implementing the use of his personal Red Guards instead of the Senate Guards. During the Clone Wars, the Coruscant Guard was formed to serve as a clone security force for the Republic capital. Composed of elite clone shock troopers, the Coruscant Guard was led by Clone Commander Fox.\n\nAs the Grand Army and the Republic Navy spread across the galaxy to defend the Republic, the Jedi, long taking the stand of being peacekeepers instead of soldiers, led the clone troopers as commanders and generals. The dramatic changes were noted by the Jedi and the Republic citizens alike, specifically on Coruscant. Unknown to everyone except a select few, Coruscant was from where the entire war was continually manipulated by Palpatine. As Supreme Chancellor, he took overall charge of the Republic military and directed the war effort from his office in the Senate Office Building. As Darth Sidious he directed Dooku's actions designed to continue the war and further his plans.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine had the Zillo Beast from Malastare transported to Coruscant for scientific research, overruling the objections of his Jedi advisor Mace Windu. Palpatine ordered the Zillo Beast's destruction, but the creature broke out of the Republic Science and Technical Center and proceeded on a rampage across Coruscant's Senate district. The clone forces on Coruscant converged on the Zillo Beast, using poison gas to kill it while the Jedi protected the chancellor. The Senate hostage crisis was carried out by bounty hunter Cad Bane as part of a Hutt Clan plot to free Ziro Desilijic Tiure. While clone troopers had already started to see open use on Coruscant at that point, the failure of Senate Guards during the incident became a justification for the continued use of clones on the capital itself. In fact, clones came to replace Senate Commandos as Coruscant-based additional security and fast-action response military forces.\n\nThe Confederate\u2013Republic peace initiative was disrupted by the bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid by planetside Separatist agents. Consequently, the Senate voted to deregulate the banking industry, allowing the Republic to take on additional loans for the purpose of purchasing more clones for its army. Unbeknown to the Senate, the attack was supported by Senators Nix Card and Lott Dod, whose respective organizations, the InterGalactic Banking Clan and the Trade Federation, profited from the Clone Wars.",

        "content": "# Coruscant - The end of peace[]\n\nIt was towards the end of the Republic Era that the Sith Lord Darth Sidious executed his plans for galactic domination, beginning with the blockade of Naboo, his homeworld that he represented as Senator Sheev Palpatine. The Sith Order, having survived its near destruction through Darth Bane's Rule of Two, conspired for generations to reclaim their place of dominance in the galaxy. By Sidious' time, the Sith secretly resided on Coruscant in spite of the Jedi Order's presence on the capital. The Jedi at the time were under the belief that their ancient rivals had been extinct for over a millennium.\n\nUnder the influence of the Sith, the Trade Federation blockaded and occupied the planet Naboo in 32 BBY, forcing its elected ruler, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, to flee to Coruscant seeking Senator Palpatine's counsel. Among the queen's retinue was Anakin Skywalker; a former slave from Tatooine, Skywalker was brought to the Jedi Temple by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who believed him to be the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force. In the Senate, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum was unable to respond to the Invasion of Naboo. Amidala, having learned from Palpatine about the corruption in the Republic government, called for stronger leadership by denouncing Valorum as a head of state. Consequently, Valorum was voted out of office and Palpatine was elected as the new Supreme Chancellor. During the early years of Palpatine's chancellery, he brought Skywalker to the lower levels of Coruscant, revealing corruption and the Republic's limitations to the young Jedi apprentice.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Overview[]\n\nLocated in the Coruscant subsector of the Corusca sector within the Core Worlds region, Coruscant was a planet covered in a dense ecumenopolis. The diameter of Coruscant was 12,240 kilometers; it orbited a small star, known as Coruscant Prime, in the Coruscant system. The distance between Coruscant and its star varied from 207 to 251 million kilometers, and as such, the planet did not have a climate that suited any one particular species. However, this was rectified by technology and the vast heat generated by the multi-level cityscape.\n\nCoruscant had four moons\u2014Centax-1, Centax-2, Centax-3, and Hesperidium. From space, Coruscant's luminosity was slightly dimmed by the planet's hazy cloud cover. The planet's weather patterns were affected by the troposphere-piercing buildings that covered the planet's surface. Inside the tallest buildings, enormous differences of temperature and air pressure from top to bottom produced unusual and unpredictable microclimates. As such, Coruscant had its own weather-control system. While this artificial climate was largely temperate in nature, parts of the planet occasionally experienced infrequent snowfalls.\n\nThousands of years of development destroyed the planet's ancient mountains and seas. Monument Plaza housed the top of Coruscant's last remaining mountain peak, that being the peak of the Umate. The tallest mountain of the Manarai range, many people decided to come to the surviving mountain top\u2014as it could be touched on Level 5,216\u2014to have a moment of reflection.\n\nBy around 232 BBY, a dark ring surrounded the peak's base as a result of the countless hands that had touched the rock. Generations of city planners decided to keep the mountain peak. During the High Republic Era, the surface around the peak was covered in greenery in an attempt to recreate the trees and other plants that would have been around the Umate's base many millennia earlier. Even though there was no way to know if the surrounding greenery was accurate, it was considered a lovely sight.\n\nSeveral of the Golan defense stations were located in a fixed-path orbit around the planet. During the Imperial Era, dozens of the Golan-II Defense Platforms and Golan III defense platforms were in orbit of Coruscant and other important Imperial Core Worlds for defense.\n\nSmall reptiles used as cues in a roulette game played on Coruscant evolved through mutations they experienced in the planet's gutters. Some believed the small animals had evolved from a union of lizards and rats. There were 24 hours in a Coruscant day, and 365 days in a Coruscant year. Owing to its importance in galactic history, the galaxy used a dating system standardized on Coruscant, and the planet's galactic coordinates were 0-0-0 despite it not being the exact geographical center of the galaxy.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - A capital at war[]\n\nThe Clone Wars began with the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, when the Separatist Crisis that began with the establishment of the Confederacy of Independent Systems escalated into open war between the Republic and the Separatists. In the same year, Amidala became the target of an assassination plot while she was on Coruscant opposing the Military Creation Act. The former queen-turned-senator was saved from the bounty hunters Zam Wesell and Jango Fett through the efforts of Kenobi and Skywalker. While Skywalker escorted Amidala to Naboo for her protection, Kenobi tracked Fett to the extragalactic world of Kamino where he discovered that an army of elite soldiers had been bred from Fett's genetic template. Kenobi followed Fett to Geonosis and learned that several commercial organizations pledged their resources to Count Dooku and the Separatist Droid Army.\n\nHaving learned of the Separatists' plan to attack the Republic, the Loyalist Committee gave serious consideration to using the Kaminoan clone troopers as the basis for the Republic Military. Though the Jedi Order had long stood as the Senate's instrument of peace in the galaxy, the limited number of Jedi Knights prevented them from fighting a galactic-scale conflict on their own. Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks, acting on behalf of Naboo in Amidala's absence, proposed a motion to grant emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. The Senate voted in favor of the Gungan politician's request, allowing Chancellor Palpatine to unilaterally create the Grand Army of the Republic.\n\nThe Clone Wars became one of the most turbulent times in galactic history and the first, full scale war in over a thousand years. As the capital of the Republic, Coruscant, already a hotbed of political intrigue, became a target for both military and political reasons. Situations and events that were unthinkable centuries before became commonplace. Even prior to the beginning of the war, changes could be seen in the Republic. The Senate, already corrupt and bloated found it difficult to respond, delegating emergency powers to Palpatine. The chancellor himself brought changes such as implementing the use of his personal Red Guards instead of the Senate Guards. During the Clone Wars, the Coruscant Guard was formed to serve as a clone security force for the Republic capital. Composed of elite clone shock troopers, the Coruscant Guard was led by Clone Commander Fox.\n\nAs the Grand Army and the Republic Navy spread across the galaxy to defend the Republic, the Jedi, long taking the stand of being peacekeepers instead of soldiers, led the clone troopers as commanders and generals. The dramatic changes were noted by the Jedi and the Republic citizens alike, specifically on Coruscant. Unknown to everyone except a select few, Coruscant was from where the entire war was continually manipulated by Palpatine. As Supreme Chancellor, he took overall charge of the Republic military and directed the war effort from his office in the Senate Office Building. As Darth Sidious he directed Dooku's actions designed to continue the war and further his plans.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine had the Zillo Beast from Malastare transported to Coruscant for scientific research, overruling the objections of his Jedi advisor Mace Windu. Palpatine ordered the Zillo Beast's destruction, but the creature broke out of the Republic Science and Technical Center and proceeded on a rampage across Coruscant's Senate district. The clone forces on Coruscant converged on the Zillo Beast, using poison gas to kill it while the Jedi protected the chancellor. The Senate hostage crisis was carried out by bounty hunter Cad Bane as part of a Hutt Clan plot to free Ziro Desilijic Tiure. While clone troopers had already started to see open use on Coruscant at that point, the failure of Senate Guards during the incident became a justification for the continued use of clones on the capital itself. In fact, clones came to replace Senate Commandos as Coruscant-based additional security and fast-action response military forces.\n\nThe Confederate\u2013Republic peace initiative was disrupted by the bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid by planetside Separatist agents. Consequently, the Senate voted to deregulate the banking industry, allowing the Republic to take on additional loans for the purpose of purchasing more clones for its army. Unbeknown to the Senate, the attack was supported by Senators Nix Card and Lott Dod, whose respective organizations, the InterGalactic Banking Clan and the Trade Federation, profited from the Clone Wars.\n\nPublic opinion towards the end of the war, as represented by the citizens of Coruscant, began to turn against the Jedi. Protesters would gather in front of the Temple, blaming the Jedi for the military losses and the Jedi's loss of perspective as keepers of the peace. It was at that time that an explosion occurred at the Jedi Temple docking complex that killed six Jedi and several clone troopers and Temple employees. The investigation by crime scene analysis droid Russo-ISC and Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano found that Letta Turmond, the wife of Temple employee Jackar Bowmani, had fed him volatile nano-droids which then exploded, killing Bowmani and causing the bombing at the Temple. Turmond was arrested and held at the Republic Center for Military Operations.\n\nTano was subsequently framed for the death of Turmond, who was killed by way of the Force. She escaped to the lower levels of Coruscant, becoming a hunted fugitive while seeking to prove her innocence. After the military recaptured Tano, the former Jedi was put on trial for treason against the Galactic Republic. However, the charges against her were dropped when the rogue Jedi Barriss Offee confessed to the crimes that Tano had been accused of. Though she remained on Coruscant, Tano left the Jedi Temple after deciding to not rejoin the Jedi Order.\n\n",

The area, however, was not as run down as other heavy industrial surface districts and contained relatively well-maintained streets, speeder lanes, and a shuttle bus route. On one of the main streets built on top of the urban blocks was an eatery called Dex's Diner. Owned and operated by Dexter Jettster, a Besalisk with a colorful background, it served mostly hard workers from the area. The diner offered home-style cooked meals and freshly brewed ardees. Jettster worked as the cook and employed two waitresses, Hermione Bagwa and her droid partner, WA-7. Shortly before the Clone Wars, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi came to Dex's Diner to see if his old friend Jettster could identify a poisoned dart. Jettster identified it as originating from the planet Kamino, which he knew of from his days as a prospector.\n\nDuring the civil war that erupted after the Emperor's death, CoCo Town became an epicenter of the fight between rebel and Imperial forces. The fighting saw the formation of the so-called Anklebiter Brigade, a group of youths familiar with the underground maintenance systems, who would use them to sneak behind Imperial lines and disrupt their abilities to fight.\n\n",

The heavy fortifications and benign front appealed to Palpatine, and towards the end of the Clone Wars, he began using the lower levels of the facility to store Sith artifacts and as a meditation area, access to which was prevented by the Red Guards.\n\nJedi General Shaak Ti and Doctor Nala Se escorted the Advanced Recon Commando CT-5555 \"Fives\" to the Grand Republic Medical Facility as part of their investigation into the actions of CT-5385, the clone trooper who prematurely executed Order 66. Chancellor Palpatine confronted Fives in the facility, revealing his true nature. Fives fought back against the Red Guards and escaped the facility, though he was eventually located and killed by the Coruscant Guard. After ending Fives' threat to Palpatine's plans, the Medical Facility was temporarily closed, and Palpatine used the opportunity to move several larger secret Sith artifacts into the tower from a building in the Works. However, the medical capabilities remained operational and were used to build the life-sustaining suit for Darth Vader after his fateful duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Sith artifacts inside the building fueled Vader's recovery and hate.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Inhabitants[]\n\nAlthough Coruscant was believed to be the homeworld of the human species, the Coruscanti were as varied as the galaxy itself, especially as one journeyed below the surface of the skyscrapers and into the underworld. Trillions of beings resided on the planet, and humans made up 68% percent of the population. According to Qui-Gon Jinn, there were people from a thousand worlds living on Coruscant. Th'er, the Priestess of Wood from Bri'n, disdained Coruscant's planet-wide urban sprawl as an \"abomination.\" Nevertheless, Jinn encouraged Th'er to take advantage of its diverse population, noting that there were many individuals on Coruscant whose worlds faced adversities similar to that of Bri'n.\n\nAs the center of galactic power, senators and delegates of every represented planet had a residence on Coruscant. From there they would spend their days either working in the Senate or hosting events such as parties and political meetings. Additionally, the planet served as the home of large communities of various species, some who rarely returned to their original homeworld. Many of those communities of species that were not human resided in the lower levels of the city. With the formation of the Empire, even the humans whose home planet had fallen out of favor with the Imperial government, such as Alderaan, were forced into enclaves in the underworld.\n\nOn the surface levels of Coruscant, skyscrapers served as homes and businesses for the wealthy, powerful, and politically connected. They were ferried by private speeder or an air taxi from one tower to the next or to the various theaters, clubs, operas, and other entertainment areas of Coruscant. Some journeyed to the surface street levels or Coruscant's surface parks to conduct clandestine meetings or to mingle in the crowds of people that streamed through the walkways of the residential and commercial areas. Among the rich and powerful of the planet were the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic and members of the Galactic Senate.\n\nThe influential and wealthy of Coruscant thrived in lavish lifestyles, attending meetings and social gatherings in highrise apartments, dining in fine restaurants overlooking the city, partying in the entertainment districts, and viewing large scale shows in theaters and operas. Even as the Republic decayed, the Clone Wars raged on, and the average citizen became disenfranchised, Coruscant's wealthy continued their lifestyle. The propaganda artist Janyor believed that this generation's lack of focus on galactic politics contributed to the decline and fall of the Republic.\n\nOne model of ship, the Coruscant Freighter, shared its name with Coruscant, where it was often used. On the streets of the city and in the shadows of skyscrapers teemed the planet's blue collar working population. Many lived in the various housing blocks of the surface structures in relative comfort though not nearly as extravagant as the planet's wealthy and powerful. Many worked on the upper and lower surface levels or enjoyed the entertainment and restaurants that were more catered to their financial abilities.\n\nBelow the housing blocks and surface levels was the population inhabiting the Coruscant underworld. A term used to describe both the thousands of levels underneath the surface, and, Coruscant's criminal population, the underworld was home to millions of the planet's population who were too poor to move upward or were hiding from the attentions of the authorities. The citizens who lived here rarely if ever during their lifetime saw the surface of the planet. Living between vast buildings and infrastructure that supported the surface, they carried on their lives at the mercy of the violence, decay, and constant threat of death. The Kubaz Glikkin hailed from the lower levels and eventually gained enough skill to be recognized as a Master Thief, yet Glikkin vowed to never forget his roots in Coruscant's underworld.\n\n",

During the development of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, George Lucas officially adopted the name Coruscant for the planet, a name that was created by Timothy Zahn for his June 1991 Legends novel Heir to the Empire. The planet first appeared in the 1994 Star Wars: Tie Fighter (video game), which showed scenes on Coruscant of the Imperial Palace, with its name first mentioned in The Phantom Menace. The prequel trilogy and the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film and television series showed Coruscant as a major center of activity and action. In Rogue One: A Star Wars Story the planet is briefly revisited via the dreams of Jyn Erso, featuring her childhood on Coruscant with her father, Galen Erso and Orson Krennic. Coruscant was a location in early versions of Star Wars: Episode IX\u2014both in Colin Trevorrow's Duel of the Fates script and in the early concept stages for what became The Rise of Skywalker; For the latter, it eventually evolved into Exegol.\n\n",

By the time following the Battle of Crait in 34 ABY, even the respectable areas of Coruscant were roamed by gangs. Gangs fought a bloody conflict for control of the glittering world's districts. Tourism to the once-galactic capital all but vanished, and, for an individual to be safe, they needed to afford protection like droids and armed guards. Accordingly, the city world was not a symbol of galactic possibilities. Instead, it represented the disturbing realities of the galaxy's current time period.\n\nThe pirate Hondo Ohnaka, who was saddened by Coruscant's current state, included the planet in his book titled Galactic Explorer's Guide.

Each senatorial delegation had their own hover platform, which they could detach from the walls of the chamber. They could then float it throughout the cavernous hall to be recognized by the Senate chair or to debate the issue at hand. In the center of the Senate chamber was the Chancellor's podium.

        "content": "# Coruscant - Showdown on Coruscant[]\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Palpatine had remained a popular leader, remaining in office at the will of the Senate for far longer than his term technically allowed. During this period, Palpatine continued to consolidate and centralize his own power. By 19 BBY, the third and final year of the war, Coruscant's defenses were spread thin. The Separatists had been pushed back to the Outer Rim Territories, and could not risk a direct strike at the heart of the Republic. Coruscanti citizens, used to having the war fought far from the capitol, were just as surprised as the Coruscant Home Defense Fleet when a Separatist assault force launched a surprise attack on the planet. During the Battle of Coruscant, Chancellor Palpatine was captured and taken to the Separatist flagship, the Invisible Hand, where he was rescued by the Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nAfter the death of Count Dooku, the Jedi on Coruscant focused their efforts on locating General Grievous, the Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies. Despite the Republic's success in the Outer Rim Sieges, relations were strained between the Jedi High Council and the Supreme Chancellor. Suspicious of the chancellor's motives, the High Council tasked Skywalker with spying on Palpatine after he had made the young Jedi Knight the Office of the Chancellor's representative on the Council. During the final days of the Clone Wars, Grand Master Yoda and the 41st Scout Battalion departed from Coruscant to defend the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. Shortly afterward, the High Council dispatched Kenobi and his 212th Attack Battalion to Utapau, the planet where Grievous had been located by Clone Intelligence.\n\nWith the Clone Wars nearing its conclusion, Chancellor Palpatine revealed his secret identity as the Dark Lord of the Sith to Skywalker. Acting on Skywalker's report, Jedi Masters Mace Windu, Kit Fisto, Saesee Tiin, and Agen Kolar tried to arrest Sidious. The ensuing lightsaber duel resulted in the deaths of Kolar, Tiin, and Fisto; although Sidious was disarmed by Windu, he succeeded in killing the Jedi Order's champion due to the interference of Skywalker, who believed the chancellor's claims of possessing the power to save others from death. As a consequence, Skywalker renounced the Jedi and assumed the mantle of a Sith as Darth Vader.\n\n",

The Jedi Temple and its surrounding serene complex became the home of the new Emperor. While the spires of the Temple remained in place, the rest of the structure was heavily remodeled and expanded with sloping facades and block-shaped additions. The entire area was known as the Federal District, with the Imperial Palace forming one point of the so-called supreme triangle. The other two points were the byzantine COMPNOR arcology, which contained the headquarters of the Imperial Security Bureau, and the new Naval Intelligence Agency headquarters, a near-windowless complex which formerly housed the Republic's strategic center. The cityscape of Coruscant changed as well. Buildings were stripped of their elegant Republic dressings in favor of sleek lines and block-like surfaces, and many smaller buildings became engulfed into larger buildings. Some areas changed so quickly that they were not recognizable to those who had seen them only a few years before.\n\nThe Empire's policies against non-humans and its tightening control of the population caused unrest, especially among the alien populations of the underworld. The Empire's way of acting caused the movement in the streets to decrease, as the planet's population tried to avoid the Imperial authorities to avoid problems. The Krrupt Gang kept hold of territory on Level 3726, where they worked to keep even the Empire away. In 9 BBY, the Stinger Mantis crew, led by Jedi Knight Cal Kestis, stole Imperial military information from Imperial Senator Daho Sejan on Coruscant. A large part of Kestis' team died in the confrontation, in addition to Sejan, who was killed by the Inquisitor known as the Ninth Sister for supposed betrayal. The Ninth Sister was also killed when Kestis decapitated her. The acquired information was handed over to the Partisans. As the Galactic Civil War took shape, the Empire began moving its Mon Calamari population on Coruscant. The aggressiveness of the forced relocations caused rioting to erupt in the Old Market Sector, which was brutally put down by Imperial forces.\n\nAfter the destruction of the planet Alderaan by the Death Star, rumors of what occurred began reaching the Alderaanian population on Coruscant, most of whom lived on Level 3204. Vigils soon became heated and angry when it became known that the Empire had destroyed the planet. For several days, rioting continued until the combined efforts of the Coruscant Security Force and Imperial stormtroopers restored order by firing indiscriminately into the crowds. The crowds, frightened, quickly dispersed. The following day, the Coruscant police arrested anyone caught out in the streets. The day after that, stormtroopers began going door to door stating that Rebel spies had recruited local residents and that Alderaanians had to be taken in for questioning.\n\n",

With both the Emperor and his apprentice dead, due to being killed during the destruction of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, the citizens of Coruscant rejoiced, pulling down statues of Palpatine, overwhelming the stormtroopers on the streets, and setting off chimes and fireworks. Police forces on speeders quickly entered the plaza and opened fire on the crowds without warning, killing many who were present. Present Coruscanti erupted into full-scale rioting. Blaster fire and fighting soon erupted across the capital between Coruscanti and the Imperial security forces.\n\nIn the ensuing months the New Republic was formed and re-established the Galactic Senate on Chandrila. Meanwhile, Coruscant dissolved into a true state of civil war, with some sectors entrenching themselves with Rebel resistance fighters, while other sectors actively fought against their neighbors and supported the Imperial forces. As the Empire fractured all over the galaxy, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda took control of Imperial forces on Coruscant and the Coruscanti government. However, the Imperial Navy withdrew support from the throneworld as Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax refused to allow Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, the figurehead of the Navy, to send reinforcements to the planet. Rax, leader of the Shadow Council that secretly guided the Empire in its final days, saw the planet as representing the \"decay\" that caused the Empire's downfall.\n\nIn this vacuum, the Imperial Security Bureau was left to coordinate Coruscant's Imperial forces. Grand Vizier Mas Amedda remained the planet's administrator and de-facto head of the Empire, but held no real power. The ISB established a nominal blockade around the planet utilizing ISB spaceships and coordinated the efforts of present security forces and stormtroopers. The Verity and Federal District were heavily fortified with checkpoints and barricades. Coruscant skylanes were diverted, and ISB crafts flew on patrol. Smoke rose from damaged vehicles and buildings as a fierce guerrilla war consumed the entire planet. Amedda, in despair and desperation, sought to turn himself over to New Republic Chancellor Mon Mothma and Princess Leia Organa. However, they refused to take him prisoner, instead insisting that he find a way to capitulate the Empire and sign a full surrender.\n\n",

An order of Force-sensitives, the Jedi Knights served the Republic for thousands of years as keepers of the peace. Their home was the Jedi Temple. Built on a plain of low lying urban blocks, the Jedi Temple was easily recognizable on the Coruscant cityscape with its distinctive five spires. Part school and part monastery, the Temple was the hub of all Jedi activity throughout the galaxy. In one of the spires sat the Jedi High Council, led by the Grand Master of the Order, which directed the actions of the Jedi and served as advisers to the Senate and Chancellor.\n\nThe Temple held a large lobby and chambers with statues of famous Jedi and also contained numerous facilities including hanger bays for starships and speeders utilized by the Jedi, sleeping and living quarters, rooms for meetings and instruction, a medical facility, prison cells, and communications and security stations. The Temple also held the famous Jedi Archives, which stored the largest collection of information on the galaxy as well as a vault containing the valuable holocrons containing the Order's Force knowledge and secrets.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Jedi, serving as generals and commanders of the Grand Army, coordinated their efforts from the Temple. However, as the war began to conclude, the Jedi became more separated from the hierarchy of the military command and establishment. When Palpatine was revealed as the Sith Lord the Jedi had been searching for, he ordered the execution of Order 66 and sent his new apprentice Darth Vader to the Jedi Temple. Entering with the 501st Legion, Vader and the clone troopers seized the Temple, killing all the Jedi and younglings inside and setting the monastery ablaze. Later, Masters Yoda and Kenobi infiltrated the Temple to discover what had occurred. It was there they reconfigured a distress signal transmitting from the Temple to any surviving Jedi asking them to return (into a Sith trap), and learned the truth of Skywalker's fall and Palpatine's identity as the Dark Lord of the Sith.\n\nAfter the war, Palpatine turned the Temple into the Imperial Palace, using it as his new home. The Temple's spires remained intact though the rest of the Temple was heavily remodeled and expanded. The hallways were stripped of all statues and Republic-era ornaments. Where they had once been quiet and solemn, they became filled with busy government workers and functionaries. A large landing courtyard allowed for shuttles and starships to land. The entire Palace complex was watched over by the red-robed Imperial Royal Guard. The center spire was converted into the Emperor's throne room with a ten-meter tall podium in the center accessible by the Emperor from his residence via a private turbolift. The structure remained standing on Coruscant throughout the Emperor's reign.\n\n",

The executive building had docking bays that wrapped around the building, allowing Senators to land their private shuttles and walk inside. The building contained mostly offices and meeting rooms for members of the Senate but also held the offices used on a day-to-day basis by the Supreme Chancellor. During Palpatine's term, the Chancellor's office was decorated with red floors and walls as well as several statues. A lobby led to the Chancellor's public office, which contained a grand desk and large window that overlooked the cityscape. To the side, another hallway led to Palpatine's inner private office. The Senate Office Building became known as the Imperial Executive Building after the Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Empire.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - A new status[]\n\nWith the Galactic Civil War concluded, the New Republic sought to reshape galactic politics in an effort to both prevent the abuses of the Old Republic and bring in disaffected worlds that had seceded from the Republic prior to the Clone Wars. To accomplish this, the restored Galactic Senate decided that all worlds would have an equal say in their government, and as such all worlds had an equal chance of hosting the legislative branch on a rotating basis, rather than simply remaining on Coruscant alone. The New Republic would eventually move some government operations back to Coruscant as the planet was already designed to handle and administer the galaxy's infrastructure, transforming Coruscant into a key administrative hub for the young government.\n\nIndeed, Coruscant remained a populous world, home to a trillion permanent residents, and was still referred to as \"the center of the galaxy\" during the New Republic Era. The New Republic Defense Force maintained a presence on Coruscant, providing security and structure, while overseeing the decommission of warships from both the Imperial Navy and the Alliance Fleet. Inoperable Imperial-class Star Destroyers were disposed in salvage yards such as the Shipyard Depot on Coruscant.\n\nAfter the Galactic Empire's defeat, captured Imperials were granted the chance to join the New Republic. As a result, programs like the Re-Integration Institute and the New Republic Amnesty Program were created to facilitate a former Imperial's assimilation into the new regime. The Amnesty Program consisted of former Imperial officers and scientists who, after spending time in the Re-Integration Institute, received accommodations in Amnesty Housing on Coruscant. Amnesty Scientist L52 was assigned to work in a New Republic skyscraper where Imperial technology was archived and destroyed. Amnesty Officer G68 worked in the same building as Colonel Tuttle from Requisitions. L52 was arrested by New Republic soldiers around 9 ABY, having left the program's designated perimeter to acquire equipment in the hope of continuing his cloning research, despite its prohibition by the Coruscant Accords.\n\n",

However, centuries prior to the Clone Wars, increasingly high cost on Coruscant prompted most manufacturers to shift their operations to off-planet facilities. Afterwards, the Works mainly consisted of long-abandoned buildings and empty warehouses, many of which were appropriated by criminals, with large areas rendered uninhabitable by toxic waste. Because of this, a derelict hangar in the neglected industrial zone was the site of clandestine meetings between Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus during the Clone Wars.\n\n",

        "content": "# Coruscant - Government[]\n\nCoruscant, as the center of the galaxy, thrived on the rule of government. It served as the capital of the Republic which kept the peace and prevented a major war in the galaxy for over a thousand years. Under the Republic, the Chancellor and the Senate had a direct influence on the planet's governance. Major events that affected the Republic equally affected Coruscant. In its last years, the Republic's Senate became corrupt, bloated, and ultimately ineffectual, though some continued to fight in the belief of its ability to govern.\n\nWith the formation of the Empire, the Senate transitioned into a limited role, providing council and legislation but ultimately at the power of the Emperor. As Coruscant's government services were strained, the Imperial Senate moved to have each senator open citizen assistance offices that would supplement the work of the local government. While the goal was to primarily assist the members of each senator's homeworld living on Coruscant, the assistance offices were open to help all Coruscanti.\n\nAt the height of his power, Palpatine disbanded the Senate altogether and gave what little power they had left to the regional governors. At the end of the Galactic Civil War, the New Republic installed a provisional government over Coruscant led by the former Imperial Grand Vizier Mas Amedda. However, the New Republic did not establish its government on Coruscant, choosing instead to rotate the capital among the various member worlds. Under the New Republic, Coruscant was represented by a senator and junior senator, but the planet had come under the control of crime syndicates.\n\nEpidemic outbreaks at the starports of Coruscant were controlled by the Coruscant Health Office. Coruscant was policed by the Coruscant Security Force, which utilized police droids on the upper levels together with sentient officers and detectives, and the burly underworld police who patrolled in the cutthroat environment of the lower levels. The Coruscant Ministry of Ingress handled the flow of immigration to and from the planet, and the Galactic Republic Customs of Coruscant office monitored cargo transports.\n\nThe Senate had its own protectors, the Senate Guard. Serving under a long tradition, the Senate Guard was a reminder that though the Republic did not have a standing army, it was not defenseless. As the Clone Wars erupted, the clone troopers of the Coruscant Guard worked as peacekeepers and military police, providing a constant reminder of the expanded power of the government, specifically Palpatine. With the formation of the Empire, the Coruscant Guard and Imperial stormtroopers took over the functions of the Senate Guard, with stormtroopers directly responsible for security on the planet, alongside the civilian Coruscant police.\n\n",

Home to a thriving community of sellers and industrialists, the sector housed dozens of shops and even a meat packing plant. Yet, there was also many impoverished citizens and desperate people who lived on this level. By the Imperial Era, the economy of the area had started to decline, even with the Empire's ruthless crackdown on crime. The increased oppression and protection racketeering from troopers hurt many of the businesses there, and corrupt politicians, such as Senator Daho Sejan, would use the level as a way of increasing the financial power. This level also featured at least one Desi's Noodles, a common food chain of popular fast food stores that were located in the Coruscant Underworld. Eating there was considered a must for travelers to the planet. Many stormtroopers frequented the locations for their famous dishes.\n\n",
