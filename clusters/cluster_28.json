Galaxy's Edge has been featured in three episodes of Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures: \"Millennium Falcon - Smugglers Run,\" \"Black Spire Outpost,\" \"Rise of the Resistance.\" A Galaxy's Edge-themed content pack was released for The Sims in September 2020. The Art of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge was released in Spring 2021. A Hasbro toy line was produced. A LEGO set of the Intersystem Transport Ship was also released; A special code will allow you to use the ship in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.\n\nOriginally, certain merchandise was meant to be sold exclusively inside Galaxy's Edge. However, due to a drop in attendance as a result of park closures and travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Disney parks began releasing Galaxy's Edge merchandise outside of the land itself. A variety of merchandise became available at Target stores beginning August 30, 2020. That September, merchandise also became available at Disneyland's WonderGround Gallery and at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom Emporium, as well as online and internationally via shopDisney.com.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Opening \u2021[]\n\nGalaxy's Edge received extensive press coverage in February 2019, after select journalists were given a tour of the Disneyland version. During this time, the cast members' costumes were unveiled. On April 13, Galaxy's Edge featured in a panel at Celebration Chicago. During the panel, Mark Hamill appeared via pre-recorded video to announce a Twitter sweepstakes to win a trip to the attraction.\n\nThe land opened on May 31, 2019 at Disneyland. This followed opening ceremonies on May 29, in which Disney CEO Bob Iger was accompanied by George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Billy Dee Williams, with Ford dedicating Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run to the late Peter Mayhew. Initial attendance fell significantly below expectations, which Iger attributed to an increase of ticket and hotel prices, a fear of overcrowding, and the fact that Rise of the Resistance had yet to open. Senior EVP and CFO Christine McCarthy also cited lower passholders attendance due to crowd control policies. Several Galaxy's Edge-themed panels were held at Disney's D23 Expo on August 23. The land opened on August 29, 2019 at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World. As before, there was an opening ceremony on the previous day.\n\nFrom September 24-30, a plethora of Galaxy's Edge tie-ins aired on Disney's TV programming on ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, and ESPN\u2014including the two-hour special Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge \u2013 Adventure Awaits on September 29. On November 28, ABC's Magical Holiday Celebration included Portugal. The Man performing at Galaxy's Edge\u2014the first musical act to perform at the land. The land was later covered in episodes of Disney+'s The Imagineering Story and One Day At Disney.\n\nRise of the Resistance opened on December 5, 2019 at Walt Disney World, accompanied by another press tour. It opened on January 17, 2020 at Disneyland. A smaller version of Galaxy's Edge will also open sometime after 2021 at Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris Resort. However, as of August 2022, this is now uncertain following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn May 27, 2022, it was revealed that characters from different timelines will appear as well, such as Boba Fett and Fennec Shand. Characters from different stories and timelines won't intersect with other characters or stories that would not be appropriate for them in their given timeline.\n\nOn July 27, 2022, the Batuu Bounty Hunters game debuted at Walt Disney World. Using the newly introduced MagicBand+ and the Datapad app, guests take jobs locating bounties for the Bounty Hunters' Guild and Batuu's guildmaster Raga Bua.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Layout[]\n\nGalaxy's Edge is set on Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, a planet on the edge of the Outer Rim Territories (just before Wild Space). The time period is between the events of The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. It was designed to feel like a real world, blending seamlessly into the park and having no obvious ride markers. Guests encounter three types of cast members: First Order, Resistance and villagers. Visitors are able to use an app called Star Wars: Datapad to aid in navigating the land; features include \"hacking\" (to interact with door panels or droids), \"scanning\" (to inspect cargo), \"translation\" (to decode all the Aurebesh signs throughout the attraction), \"tuning\" (to listen in to secret communications), and \"Outpost Control\" (a game in which visitors choose First Order or Resistance).\n\nThe park features two attractions: Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run (which puts guests behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon) and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance (which throws guests into the middle of a battle between the First Order and the Resistance). The official names for the attractions were announced November 17, 2018 at the Destination D event. The Target-exclusive Blu-ray for Solo: A Star Wars Story includes a featurette called \"The Millennium Falcon: From Page to Park,\" which details how the Millennium Falcon ride was developed for Galaxy's Edge.\n\nOga's Cantina is a small dining establishment that serves Star Wars\u2013themed food and drink. Coca-Cola products are available at the attraction, with special in-universe Aurebesh designs. Various shops throughout Galaxy's Edge sell in-universe items; in developing these vendors, Disney Imagineers visited Istanbul and Morocco, and looked at old concept art from the Lucasfilm Archives. Visitors can choose to build their own lightsabers at Savi's Workshop, with the option to either make custom lightsabers or choose pre-established designs.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Development[]\n\nIn total, Galaxy's Edge took over six years from concept to final unveiling. Disney CEO Robert Iger first announced it at the D23 Expo on August 15, 2015, stating that the company would be building a Star Wars\u2013themed land in Disneyland Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and in Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The announcement stated that these lands would be fourteen acres, making them the largest single-land expansions in the company's history. During the Q1 FY17 Earnings call for The Walt Disney Company on February 7, 2017, Iger announced that the new lands would open in the year 2019.\n\nAccording to J. Daniel Jenkins, a former Disney Imagineer who helped design Galaxy's Edge, an early concept for the park would have set it in select locations from Episodes I\u2013VI. This evolved into the original planet Batuu once Iger viewed the first footage from The Force Awakens and became confident in the prospects of the sequel trilogy. Fellow Imagineer Scott Trowbridge explained the reasoning: \"The answer really is we know those places and we know those stories that happen there and we know that we're not in them. Black Spire Outpost is an opportunity that's designed from the very get go to be a place that invites exploration and discovery. A place that invites us to become a character in the world of Star Wars. And to the extent that we want to, to participate in the stories of Star Wars.\" At one point, the Imagineers also considered building two entirely different Star Wars lands instead of two of the same concept.\n\nDuring the \"Star Wars and Disney Parks: A Galaxy in the Making\" panel at Celebration Orlando, Imagineer Asa Kalama stated that what they were building would be canonical. It was later revealed to take place after The Last Jedi through promotional material for the book series Flight of the Falcon. During development, the attraction had as many as 1,100 Disney employees working on the project. By early 2019, this had dropped to 600.\n\nIn the lead-up to the annual D23 Expo, the Disney Parks Blog unveiled a logo for the event \"Walt Disney Parks and Resorts: A Galaxy of Stories,\" which would debut on July 14\u201316. The event gave guests a glimpse of the locations, starships, creatures, and droids that would populate the outpost that would act as a setting for the park, and unveiled a detailed model for the 14-acre theme park that would debut in 2019, alongside artwork and media showcasing its development. On December 16, 2017, during the parks' Galactic Nights event, more information about the ride and its development process was unveiled to the public via Lucasfilm vice president Doug Chiang as well as Imagineers Chris Beatty, Robin Reardon, and Scott Trowbridge. In particular, it was revealed via construction photos that development had recently \"topped out\" after the highest construction point was in place. It was also revealed that, among other things, there would be a toy shop with concept art unveiled, with Beatty explaining that the inspiration for its design was from marketplaces in Morocco, and that, fitting with its design inspiration, all the wares are handmade arts and crafts similar to those found in Moroccan marketplaces. In addition, the water fountains would have a unique design. (He later revealed that the overall look of the park was inspired by Petrified Forest National Park.) Much of the production work was handled by the same Pinewood Studios artists who worked on the films.\n\nChiang also revealed that they were building X-wing models for the theme park and differentiated them from the movie models. Some concept art also showcased the Millennium Falcon portion of the attraction, including an entirely new location composed of overgrowth in a sewer-like area. A set of trading cards were also unveiled to the public, which revealed some new details about the ride, in particular confirming that BB-8 and Kylo Ren would be present in the ride, as well as hinting at a droid character called \"R3X\" that was later revealed to be RX-24 from the original Star Tours ride. The same cards also had map pieces that revealed some locations on Batuu, in particular the Surabat River Valley, Docking Bay 9, Merchant Row, and Black Spire Station, would be present in the ride and gave some details about the location and a translation key for an Aurebesh poem on the borders of some cards. Some of the props designed for the land were subsequently used in other Star Wars media, including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and The Mandalorian,",

        "content": "# Black Spire Outpost - Behind the scenes[]\n\nAt the D23 Expo on August 15, 2015, The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger first announced that the company would be building a Star Wars-themed land in Disneyland Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and in Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The announcement stated that these lands would be fourteen acres in size, making them the largest single land expansions in company history. The two attractions announced for the land included a ride that puts guests behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon and a ride that throws guests into the middle of a battle between the First Order and the Resistance. it was also announced that the lands' setting would be on a yet-to-be-seen planet on the edge of the Outer Rim Territories, just before Wild Space. During the Q1 FY17 Earnings call for The Walt Disney Company on February 7, 2017, Iger announced that the new lands would open in the year 2019. During the \"Star Wars and Disney Parks: A Galaxy in the Making\" panel at Celebration Orlando, Asa Kalama of Walt Disney Imagineering stated that what they were building would be canonical.\n\nDuring Galactic Nights, a set of promotional trading cards were issued that hinted at what would be found at the attraction regarding Black Spire Outpost. The front of the cards depicted certain scenes of what was likely to occur, such as an encounter with Kylo Ren, bargaining with Dok-Ondar, and Hondo and Chewbacca agreeing to a deal, among others. The back of each card depicted part of a nine-panel map depicting the various locales of the outpost as well as some details about the specific locations. Eight of the cards had a phrase in Aurebesh describing the location which, thanks to Twitter user Nick Tierce, was revealed to say in full \"At the edge of the galaxy so far away, black was the spire that called me to stay, a beacon for drifters forgotten and lost, the spire summoned those broken and tossed, come stay here forever or just pass on through, the spirit of the black spire will forever change you\".\n\n",

Most features will only work when the user is within Black Spire Outpost. The game was first released as part of a May 24th, 2019 update to the Disneyland section of the app, days prior to the opening of that park's Galaxy's Edge area on May 31st.\n\nFeatures of Datapad include \"hacking\" (to interact with door panels or droids), \"scanning\" (to inspect cargo), \"translation\" (to decode all the Aurebesh signs throughout Galaxy's Edge), \"tuning\" (to listen into secret communications), and \"Outpost Control\" (a game in which visitors choose First Order or Resistance). As users play and explore they will unlock a variety of outfits, equipment, star maps, schematics, droid data, transmissions, and titles. They can also earn credits by completing jobs and gain reputation with the First Order, Resistance, and \"scoundrel\" factions.\n\nA variation of the Datapad app for guests of the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel experience was later released, also a part of Play Disney. The Datapad also works in conjunction with the MagicBand+ based \"Star Wars: Batuu Bounty Hunters\" interactive experience exclusive to the Disney's Hollywood Studios version of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge where the scanner will reveal your quarry.\n\n",

Galaxy's Edge has been featured in three episodes of Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures: \"Millennium Falcon - Smugglers Run,\" \"Black Spire Outpost,\" \"Rise of the Resistance.\" A Galaxy's Edge-themed content pack was released for The Sims in September 2020. The Art of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge was released in Spring 2021. A Hasbro toy line was produced. A LEGO set of the Intersystem Transport Ship was also released; A special code will allow you to use the ship in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.\n\nOriginally, certain merchandise was meant to be sold exclusively inside Galaxy's Edge. However, due to a drop in attendance as a result of park closures and travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Disney parks began releasing Galaxy's Edge merchandise outside of the land itself. A variety of merchandise became available at Target stores beginning August 30, 2020. That September, merchandise also became available at Disneyland's WonderGround Gallery and at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom Emporium, as well as online and internationally via shopDisney.com.\n\n",

The rogues, smugglers, and adventurers who eke out a living on the largest settlement on the planet, Black Spire Outpost, are here to avoid prying eyes and unnecessary complications. Vi, a Resistance spy on the run from the First Order, is hardly a welcome guest. And when a shuttle full of stormtroopers lands in her wake, determined to root her out, she has no idea where to find help.\n\nTo survive, Vi will have to seek out the good-hearted heroes hiding in a world that redefines scum and villainy.

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Development[]\n\nIn total, Galaxy's Edge took over six years from concept to final unveiling. Disney CEO Robert Iger first announced it at the D23 Expo on August 15, 2015, stating that the company would be building a Star Wars\u2013themed land in Disneyland Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and in Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The announcement stated that these lands would be fourteen acres, making them the largest single-land expansions in the company's history. During the Q1 FY17 Earnings call for The Walt Disney Company on February 7, 2017, Iger announced that the new lands would open in the year 2019.\n\nAccording to J. Daniel Jenkins, a former Disney Imagineer who helped design Galaxy's Edge, an early concept for the park would have set it in select locations from Episodes I\u2013VI. This evolved into the original planet Batuu once Iger viewed the first footage from The Force Awakens and became confident in the prospects of the sequel trilogy. Fellow Imagineer Scott Trowbridge explained the reasoning: \"The answer really is we know those places and we know those stories that happen there and we know that we're not in them. Black Spire Outpost is an opportunity that's designed from the very get go to be a place that invites exploration and discovery. A place that invites us to become a character in the world of Star Wars. And to the extent that we want to, to participate in the stories of Star Wars.\" At one point, the Imagineers also considered building two entirely different Star Wars lands instead of two of the same concept.\n\nDuring the \"Star Wars and Disney Parks: A Galaxy in the Making\" panel at Celebration Orlando, Imagineer Asa Kalama stated that what they were building would be canonical. It was later revealed to take place after The Last Jedi through promotional material for the book series Flight of the Falcon. During development, the attraction had as many as 1,100 Disney employees working on the project. By early 2019, this had dropped to 600.\n\nIn the lead-up to the annual D23 Expo, the Disney Parks Blog unveiled a logo for the event \"Walt Disney Parks and Resorts: A Galaxy of Stories,\" which would debut on July 14\u201316. The event gave guests a glimpse of the locations, starships, creatures, and droids that would populate the outpost that would act as a setting for the park, and unveiled a detailed model for the 14-acre theme park that would debut in 2019, alongside artwork and media showcasing its development. On December 16, 2017, during the parks' Galactic Nights event, more information about the ride and its development process was unveiled to the public via Lucasfilm vice president Doug Chiang as well as Imagineers Chris Beatty, Robin Reardon, and Scott Trowbridge. In particular, it was revealed via construction photos that development had recently \"topped out\" after the highest construction point was in place. It was also revealed that, among other things, there would be a toy shop with concept art unveiled, with Beatty explaining that the inspiration for its design was from marketplaces in Morocco, and that, fitting with its design inspiration, all the wares are handmade arts and crafts similar to those found in Moroccan marketplaces. In addition, the water fountains would have a unique design. (He later revealed that the overall look of the park was inspired by Petrified Forest National Park.) Much of the production work was handled by the same Pinewood Studios artists who worked on the films.\n\nChiang also revealed that they were building X-wing models for the theme park and differentiated them from the movie models. Some concept art also showcased the Millennium Falcon portion of the attraction, including an entirely new location composed of overgrowth in a sewer-like area. A set of trading cards were also unveiled to the public, which revealed some new details about the ride, in particular confirming that BB-8 and Kylo Ren would be present in the ride, as well as hinting at a droid character called \"R3X\" that was later revealed to be RX-24 from the original Star Tours ride. The same cards also had map pieces that revealed some locations on Batuu, in particular the Surabat River Valley, Docking Bay 9, Merchant Row, and Black Spire Station, would be present in the ride and gave some details about the location and a translation key for an Aurebesh poem on the borders of some cards. Some of the props designed for the land were subsequently used in other Star Wars media, including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and The Mandalorian,\n\nOn January 11, 2018, the Star Wars Launch Bay attraction at Disneyland included a piece of the full model of the upcoming attraction that was unveiled at D23, marking it the second Disney theme park to include part of the scale model, the first being Disney's Hollywood Studios. A short preview video was released on May 22. On May 24, 2019 the Disneyland website and mobile app updated park maps to include, and confirm, the layout of Galaxy's Edge. The Disney Parks Blog revealed new park guide books including the new land.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Layout[]\n\nGalaxy's Edge is set on Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, a planet on the edge of the Outer Rim Territories (just before Wild Space). The time period is between the events of The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. It was designed to feel like a real world, blending seamlessly into the park and having no obvious ride markers. Guests encounter three types of cast members: First Order, Resistance and villagers. Visitors are able to use an app called Star Wars: Datapad to aid in navigating the land; features include \"hacking\" (to interact with door panels or droids), \"scanning\" (to inspect cargo), \"translation\" (to decode all the Aurebesh signs throughout the attraction), \"tuning\" (to listen in to secret communications), and \"Outpost Control\" (a game in which visitors choose First Order or Resistance).\n\nThe park features two attractions: Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run (which puts guests behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon) and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance (which throws guests into the middle of a battle between the First Order and the Resistance). The official names for the attractions were announced November 17, 2018 at the Destination D event. The Target-exclusive Blu-ray for Solo: A Star Wars Story includes a featurette called \"The Millennium Falcon: From Page to Park,\" which details how the Millennium Falcon ride was developed for Galaxy's Edge.\n\nOga's Cantina is a small dining establishment that serves Star Wars\u2013themed food and drink. Coca-Cola products are available at the attraction, with special in-universe Aurebesh designs. Various shops throughout Galaxy's Edge sell in-universe items; in developing these vendors, Disney Imagineers visited Istanbul and Morocco, and looked at old concept art from the Lucasfilm Archives. Visitors can choose to build their own lightsabers at Savi's Workshop, with the option to either make custom lightsabers or choose pre-established designs.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Opening \u2021[]\n\nGalaxy's Edge received extensive press coverage in February 2019, after select journalists were given a tour of the Disneyland version. During this time, the cast members' costumes were unveiled. On April 13, Galaxy's Edge featured in a panel at Celebration Chicago. During the panel, Mark Hamill appeared via pre-recorded video to announce a Twitter sweepstakes to win a trip to the attraction.\n\nThe land opened on May 31, 2019 at Disneyland. This followed opening ceremonies on May 29, in which Disney CEO Bob Iger was accompanied by George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Billy Dee Williams, with Ford dedicating Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run to the late Peter Mayhew. Initial attendance fell significantly below expectations, which Iger attributed to an increase of ticket and hotel prices, a fear of overcrowding, and the fact that Rise of the Resistance had yet to open. Senior EVP and CFO Christine McCarthy also cited lower passholders attendance due to crowd control policies. Several Galaxy's Edge-themed panels were held at Disney's D23 Expo on August 23. The land opened on August 29, 2019 at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World. As before, there was an opening ceremony on the previous day.\n\nFrom September 24-30, a plethora of Galaxy's Edge tie-ins aired on Disney's TV programming on ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, and ESPN\u2014including the two-hour special Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge \u2013 Adventure Awaits on September 29. On November 28, ABC's Magical Holiday Celebration included Portugal. The Man performing at Galaxy's Edge\u2014the first musical act to perform at the land. The land was later covered in episodes of Disney+'s The Imagineering Story and One Day At Disney.\n\nRise of the Resistance opened on December 5, 2019 at Walt Disney World, accompanied by another press tour. It opened on January 17, 2020 at Disneyland. A smaller version of Galaxy's Edge will also open sometime after 2021 at Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris Resort. However, as of August 2022, this is now uncertain following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn May 27, 2022, it was revealed that characters from different timelines will appear as well, such as Boba Fett and Fennec Shand. Characters from different stories and timelines won't intersect with other characters or stories that would not be appropriate for them in their given timeline.\n\nOn July 27, 2022, the Batuu Bounty Hunters game debuted at Walt Disney World. Using the newly introduced MagicBand+ and the Datapad app, guests take jobs locating bounties for the Bounty Hunters' Guild and Batuu's guildmaster Raga Bua.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Development[]\n\nIn total, Galaxy's Edge took over six years from concept to final unveiling. Disney CEO Robert Iger first announced it at the D23 Expo on August 15, 2015, stating that the company would be building a Star Wars\u2013themed land in Disneyland Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and in Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The announcement stated that these lands would be fourteen acres, making them the largest single-land expansions in the company's history. During the Q1 FY17 Earnings call for The Walt Disney Company on February 7, 2017, Iger announced that the new lands would open in the year 2019.\n\nAccording to J. Daniel Jenkins, a former Disney Imagineer who helped design Galaxy's Edge, an early concept for the park would have set it in select locations from Episodes I\u2013VI. This evolved into the original planet Batuu once Iger viewed the first footage from The Force Awakens and became confident in the prospects of the sequel trilogy. Fellow Imagineer Scott Trowbridge explained the reasoning: \"The answer really is we know those places and we know those stories that happen there and we know that we're not in them. Black Spire Outpost is an opportunity that's designed from the very get go to be a place that invites exploration and discovery. A place that invites us to become a character in the world of Star Wars. And to the extent that we want to, to participate in the stories of Star Wars.\" At one point, the Imagineers also considered building two entirely different Star Wars lands instead of two of the same concept.\n\nDuring the \"Star Wars and Disney Parks: A Galaxy in the Making\" panel at Celebration Orlando, Imagineer Asa Kalama stated that what they were building would be canonical. It was later revealed to take place after The Last Jedi through promotional material for the book series Flight of the Falcon. During development, the attraction had as many as 1,100 Disney employees working on the project. By early 2019, this had dropped to 600.\n\nIn the lead-up to the annual D23 Expo, the Disney Parks Blog unveiled a logo for the event \"Walt Disney Parks and Resorts: A Galaxy of Stories,\" which would debut on July 14\u201316. The event gave guests a glimpse of the locations, starships, creatures, and droids that would populate the outpost that would act as a setting for the park, and unveiled a detailed model for the 14-acre theme park that would debut in 2019, alongside artwork and media showcasing its development. On December 16, 2017, during the parks' Galactic Nights event, more information about the ride and its development process was unveiled to the public via Lucasfilm vice president Doug Chiang as well as Imagineers Chris Beatty, Robin Reardon, and Scott Trowbridge. In particular, it was revealed via construction photos that development had recently \"topped out\" after the highest construction point was in place. It was also revealed that, among other things, there would be a toy shop with concept art unveiled, with Beatty explaining that the inspiration for its design was from marketplaces in Morocco, and that, fitting with its design inspiration, all the wares are handmade arts and crafts similar to those found in Moroccan marketplaces. In addition, the water fountains would have a unique design. (He later revealed that the overall look of the park was inspired by Petrified Forest National Park.) Much of the production work was handled by the same Pinewood Studios artists who worked on the films.\n\nChiang also revealed that they were building X-wing models for the theme park and differentiated them from the movie models. Some concept art also showcased the Millennium Falcon portion of the attraction, including an entirely new location composed of overgrowth in a sewer-like area. A set of trading cards were also unveiled to the public, which revealed some new details about the ride, in particular confirming that BB-8 and Kylo Ren would be present in the ride, as well as hinting at a droid character called \"R3X\" that was later revealed to be RX-24 from the original Star Tours ride. The same cards also had map pieces that revealed some locations on Batuu, in particular the Surabat River Valley, Docking Bay 9, Merchant Row, and Black Spire Station, would be present in the ride and gave some details about the location and a translation key for an Aurebesh poem on the borders of some cards. Some of the props designed for the land were subsequently used in other Star Wars media, including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and The Mandalorian,",

The catwalk above the station is a location where Rey, Chewbacca, Vi Moradi or First Order stormtroopers may speak to visitors. Rey and Kylo Ren fought a lightsaber duel on the catwalk during the media event on the opening day of Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Hollywood Studios.

Most features will only work when the user is within Black Spire Outpost. The game was first released as part of a May 24th, 2019 update to the Disneyland section of the app, days prior to the opening of that park's Galaxy's Edge area on May 31st.\n\nFeatures of Datapad include \"hacking\" (to interact with door panels or droids), \"scanning\" (to inspect cargo), \"translation\" (to decode all the Aurebesh signs throughout Galaxy's Edge), \"tuning\" (to listen into secret communications), and \"Outpost Control\" (a game in which visitors choose First Order or Resistance). As users play and explore they will unlock a variety of outfits, equipment, star maps, schematics, droid data, transmissions, and titles. They can also earn credits by completing jobs and gain reputation with the First Order, Resistance, and \"scoundrel\" factions.\n\nA variation of the Datapad app for guests of the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel experience was later released, also a part of Play Disney. The Datapad also works in conjunction with the MagicBand+ based \"Star Wars: Batuu Bounty Hunters\" interactive experience exclusive to the Disney's Hollywood Studios version of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge where the scanner will reveal your quarry.\n\n",

During this time, the cast members' costumes were unveiled. On April 13, Galaxy's Edge featured in a panel at Celebration Chicago. During the panel, Mark Hamill appeared via pre-recorded video to announce a Twitter sweepstakes to win a trip to the attraction.\n\nThe land opened on May 31, 2019 at Disneyland. This followed opening ceremonies on May 29, in which Disney CEO Bob Iger was accompanied by George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Billy Dee Williams, with Ford dedicating Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run to the late Peter Mayhew. Initial attendance fell significantly below expectations, which Iger attributed to an increase of ticket and hotel prices, a fear of overcrowding, and the fact that Rise of the Resistance had yet to open. Senior EVP and CFO Christine McCarthy also cited lower passholders attendance due to crowd control policies. Several Galaxy's Edge-themed panels were held at Disney's D23 Expo on August 23. The land opened on August 29, 2019 at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World. As before, there was an opening ceremony on the previous day.\n\nFrom September 24-30, a plethora of Galaxy's Edge tie-ins aired on Disney's TV programming on ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, and ESPN\u2014including the two-hour special Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge \u2013 Adventure Awaits on September 29. On November 28, ABC's Magical Holiday Celebration included Portugal. The Man performing at Galaxy's Edge\u2014the first musical act to perform at the land. The land was later covered in episodes of Disney+'s The Imagineering Story and One Day At Disney.\n\nRise of the Resistance opened on December 5, 2019 at Walt Disney World, accompanied by another press tour. It opened on January 17, 2020 at Disneyland. A smaller version of Galaxy's Edge will also open sometime after 2021 at Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris Resort. However, as of August 2022, this is now uncertain following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn May 27, 2022, it was revealed that characters from different timelines will appear as well, such as Boba Fett and Fennec Shand. Characters from different stories and timelines won't intersect with other characters or stories that would not be appropriate for them in their given timeline.\n\nOn July 27, 2022, the Batuu Bounty Hunters game debuted at Walt Disney World.

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Development[]\n\nIn total, Galaxy's Edge took over six years from concept to final unveiling. Disney CEO Robert Iger first announced it at the D23 Expo on August 15, 2015, stating that the company would be building a Star Wars\u2013themed land in Disneyland Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and in Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The announcement stated that these lands would be fourteen acres, making them the largest single-land expansions in the company's history. During the Q1 FY17 Earnings call for The Walt Disney Company on February 7, 2017, Iger announced that the new lands would open in the year 2019.\n\nAccording to J. Daniel Jenkins, a former Disney Imagineer who helped design Galaxy's Edge, an early concept for the park would have set it in select locations from Episodes I\u2013VI. This evolved into the original planet Batuu once Iger viewed the first footage from The Force Awakens and became confident in the prospects of the sequel trilogy. Fellow Imagineer Scott Trowbridge explained the reasoning: \"The answer really is we know those places and we know those stories that happen there and we know that we're not in them. Black Spire Outpost is an opportunity that's designed from the very get go to be a place that invites exploration and discovery. A place that invites us to become a character in the world of Star Wars. And to the extent that we want to, to participate in the stories of Star Wars.\" At one point, the Imagineers also considered building two entirely different Star Wars lands instead of two of the same concept.\n\nDuring the \"Star Wars and Disney Parks: A Galaxy in the Making\" panel at Celebration Orlando, Imagineer Asa Kalama stated that what they were building would be canonical. It was later revealed to take place after The Last Jedi through promotional material for the book series Flight of the Falcon. During development, the attraction had as many as 1,100 Disney employees working on the project. By early 2019, this had dropped to 600.\n\nIn the lead-up to the annual D23 Expo, the Disney Parks Blog unveiled a logo for the event \"Walt Disney Parks and Resorts: A Galaxy of Stories,\" which would debut on July 14\u201316. The event gave guests a glimpse of the locations, starships, creatures, and droids that would populate the outpost that would act as a setting for the park, and unveiled a detailed model for the 14-acre theme park that would debut in 2019, alongside artwork and media showcasing its development. On December 16, 2017, during the parks' Galactic Nights event, more information about the ride and its development process was unveiled to the public via Lucasfilm vice president Doug Chiang as well as Imagineers Chris Beatty, Robin Reardon, and Scott Trowbridge. In particular, it was revealed via construction photos that development had recently \"topped out\" after the highest construction point was in place. It was also revealed that, among other things, there would be a toy shop with concept art unveiled, with Beatty explaining that the inspiration for its design was from marketplaces in Morocco, and that, fitting with its design inspiration, all the wares are handmade arts and crafts similar to those found in Moroccan marketplaces. In addition, the water fountains would have a unique design. (He later revealed that the overall look of the park was inspired by Petrified Forest National Park.) Much of the production work was handled by the same Pinewood Studios artists who worked on the films.\n\nChiang also revealed that they were building X-wing models for the theme park and differentiated them from the movie models. Some concept art also showcased the Millennium Falcon portion of the attraction, including an entirely new location composed of overgrowth in a sewer-like area. A set of trading cards were also unveiled to the public, which revealed some new details about the ride, in particular confirming that BB-8 and Kylo Ren would be present in the ride, as well as hinting at a droid character called \"R3X\" that was later revealed to be RX-24 from the original Star Tours ride. The same cards also had map pieces that revealed some locations on Batuu, in particular the Surabat River Valley, Docking Bay 9, Merchant Row, and Black Spire Station, would be present in the ride and gave some details about the location and a translation key for an Aurebesh poem on the borders of some cards. Some of the props designed for the land were subsequently used in other Star Wars media, including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and The Mandalorian,\n\nOn January 11, 2018, the Star Wars Launch Bay attraction at Disneyland included a piece of the full model of the upcoming attraction that was unveiled at D23, marking it the second Disney theme park to include part of the scale model, the first being Disney's Hollywood Studios. A short preview video was released on May 22. On May 24, 2019 the Disneyland website and mobile app updated park maps to include, and confirm, the layout of Galaxy's Edge. The Disney Parks Blog revealed new park guide books including the new land.\n\n",

Galaxy's Edge has been featured in three episodes of Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures: \"Millennium Falcon - Smugglers Run,\" \"Black Spire Outpost,\" \"Rise of the Resistance.\" A Galaxy's Edge-themed content pack was released for The Sims in September 2020. The Art of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge was released in Spring 2021. A Hasbro toy line was produced. A LEGO set of the Intersystem Transport Ship was also released; A special code will allow you to use the ship in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.\n\nOriginally, certain merchandise was meant to be sold exclusively inside Galaxy's Edge. However, due to a drop in attendance as a result of park closures and travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Disney parks began releasing Galaxy's Edge merchandise outside of the land itself. A variety of merchandise became available at Target stores beginning August 30, 2020. That September, merchandise also became available at Disneyland's WonderGround Gallery and at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom Emporium, as well as online and internationally via shopDisney.com.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - Layout[]\n\nGalaxy's Edge is set on Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, a planet on the edge of the Outer Rim Territories (just before Wild Space). The time period is between the events of The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. It was designed to feel like a real world, blending seamlessly into the park and having no obvious ride markers. Guests encounter three types of cast members: First Order, Resistance and villagers. Visitors are able to use an app called Star Wars: Datapad to aid in navigating the land; features include \"hacking\" (to interact with door panels or droids), \"scanning\" (to inspect cargo), \"translation\" (to decode all the Aurebesh signs throughout the attraction), \"tuning\" (to listen in to secret communications), and \"Outpost Control\" (a game in which visitors choose First Order or Resistance).\n\nThe park features two attractions: Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run (which puts guests behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon) and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance (which throws guests into the middle of a battle between the First Order and the Resistance). The official names for the attractions were announced November 17, 2018 at the Destination D event. The Target-exclusive Blu-ray for Solo: A Star Wars Story includes a featurette called \"The Millennium Falcon: From Page to Park,\" which details how the Millennium Falcon ride was developed for Galaxy's Edge.\n\nOga's Cantina is a small dining establishment that serves Star Wars\u2013themed food and drink. Coca-Cola products are available at the attraction, with special in-universe Aurebesh designs. Various shops throughout Galaxy's Edge sell in-universe items; in developing these vendors, Disney Imagineers visited Istanbul and Morocco, and looked at old concept art from the Lucasfilm Archives. Visitors can choose to build their own lightsabers at Savi's Workshop, with the option to either make custom lightsabers or choose pre-established designs.\n\n",

The rogues, smugglers, and adventurers who eke out a living on the largest settlement on the planet, Black Spire Outpost, are here to avoid prying eyes and unnecessary complications.

And when a shuttle full of stormtroopers lands in her wake, determined to root her out, she has no idea where to find help.\n\nTo survive, Vi will have to seek out the good-hearted heroes hiding in a world that redefines scum and villainy.

The map cards contained locations for the planet Batuu, as well as a poem in Aurebesh along the border of the card. In Black Spire Station's case, the poem line was \"THOSE BROKEN AND TOSSED\". According to the Walt Disney World news page, Black Spire Station is the place where droid parts could be purchased. The catwalk above the station is a location where Rey, Chewbacca, Vi Moradi or First Order stormtroopers may speak to visitors. Rey and Kylo Ren fought a lightsaber duel on the catwalk during the media event on the opening day of Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Hollywood Studios. The Disneyland version of the catwalk was the site of another duel between Rey and Kylo Ren at the conclusion of the Blaze Your Path special event for Make-A-Wish children on 11 September 2024.\n\n",

The announcement stated that these lands would be fourteen acres in size, making them the largest single land expansions in company history. The two attractions announced for the land included a ride that puts guests behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon and a ride that throws guests into the middle of a battle between the First Order and the Resistance. it was also announced that the lands' setting would be on a yet-to-be-seen planet on the edge of the Outer Rim Territories, just before Wild Space. During the Q1 FY17 Earnings call for The Walt Disney Company on February 7, 2017, Iger announced that the new lands would open in the year 2019. During the \"Star Wars and Disney Parks: A Galaxy in the Making\" panel at Celebration Orlando, Asa Kalama of Walt Disney Imagineering stated that what they were building would be canonical.\n\nDuring Galactic Nights, a set of promotional trading cards were issued that hinted at what would be found at the attraction regarding Black Spire Outpost. The front of the cards depicted certain scenes of what was likely to occur, such as an encounter with Kylo Ren, bargaining with Dok-Ondar, and Hondo and Chewbacca agreeing to a deal, among others. The back of each card depicted part of a nine-panel map depicting the various locales of the outpost as well as some details about the specific locations. Eight of the cards had a phrase in Aurebesh describing the location which, thanks to Twitter user Nick Tierce, was revealed to say in full \"At the edge of the galaxy so far away, black was the spire that called me to stay, a beacon for drifters forgotten and lost, the spire summoned those broken and tossed, come stay here forever or just pass on through, the spirit of the black spire will forever change you\".\n\n",

        "content": "# Batuu - Behind the scenes[]\n\nDisney CEO Robert Iger first announced at the D23 Expo on August 15, 2015 that the company would be building a Star Wars\u2013themed land in Disneyland Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and in Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. It was also announced that the lands' setting would be an outpost on a yet-to-be-seen planet on the edge of the Outer Rim Territories, just before Wild Space.\n\nBatuu's landscape of mountains and rock spires came about as a necessity for the Disneyland installation of Galaxy's Edge, which required the re-routing of the Disneyland Railroad and the Rivers of America in Frontierland. The reworked northern bend of the river features rocky cliffs, trees and waterfalls that block views of the trading post to visitors riding the various vehicles that travel along the river. In turn, Batuu's mountains and spires become an extended background element for the river, allowing for Galaxy's Edge and Frontierland to better function as neighbors. Real-world inspirations for this rockwork includes Bandelier National Monument and the Bisti Badlands in New Mexico, Badlands National Park in South Dakota, and Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona.\n\nIn an interview with StarWars.com about his 2018 novel Thrawn: Alliances, author Timothy Zahn expressed interest in exploring Batuu more in future books.\n\n",

Han Solo, frozen in carbonite, is being taken to the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. As Princess Leia mounts a rescue mission and Darth Vader scours the galaxy for Luke Skywalker, another sinister figure emerges. Cunning and ruthless, leader of a powerful crime syndicate, he will pit himself against Vader for the favor of their mutual master\u2026 the dreaded Emperor.\n\nSHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE\n\nHis name is Xizor, Underlord of a galaxywide criminal organization, and he seeks to displace Darth Vader as the Emperor's right hand. To do so, he will hatch a brilliantly evil plan to discredit Vader in the Emperor's eyes. In the meantime, he will join the Dark Lord in an unholy alliance whose common target is Luke.\n\nThough he is cold and reptilian, Xizor has a certain predatory charisma that not even Leia can totally resist. Against the judgment of Chewbacca, who has promised the frozen Han to keep her from harm, Leia walks willingly into Xizor's lair in a dangerous play of passion and willpower to get the information she needs to defeat him.\n\nAnd as the struggle between Xizor and Vader intensifies, Luke finds himself the potential prize of the two most evil entities in the galaxy\u2014one who wants him alive, and one who wants him dead.\n\nFeaturing original Star Wars music, the specially composed Xizor's Theme, and sound effects, this exclusive Star Wars production adds an exciting new chapter to the Star Wars saga, and introduces important new characters no Star Wars fan will want to miss!\n\n",
