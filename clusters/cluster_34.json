Within the movement's ranks were former Clone Commander Rex, who served as the leader of the organization. Other clone officers included clone commando Captain Gregor, CT-99 clone commando Corporal Echo and Captain Howzer. Troopers within the Clone Underground included Fireball, Greer, Nemec, Samson, a clone who used armor with orange markings, and another clone who used armor with red markings. Rex and the Clone Underground were briefly connected with the Imperial trooper Slip, and at times operated with the genetically defective Clone Force 99. Following her desertion of the Empire, former Chief Scientist Emerie Karr agreed to join the Clone Underground, eager to make up for her past misdeeds, along with former clone prisoner Vik and many other clones that were imprisoned in the Galactic Empire's Tantiss Base.\n\n",

The goals of the Clone Underground included helping disillusioned clone troopers escape the Imperial Military and fighting the Empire in the name of the fallen Galactic Republic. By 18 BBY, the network had several clone contacts within the Empire working as informants, such as Slip until his death. The group also had a sympathetic senator in the Imperial Senate itself, Riyo Chuchi. The network managed to rescue multiple clones throughout its history, including Gregor, Fireball, Nemec, Captain Howzer, and two other clone troopers from his squad. Additionally, Clone Force 99 member and former Advanced Recon Commando, Echo, joined the network following the passing of the Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill. Rex maintained contact with and was occasionally assisted by the rest of Clone Force 99, which included Hunter, Omega, Wrecker, Tech, and Crosshair.\n\nThe network possessed a ship known as the Remora that was equipped with a detachable leech vessel, as well as several captured Rho-class transport shuttles. The Clone Underground helped rescue clone troopers as per their bond as brothers and conducted other actions that harried the spread of the fledgling Galactic Empire. The network's hideout was on the Wild Space planet of Teth within the ruins of an abandoned B'omarr Order Monastery, though they also made use of a repair shop on Coruscant.\n\n",

Increasingly desperate, Howzer insisted that they needed to call in Clone Force 99, a unit of clone commandos retired to the planet Pabu, since one of their members, Crosshair, was also imprisoned on the Base and Howzer suspected him to know about its location due to his previous Imperial affiliation. However, another assassin was deployed to Teth in a mission to eliminate CX-1. He infiltrated the monastery and called for a Recovery Strike Team to reinforce him after identifying the presence of Omega in the compound. In the ensuing firefight, the assassin killed many clones, including Fireball, Nemec, Samson, along with a clone who used armor with orange markings, and another clone who used armor with red markings, and forced the remaining clones (Rex, Howzer, and Clone Force 99) to flee into the jungle, where they were cornered by the Strike Team.

After covering the retreat of his allies, Gregor was reported as missing in action after the battle and was considered to be dead. Despite his efforts, the rest of Gregor's squad perished in the battle.\n\nHowever, Gregor had survived the battle. His escape shuttle crashing on the planet Abafar in the town of Pons Ora, although he had not escaped unscathed. Gregor suffered from amnesia after a traumatic brain injury and, unable to remember that he was a soldier of the Republic Army, sought work and was given a job working as a dishwasher and cleaner at the Power Sliders diner by the Sullustan Borkus for nothing more than room and board. He worked at the diner for some time and, due to his amnesia, never realized who he was. Borkus claimed his armor, weapons, and other gear and kept it, never telling Gregor who he was.\n\nAfter Colonel Meebur Gascon and his team of droids crash-landed on Abafar as they attempted to return to Republic lines after a mission, they eventually made their way into the town. As Gascon attempted to find food, he ran into Gregor behind the diner. Gregor offered him food but was confused when Gascon attempted to tell him that he was a clone. Gascon began to think that Gregor was working undercover, and a disoriented Gregor left Gascon and later went home.\n\nLater, Gregor returned home from work and was greeted by a hologram of his old friend Rex. Shocked, Gregor listened as Gascon explained who he was. When R2-D2 scanned Gregor's arm to learn his designation, CC-5576-39, Gascon read through Gregor's report, which listed him as missing in action.

Shortly thereafter, the Ghost docked with Senator Organa's corvette, the Tantive IV, where Jarrus returned the droids to the grateful senator\u2014though the rebels did not know who Organa was. In exchange for returning the droids, Organa provided them with a monetary reward. Jarrus disembarked, and R2-D2 gave Organa the recordings he had made on the rebel cell. Unknown to Jarrus, Organa was also part of fledging Rebel Alliance that communicated with and gave missions to rebel cells across the galaxy. As a result of the mission, Syndulla came into contact with Ahsoka Tano, one of the leaders of the movement. Tano, who identified herself only as \"Fulcrum,\" would often send the rebels missions to strike against the Empire.\n\nBridger's actions in saving Orrelios' life remained a source of contention between the two for a short time after the mission. Bridger frequently reminded Orrelios, with whom he shared quarters aboard the Ghost, of how he saved the Lasat's life from Agent Kallus, leading to fighting between the two bunkmates. The fighting intensified enough that Syndulla sent both of them on a supply run together, in order to get them off of the ship. During the supply run, the two inadvertently found themselves in a skirmish with Imperial forces and stole a TIE fighter, which they then used to attack a group of Imperial Troop Transports and rescue imprisoned civilians. The situation allowed Bridger and Orrelios, who had to work together to return to the Ghost, to settle their differences.\n\nThe crew encountered Organa again some time later, during a mission to rescue Jarrus from Imperial captivity; Jarrus had been captured by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who wanted to learn about the wider rebel movement. Chopper sent a message to \"Fulcrum\" and asked for reinforcements to assist them in their battle against the Empire in orbit of the planet Mustafar. A rebel fleet arrived in orbit of Mustafar and helped the crew escape from the Empire, marking the first time rebel cells began openly working together. Once the rebels were in hyperspace, Organa contacted the crew via hologram, where Syndulla revealed his true identity. The crew also met Tano and learned that she was Fulcrum.\n\nDuring the liberation of Lothal, Vizago openly regretted meeting Bridger that day because it had put him on the Empire's radar permanently.\n\n",

Unfortunately, due to his two traumatic brain injuries, he suffered from episodes of mild insanity.\n\nFour years prior to the Battle of Yavin, the clones were approached by the crew of the Ghost, who were looking for information on abandoned military installations for the rebel network. When Kanan Jarrus identified them as clones, Wolffe, in turn, recognized him as a Jedi and let off a few shots. Gregor eagerly raised his rifle but Rex calmed the situation. When Ezra Bridger explained that they were sent by Ahsoka Tano, Rex welcomed them as friends. Later on, Gregor encouraged the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios to help the clones hunt for joopas. But he later reveals to Ezra that Zeb was in fact the bait, resulting in the Lasat being swallowed by the joopa, whom Gregor nicknamed Big Bongo. After managing to kill the joopa, Zeb was none too happy to learn that he was bait, but was calmed when Gregor pointed out that he helped catch Big Bongo.\n\nWhile settling down for dinner, Sabine discovered that one of the clones, Wolffe, had contacted the Empire. While Gregor and Rex had quickly trusted the Ghost crew, Wolffe wanted to protect his comrades from being persecuted by the Empire for harboring these rebels. When confronted, Wolffe admitted his wrongdoing and accepted Rex's reasoning that the rebels were their friends. After discovering and destroying an Imperial probe droid, the clones and rebels prepared for the impending Imperial assault. While Kanan tried to convince the clones to come with them, Rex was adamant that he and his comrades would stay behind to hold the Imperials back while the rebels escaped.\n\nThe rebels reluctantly departed on their auxiliary ship Phantom to rendezvous with the Ghost in space. Shortly later, a force of three AT-AT walkers led by the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus, a perennial foe of the crew of the Ghost. While outnumbered and outgunned, Gregor and his companions faced off against the Imperials in their lone AT-TE walker. At Ezra's urging, the rebels returned to rescue the clones and succeeded in defeating the Imperial force, forcing Kallus and his men to flee into the desert. After that, Gregor and his fellow clones saluted Kanan and his Padawan, and Rex agreed to join the Rebellion whilst Gregor and Wolffe stayed behind on Seelos, taking the remaining AT-AT walker for their new home.\n\n",

Gregor tried to reclaim it and clumsily lunged, still not functioning to his abilities as a clone commando. Borkus easily knocked him down, but was overpowered by the droids of D-Squad.

Gregor seemingly sacrificed himself after shooting containers of rhydonium to destroy the droids that would have shot down Gascon's fleeing shuttle. However, Gregor survived the explosion, albeit with several intense head injuries, eventually making his way back to the Republic and his comrades, and is promoted to the rank of Clone Commander.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's BTL-B Y-wing fighter-bomber - Order 66[]\n\nThe Y-wing was utilized by the Galactic Republic Navy late in the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. In 19 BBY, the Y-wing was part of the onboard complement of the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal when it was present above the planet Mandalore shortly after the end of the recent siege, in which the Mandalore resistance and forces of the Grand Army of the Republic had defeated the Shadow Collective and captured its leader, the rogue Sith Lord Maul. The Tribunal, under the command of former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Clone Commander Rex, was to deliver Maul to the Jedi High Council on Coruscant. At the time, the Y-wing was docked in the Tribunal's repair bay above an exit in the capital ship's bottom hull, and was the only ship in the repair bay not currently undergoing maintenance.\n\nHowever, shortly after the Tribunal jumped into hyperspace, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious issued Order 66, a command which compelled the clone troopers of the Grand Army to turn on and execute their Jedi Generals through inhibitor chips implanted in their brains. Tano was forced to go on the run onboard the ship, releasing Maul from the detention level as a distraction before freeing Rex from the brainwashing with the help of three astromech droids, including her old unit R7-A7. Once Rex's chip had been removed, he and Tano attempted to escape the Star Destroyer. However, the escape pods had been destroyed because of orders Rex had given while he was brainwashed, so they were forced to head for the hangar, hoping to steal a shuttle.\n\nMaul, left to his own devices, destroyed the Tribunal's hyperdrive, setting the cruiser out of hyperspace and onto a collision course with a moon. When Tano and Rex reached the hangar control room, they discovered both that the starship was doomed and that the clone troopers, led by Clone Lieutenant ARC trooper CT-5597 \"Jesse\", had assembled in the hangar to try and prevent any escapes. Noticing that Jesse and his men were standing atop the lifts to the repair bay, Tano concocted a plan to make it easier for her and Rex to reach the shuttle by sending most of the clones to the maintenance level. However, while Tano and Rex were fighting off the remaining clones in the hangar, Maul entered and stole the Nu-class attack/transport shuttle in bay 12 that they had intended to take. Tano was unable to prevent Maul from escaping, being forced to let him go as Rex was in danger of being overwhelmed by clone reinforcements that had arrived. She cut a hole in the floor to bring herself and Rex down to the repair bay, with droids RG-G1 and CH-33P launching the lifts back up before the clones destroyed them.\n\nTano and Rex attempted to find another ship to escape in, but discovered that almost all of the ships in the repair bay were under maintenance and thus unflyable. After taking out some clones that remained in the bay, Tano spotted the Y-wing in its docking port and pointed it out to Rex. They repelled some more clones before running towards the starfighter, but the lifts began to descend as Jesse's forces had gained control of them. As Tano began to defend herself against their blaster fire, Rex continued running towards the Y-wing, shouting for Tano to get him over to the ship. When he reached the edge of the hole, Tano Force pushed him across the gap and onto the fighter, where he managed to get a grip on it as Tano turned her attention back to the clones' fire. Climbing onto the bomber, Rex stunned a few of the attacking clones before opening the cockpit hatch and getting inside.",

The clones and Tano lost their footing, and Rex, seeing the situation, took the pilot's seat and shouted for Tano to get over to the Y-wing. Tano leapt for the starfighter, but it was knocked free of its mooring and blown into the trail of debris flowing behind the doomed Star Destroyer, leaving Tano in freefall. Rex managed to activate the Y-wing after a brief struggle, getting it under control and flying it back towards the Tribunal. He looked around for Tano, opening the gunner's hatch when he finally found her. Tano grabbed the hatch, but lost her grip and was set flying again. As Rex followed her in the fighter, she slowed herself down by running along one of the Tribunal's dislodged ion engines, and was able to successfully board the Y-wing after leaping off of it. Rex maneuvered the starfighter away from the ongoing crash, and he and Tano watched the Tribunal sink beneath the clouds.\n\nTano and Rex landed the Y-wing at the crash site, where they salvaged the remains of R7-A7 and other useful items, as well as burying the dead, as no one onboard the Tribunal had survived. As Tano spent a final moment at the graveyard, Rex walked back to the fighter and stowed a shovel he had used in a rack on its side, before turning back to look at Tano.",

For the Battle of Sarrish, Gregor and his men were assigned to Foxtrot Group, an elite clone commando squad. The battle proved to be a great defeat for the Republic, and Gregor was forced to retreat into space. His transport ended up crash landing on Abafar. The crash caused him to suffer from amnesia, and he was rescued by a Sullustan named Borkus who took advantage of his condition to put him to work as a dishwasher in his business. Gregor regained his memories after Colonel Meebur Gascon and his unit identified him after their chance arrival in Pons Ora. He was thought to have been killed in an explosion trying to protect the colonel and his companions in a firefight against Separatist droids, but survived, although he sustained a traumatic brain injury.\n\nAfter the Clone Wars ended, Gregor was sent by the new Galactic Empire to a secret facility on the planet Daro, where he and other clone commandos were tasked with training the \"TK troopers\" which were to replace the clones. Gregor quickly realized he wanted out and sent a distress signal to the clone deserter Rex, who was unable to come himself but sent the Bad Batch, another group of deserters, to rescue him.\n\nFifteen years after the end of the Clone Wars, Gregor was still alive and was living in a modified AT-TE on Seelos with Captain Rex and Commander Wolffe. In 1 BBY, Gregor participated in the Liberation of Lothal, where the Lothal resistance group and the Spectres drove the Galactic Empire off Lothal once and for all. During the conflict, Gregor was killed, passing away after telling Rex that it was an honor to serve with him and to fight for a cause the clones actually chose to believe in.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Personality and traits[]\n\nAs a clone commando, Gregor was trained in combat and could operate a blaster. Despite suffering a brief spell of amnesia, Gregor was loyal to the Galactic Republic and willing to put his life on the line for it. Since Gregor removed his control chip, he was unaffected by the transmission of Order 66. Due to the brain damage he had sustained during the Clone Wars, Gregor experienced occasional periods of insanity during the Age of the Empire. By the time he had defected from the Empire, his voice had gained a distinct rasp. When recruited by the Empire in training new recruits, Gregor was loyal to the Empire until he realized their ways was not what he signed up for and decided to defect from the Empire. Even when he was deemed a traitor by the Empire, Gregor openly remarked how proud he was for choosing to defect from the Empire.\n\nUnlike Wolffe, Gregor, along with Rex, was not hostile towards Kanan Jarrus and his rebel cell, the Spectres. He befriended Ezra Bridger and particularly Garazeb Orrelios, and convinced the rebels to accompany him on a hunt for joopas in return for Rex supplying them with information on former Republic military installations. Gregor and Wolffe were loyal to Rex and looked up to him as their leader, and they were willing to fight to the death in order to protect their new-found rebel friends from Imperial forces led by Agent Kallus. Gregor, Rex and Wolffe soon came to respect Kanan and Ezra after the rebels came to their aid and drove off Kallus' forces.\n\nWhile Gregor thought that Ezra's plan to liberate Lothal had a slim chance of success, his loyalty to Rex and Ezra led him to volunteer for the mission. Gregor was a competent fighter and soldier who was able to fight as part of a team. Before he died during the liberation of Lothal, Gregor stated to Rex that it was an honor to fight with him, and for what they chose to believe in.\n\nGregor was a human male who stood 1.83 meters tall, or 6 feet. He had black hair, brown eyes, and tan skin.\n\n",

Meanwhile, the new government had plans to phase out the clones and create a new army composed of recruits. As part of Project War-Mantle, a secret base was constructed on the Outer Rim planet Daro where the new \"TK troopers\" were to be trained. Gregor becomes an instructor at a facility on Daro where the next generation of Imperial troops is being trained. Fifty clone commandos, including Gregor, were dispatched to the base as trainers. However, Gregor quickly realized that he did not want to be a part of the new Empire. He escaped the base, but was hunted. He managed to plant a rescue beacon before being recaptured and imprisoned. The beacon sent a distress signal to Captain Rex, who had also deserted from the military when he declined to obey Order 66. Unable to go himself, Rex asked the Bad Batch, a group of fellow deserters, to carry out the rescue.\n\nGregor was in his cell on Cellblock 25 when he demanded that the trooper on guard duty be useful and bring him some food. The trooper retorted that he was a traitor, and Gregor snapped back that it was \"Captain Traitor\" as the trooper walked away, before muttering that the recruit was an \"Insubordinate pleb.\" Soon after that, the guards were neutralized by Hunter, Echo, and Tech as the Bad Batch approached Gregor's cell to set him free. Echo asked Gregor if he was CC-5576, and Gregor said it depended on who was asking. Tech said that Rex had sent them, and Gregor stood up and told them his name, saying they had to move out. As Hunter, Echo, Tech, and Gregor were making a swift escape from the base, Gregor took a hard shot to the chest by Scorch but survived and was evacuated from Daro at the cost of Hunter's capture and was left with information broker Ciddarin Scaleback on Ord Mantell. At some point his behavioral modification biochip was removed.\n\n",

After a brief battle, the rebels managed to capture the command center and initiate a faux Protocol 13, causing the entire Imperial garrison on Lothal to evacuate aboard the Dome.\n\nBefore they could fire up the Dome's thrusters, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard his Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera and blocked their exit. Thrawn managed to force Ezra to meet him aboard the Chimaera by bombarding Lothal's Capital City. In Ezra's absence, the rebels embarked on Sabine's plan to recapture the power terminals powering up the Dome's deflector shield generator in order to protect Capital City from Imperial bombardment.\n\nGregor along with Zeb and Kallus were assigned to Team B, which was tasked with recapturing and restarting the south tower's power terminal.

While Zeb fought Rukh, Gregor and Kallus dealt with the others. During the battle, Gregor was shot in the right side of the chest by an Imperial weapons technician.

        "content": "# Rex's battle strategy algorithm - History[]\n\nRex developed the algorithm, with only Fives and Echo also aware of its existence, some time before the Battle of Lola Sayu. With Echo's apparent death in an explosion during the action on Lola Sayu and Fives' later death on Coruscant after having allegedly gone insane, Rex was seemingly the only person alive who knew of the algorithm's existence. However, Echo had not actually died at the Citadel. Severely injured in the explosion of the Sheathipede-class Type B shuttle he had been attempting to reclaim, he was salvaged by the Separatists, eventually winding up in the hands of the Techno Union. He was turned into a cyborg, and the Union extracted information from his brain, allowing them to use him to work out the algorithm. Kept in stasis in a facility in Purkoll on Skako Minor, he was unaware of his surroundings or what was happening to him.\n\nWhen the campaign for control of the planet Anaxes began, Admiral Trench, in command of the Separatist forces, had the algorithm transmitted from Skako Minor to a Cyber Center constructed on Anaxes' surface, where he could review it from his flagship. Over the course of several weeks, the Republic's hold on the planet began to slip away, with their forces sustaining unusual losses. Captain Rex believed that the Separatists were somehow using his strategies and algorithm, and came to the conclusion that Echo was the only possible way the enemy could have gotten a hold of them, meaning that he might still be alive. He and Clone Commander Cody came forward to Jedi Generals Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker with the theory that the Separatists had somehow figured out how to counter Rex, but the Captain was loath to admit his idea that Echo was still alive as he thought the Jedi might think he was crazy for suggesting it. Rex and Cody received permission to lead a strike team behind enemy lines to the Cyber Center to find out how they were being countered.\n\nCody called in Clone Force 99, an irregular unit of clone commandos informally known as the \"Bad Batch,\" to participate in the mission alongside himself, Rex, ARC trooper Jesse, and clone medic Kix. When let in on the theory that Echo was still alive, Cody was skeptical. En route, the gunship the strike team was travelling was shot down, leaving Cody severely injured and Rex in charge of the mission, as Kix stayed behind with Cody to wait for an evac. Upon breaching the Cyber Center in a two-pronged attack, Tech of the Bad Batch accessed the center's computers and found that the algorithm was a live transmission instead of a stored program. Digging deeper, Tech found a transmission of Echo's voice, and when Rex asked for the voice's identity, the response was Echo's identification number, CT-1409, proving he was alive.\n\nThe discovery led Rex, Skywalker, and the Bad Batch to launch an unsanctioned mission to Skako Minor to rescue Echo from the Techno Union. Despite heavy resistance from battle droids, and Trench having warned Wat Tambor that the infiltration was likely, the strike team was able to get to Echo and release him from the stasis chamber. After Tambor's battle droids failed to recapture Echo, Tambor decided to hold off on informing the Separatist military of the loss as he wanted to find a way to recoup the lost profits that the ARC trooper's escape represented.\n\n",

The 501st's leader was subsequently replaced by Jedi General Pong Krell, a Besalisk known for his high success rate in battle, but at an astonishingly high casualty rate. Shortly after taking command, Krell ordered the platoon, to march down the main road in an attempt to reach the Umbaran capital city as fast as possible, a decision that was looked upon as near suicide due to the likelihood of traps and ambushes from the Umbaran militia, which was highly active in the area.\n\nAlthough Clone Captain Rex protested the order, he resignedly led the platoon into battle. Before the platoon were able to make contact with enemy forces, they lost two soldiers to land mines placed by the insurgency. As expected, the militia attacked in force, resulting in heavy casualties to the platoon. The platoon retreated, taking losing even more troopers in the process. The depleted unit was eventually rescued by the main 501st as they withdrew from contact, angering Krell but saving the survivors of the platoon.\n\n",

Infiltrating the Separatist Cyber Center on Anaxes, Rex and Clone Force 99 member Tech discovered that the algorithm was actually being broadcast live from Skako Minor by a still-alive Echo, who was in the custody of the Separatist-aligned Techno Union.

Part of a deployed 501st battalion, the platoon was part of the Grand Army of the Republic's offensive on the planet Umbara, and participated in the initial landing of the battle.\n\nAs the battle progressed further towards the planet's capital, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, the 501st's revered leader, was relieved by Jedi General Pong Krell after he was called back to Coruscant. Krell wasted no time in deploying the platoon on a march down the main road to the capital city, a move protested by Clone Captain Rex, who also led the unit. Nonetheless, they followed orders, which led to a deadly ambush from Umbaran Militia, causing numerous casualties and the forced retreat of the platoon.\n\nAs the 501st progressed further into Umbaran territory, Krell ordered the platoon, along with the rest of the 501st, to advance through a narrow gorge towards an airbase, a vital target for the Republic due to its capability to supply starfighters to the joint Confederacy and Umbaran defensive efforts. The decision was met with some resistance, as members of the platoon voiced their concern about Krell's full-frontal attack method, which barely constituted as a tactic at all.\n\nConcerns aside, the platoon, backed by the rest of the legion, advanced into Umbaran territory. They were met with heavy resistance by Impeding Assault Tanks and mobile heavy cannons, but due to the rebellious actions of platoon members Hardcase and Fives, the clone forces were able to repel the attacks using the Umbaran's own technology against them, as the two troopers managed to commandeer and haphazardly perform deadly strafing runs on the Umbaran tanks.\n\n",

Although Rex suggested that the legion should send recon units out to provide intelligence regarding terrain and the enemy defenses, Krell ordered that the entire legion into a frontal attack. This command was met with some resistance from the already beleaguered clone troopers, especially from Advanced Recon Commando trooper Fives. His dissent was backed by other members of the 501st, but Captain Rex curtly told his friend and comrade that, as soldiers, expected to follow orders\u2014even when they were bordering on suicide.\n\nThe 501st, led by members of the platoon, marched into tentatively into the Confederacy-occupied territory. As expected, the 501st\u2014including Rex's platoon\u2014was attacked by Umbaran Impeding Assault Tanks, which emerged from underground ambush locations to attack the troopers. Significant casualties were sustained by the legion before troopers eventually lured the tanks into a narrow kill zone, enabling troopers armed with RPS-6 rocket launchers and thermal detonators. The clones continued moving forward, executing Umbaran survivors as they moved. However, their victory was short-lived, as Umbaran reinforcements arrived, this time equipped with spider cannons, which were impervious to blaster or rocket fire. The 501st was pushed back once again and was forced to leave behind dead and injured troopers, much to the chagrin of the platoon medic, Kix.\n\nAlthough the 501st was in no position to repel the Umbaran attack, Krell ordered the clones to continue the assault, disregarding the horrendous losses being sustained. In a desperate attempt to destroy the tanks, Rex authorized troopers Hardcase and Fives, both members under his platoon under his direct command, to infiltrate the airbase\u2014a mission that they had been specifically ordered not to attempt. Their mission was successful, and they were able to commandeer two Umbaran starfighters, which they subsequently utilized to strafe the Umbaran tanks, destroying them and enabling the main 501st force to finally capture the base.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - The Joopa and the probe[]\n\nLater, Gregor tasked Orrelios with catching an elusive joopa; a creature that was big enough to feed the clones for an entire year. Orrelios was harnessed to the modified main cannon's energy rod and reel and the Lasat walked along the planet's surface while he held his bo-rifle. As Orrelios continued to walk, Gregor revealed to Bridger and Wren that Orrelios was the bait, further angering Jarrus with the clones, who informed Gregor there was a difference between being the hunter and bait. However, it was too late for Orrelios to escape, as the Big Bongo attacked and swallowed Orrelios whole.\n\nAs Wolffe piloted the AT-TE, chasing after the Big Bongo, Rex instructed Wren to keep her eyes on the regulator next to the main gun. If the line broke, they would lose both the Joopa and Orrelios. Meanwhile, Gregor gave both Bridger and Jarrus an electrostaff. After they both sent two jolts down the line, Bridger jumped onto the each of the balcony to get a better angle for a third round but soon instructed Jarrus to lift him up. Once Wren finished fixing the regulator line, Bridger used both electrostaffs to fire one last jolt to the joopa, causing it to burst through the surface. Rex fired one shot from the main cannon, killing the giant beast.\n\nThat evening, after the clones latched the Big Bongo to the side of the walker, Wren discovered a dwarf probe droid inside the Phantom. The droid opened fire on her and damaged the Phantom's engines. Jarrus chased the droid across the underside of the walker and fired his blaster until the probe was out of his blaster's range. In response, Rex fired a DC-15A blaster rifle from one of the railed balconies of the AT-TE, destroying the droid, but only after it transmitted its recordings to the Empire.\n\nThe next day, the Spectres informed the clones they wanted to leave Seelos, before the Empire arrived. However, Wren reported to Jarrus that a storm was coming. Jarrus informed her that if Empire arrived before they left the surface, the storm would be the least of their problems. After the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer the Relentless arrived in the system, ISB Agent Alexsandr Kallus contacted Wolffe. The former clone commander attempted to convince Kallus the clones made a mistake and had not seen any Rebels. However, Kallus showed Wolffe and Rex the probe's recording of the Phantom on top of the AT-TE. Rex informed Kallus that he would need all his stormtroopers to beat them.\n\n",

Rex knew the battle could be their end, but they would at least go down like a clone should. They opened fire and charged at the opposing AT-ATs. Meanwhile, Bridger reminded Jarrus that he knew better than anyone that the clones would not give up and this fight would be their last.\n\nAs Wolffe continued to move the AT-TE towards the Empire, Kallus ordered his pilots to intensify their forward firepower, slowing the AT-TE down. After Wolffe informed Rex and Gregor he was going for all four of the AT-AT's legs, the Imperial Agent remarked the clones had lost their minds, and the clones quickly found themselves outflanked. At the same time, Jarrus told Bridger, Wren and Orrelios he had his problems with clones, but he did not want them to die.\n\nAs Rex closed his eyes, expecting a warrior's demise, the Phantom fired on the AT-AT's flank, with Jarrus, Bridger and Orrelios jumping onto the roof of the second AT-AT's cockpit. The Jedi used their lightsabers to cut a hole in the roof, with all three Rebels jumping inside the Empire's walker as Rex remarked it was just like the old days. The Spectres fired their commandeered AT-AT on Kallus's walker, while Rex fired on the walker's neck, causing the walker to collapse. In response, Kallus ordered his pilots to evacuate to their speeders.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - The battle begins[]\n\nImmediately after the clones' conversation with Kallus, Wren ran inside the walker, informing the Rebels that the Empire had found them. As a TIE fighter fired on the walker, the Rebels ran outside to destroy the TIE, while Wolffe got the walker moving in evasive maneuvers. On the roof of the AT-TE, Garazeb Orrelios fired a Z-6 rotary blaster cannon and Wren fired a DC-15A blaster rifle, while Jarrus and Bridger protected the Phantom by repelling blasts with their lightsabers. After Rex told them they were wasting ammo, he gave Gregor a rocket launcher. The retired clone commander fired one rocket, which destroyed the TIE.\n\nWhen Rex walked over to the mass-driver cannon, Bridger apologized for being in the clone's seat. Instead of telling the Padawan to move, Rex informed Bridger the traverse controls were on his left, while the elevation was on his right. After Wren finished preparing the Phantom, Bridger insisted they could not leave the clones stranded on the AT-TE. However, before they could make any other decisions, they heard clanking of movement in the distance. Wolffe pointed in the horizon at three All Terrain Armored Transports.\n\nRex used a pair of macrobinoculars to study the opposing walkers. After reporting the AT-ATs had reinforced armor plating, heavy cannons and antipersonnel blasters, Rex instructed Wolffe to change the AT-TE's direction, so they could fight the upcoming battle on his terms. He then told Gregor to drop the Joopa so the walker could move quicker. Gregor let out a whine, then pressed the button on the control panel, dropping the Big Bongo.\n\nAfter the AT-TE turned around, Kallus informed his pilots that the clones could not outrun them. He instructed his walkers to fire at will on the AT-TE. Wren reported that the Phantom was in good enough form to fly. However, Rex retorted it was too late as the AT-ATs were already on top of them. Bridger agreed, and added on that the walkers would shoot them down. Therefore, the clones continued their current trajectory and walked into the storm. Rex informed the Spectres they would all be blind, except for Jarrus and Bridger as they were Jedi. Jarrus reluctantly agreed and ordered everyone inside the AT-TE.\n\n",

While traveling the dusty plains of Seelos, the clones used their modified AT-TE as both a mobile home and a hunting platform. The AT-TE's interior was stripped of some of its military hardware to make room for bunk beds and a kitchen. Meanwhile, the walker's exterior had handrails and ladders installed to make room for balconies, walkways and decks. The railed walkways were adorned with lanterns and bug catchers. The clones also adapted the main mass-driver cannon into a rod and reel for catching joopas, which were large worm-like creatures native to Seelos. Even with the modifications, the main cannon could still fire projectiles.\n\n",

Wren informed them that despite the AT-ATs being practically impervious to blasters, they had one weak spot: the neck. Gregor added on that one well-placed shot from the main gun should destroy the opposing walker. Meanwhile, Kallus ordered his AT-ATs to turn 30 degrees left, in hopes of flanking the AT-TE.\n\nShortly afterwards, Jarrus instructed Wolffe to stop the AT-TE, while Kallus confused on why his forces had not found the AT-TE, ordered his walkers to perform the pincer maneuver. Simultaneously, Jarrus ordered Wolffe to circle left, in double time, before making a full stop. The AT-TE was surrounded by the opposing AT-ATs. However, that worked to the clones and Spectres' advantage, as being in the middle of the Empire's walkers enabled them to get their shot. Gregor offered to take the shot, but Jarrus countered, instructing Bridger to take the shot. Bridger wanted Jarrus to shoot the cannon, but Rex agreed with Jarrus. He told Bridger they needed one Jedi manning the cannon, while the other stayed on the interior to lead them out of their current dilemma. Rex then told Wren to spot Bridger. The clone then tossed Bridger his helmet and told the young Jedi to hang on tight.\n\nAfter Bridger moved the main cannon to around point five, he reported that the targeting scope was useless. Jarrus reminded Bridger he was not going to see the exact position with his eyes, but the walker was there. Trusting himself, Bridger removed Rex's helmet and with his eyes closed, fired the cannon, destroying the neck of the AT-AT in front of them. The neck exploded, causing the walker to collapse. The clones took advantage of the opening, and Wolffe moved the AT-TE past their fallen opponent. However, in response, Kallus ordered his forces to focus their fire on the energy burst.\n\nAs the AT-TE exited the storm, Rex congratulated Bridger on his shot, then ordered him to get the Phantom moving as that was their only chance to escape. Jarrus reminded Bridger they had to bring Rex's intel back to the Rebellion. Before stepping onto the Phantom, Bridger told Jarrus the other part of their mission was to bring Rex back with them and they could not abandon the clones. In response, Rex told Bridger the clones were not being abandoned. Rather, they were covering the Spectres' escape. As Bridger stepped into the Phantom, Rex hopped onto the main cannon and told Bridger they were soldiers, and this is what they were born to do.\n\n",

While on the planet, they modified the AT-TE.\n\nIn 4 BBY, former Jedi Padawan and Force-Sensitive Outcast Ahsoka Tano informed the Spectres she had heard reports Rex was last seen on Seelos. She instructed the Spectres to head to the planet and use the head of an old T-series tactical droid to find him. After Sabine Wren repaired the head, giving it power, it scanned for a signal while simultaneously listing a set of digits over and over again: 7567. The Spectres followed the source of the signal to Rex's AT-TE, landing the Phantom in front of the walker. Rex walked out of the walker's modified sliding back door followed by Wolffe and Gregor. After Ezra Bridger asked him if the numbers '7567' meant anything to him, he replied that they were his birth number. Upon realizing the great commander they were sent to find was a clone, former Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarrus ignited his lightsaber. In response, Wolffe instinctively fired his DC-15A blaster rifle, until Rex ordered both Wolffe and Gregor to stand down. Rex reminded his clone brothers that it was the Empire, rather than the Jedi who had betrayed them. After Bridger explained that Rex's former Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano was the one who sent them to Seelos, he gained the clones trust, who in turn welcomed the Spectres onboard the walker, with the Spectres landing the Phantom on the walker's landing pad.\n\nAt first Jarrus continued to completely reject the clones's offer to help the Spectres. However, Rex soon after overheard Jarrus talking to Bridger about the clones's betrayal of him and his master. Rex informed Jarrus he did not betray his Jedi, as he, Wolffe and Gregor all had their control chips removed.\n\n",

At one point, he befriended Clone Captain Rex. Gregor and his squad of clone commandos participated in the chaotic Battle of Sarrish that ended in a disastrous Republic defeat. After covering the retreat of his allies, Gregor was reported as missing in action after the battle and was considered to be dead. Despite his efforts, the rest of Gregor's squad perished in the battle.\n\nHowever, Gregor had survived the battle. His escape shuttle crashing on the planet Abafar in the town of Pons Ora, although he had not escaped unscathed. Gregor suffered from amnesia after a traumatic brain injury and, unable to remember that he was a soldier of the Republic Army, sought work and was given a job working as a dishwasher and cleaner at the Power Sliders diner by the Sullustan Borkus for nothing more than room and board. He worked at the diner for some time and, due to his amnesia, never realized who he was. Borkus claimed his armor, weapons, and other gear and kept it, never telling Gregor who he was.\n\nAfter Colonel Meebur Gascon and his team of droids crash-landed on Abafar as they attempted to return to Republic lines after a mission, they eventually made their way into the town. As Gascon attempted to find food, he ran into Gregor behind the diner. Gregor offered him food but was confused when Gascon attempted to tell him that he was a clone. Gascon began to think that Gregor was working undercover, and a disoriented Gregor left Gascon and later went home.\n\nLater, Gregor returned home from work and was greeted by a hologram of his old friend Rex. Shocked, Gregor listened as Gascon explained who he was. When R2-D2 scanned Gregor's arm to learn his designation, CC-5576-39, Gascon read through Gregor's report, which listed him as missing in action. Gregor began to remember who he was, recalling the wounded and dying clones from the battle. Gascon convinced Gregor to search for his gear and help them leave the planet and complete their mission.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Helping the Spectres[]\n\nIn the years after the Galactic Empire's creation, Gregor was living with Captain Rex and Commander Wolffe, who had also removed their chips, in a modified AT-TE on the planet Seelos. Unfortunately, due to his two traumatic brain injuries, he suffered from episodes of mild insanity.\n\nFour years prior to the Battle of Yavin, the clones were approached by the crew of the Ghost, who were looking for information on abandoned military installations for the rebel network. When Kanan Jarrus identified them as clones, Wolffe, in turn, recognized him as a Jedi and let off a few shots. Gregor eagerly raised his rifle but Rex calmed the situation. When Ezra Bridger explained that they were sent by Ahsoka Tano, Rex welcomed them as friends. Later on, Gregor encouraged the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios to help the clones hunt for joopas. But he later reveals to Ezra that Zeb was in fact the bait, resulting in the Lasat being swallowed by the joopa, whom Gregor nicknamed Big Bongo. After managing to kill the joopa, Zeb was none too happy to learn that he was bait, but was calmed when Gregor pointed out that he helped catch Big Bongo.\n\nWhile settling down for dinner, Sabine discovered that one of the clones, Wolffe, had contacted the Empire. While Gregor and Rex had quickly trusted the Ghost crew, Wolffe wanted to protect his comrades from being persecuted by the Empire for harboring these rebels. When confronted, Wolffe admitted his wrongdoing and accepted Rex's reasoning that the rebels were their friends. After discovering and destroying an Imperial probe droid, the clones and rebels prepared for the impending Imperial assault. While Kanan tried to convince the clones to come with them, Rex was adamant that he and his comrades would stay behind to hold the Imperials back while the rebels escaped.\n\nThe rebels reluctantly departed on their auxiliary ship Phantom to rendezvous with the Ghost in space. Shortly later, a force of three AT-AT walkers led by the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus, a perennial foe of the crew of the Ghost. While outnumbered and outgunned, Gregor and his companions faced off against the Imperials in their lone AT-TE walker. At Ezra's urging, the rebels returned to rescue the clones and succeeded in defeating the Imperial force, forcing Kallus and his men to flee into the desert. After that, Gregor and his fellow clones saluted Kanan and his Padawan, and Rex agreed to join the Rebellion whilst Gregor and Wolffe stayed behind on Seelos, taking the remaining AT-AT walker for their new home.\n\n",

He was part of the team who attempted to rescue a trio of clone prisoners from an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser. Gregor piloted the ship while Echo, Fireball, and Nemec boarded the cruiser using a leech vessel. Gregor then docked the gunship onto the underside of the Imperial cruiser. Some TK troopers gathered at the round docking clamp airlock, and Gregor opened the hatch and threw in a stun grenade from below. After rescuing the clone prisoners, a Star Destroyer dropped out of hyperspace. A squad of V-wing starfighters pursued them, but the clones jumped to hyperspace and escaped.\n\nLater, Gregor had a rendezvous scheduled with Echo, a fellow member of the Underground. He was picked up in the Remora and brought back to Teth, where the Underground's main base of operations was. However, their base had been infiltrated, and Gregor watched Echo fly towards a rendezvous and rescue Rex, Howzer, and the Bad Batch.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Defection[]\n\nIn 19 BBY, the Clone Wars ended with the reorganization of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire. Gregor however did not carry out Order 66. Meanwhile, the new government had plans to phase out the clones and create a new army composed of recruits. As part of Project War-Mantle, a secret base was constructed on the Outer Rim planet Daro where the new \"TK troopers\" were to be trained. Gregor becomes an instructor at a facility on Daro where the next generation of Imperial troops is being trained. Fifty clone commandos, including Gregor, were dispatched to the base as trainers. However, Gregor quickly realized that he did not want to be a part of the new Empire. He escaped the base, but was hunted. He managed to plant a rescue beacon before being recaptured and imprisoned. The beacon sent a distress signal to Captain Rex, who had also deserted from the military when he declined to obey Order 66. Unable to go himself, Rex asked the Bad Batch, a group of fellow deserters, to carry out the rescue.\n\nGregor was in his cell on Cellblock 25 when he demanded that the trooper on guard duty be useful and bring him some food. The trooper retorted that he was a traitor, and Gregor snapped back that it was \"Captain Traitor\" as the trooper walked away, before muttering that the recruit was an \"Insubordinate pleb.\" Soon after that, the guards were neutralized by Hunter, Echo, and Tech as the Bad Batch approached Gregor's cell to set him free. Echo asked Gregor if he was CC-5576, and Gregor said it depended on who was asking. Tech said that Rex had sent them, and Gregor stood up and told them his name, saying they had to move out. As Hunter, Echo, Tech, and Gregor were making a swift escape from the base, Gregor took a hard shot to the chest by Scorch but survived and was evacuated from Daro at the cost of Hunter's capture and was left with information broker Ciddarin Scaleback on Ord Mantell. At some point his behavioral modification biochip was removed.\n\n",

Gregor tried to reclaim it and clumsily lunged, still not functioning to his abilities as a clone commando. Borkus easily knocked him down, but was overpowered by the droids of D-Squad. Gregor then donned his gear and prepared to help D-Squad storm the landing pad at the Separatist Rhydonium mining installation.\n\nGregor fired on the hordes of battle droids, clearing a path for his allies but leaving himself surrounded. As hostile forces closed in, Gregor advised Gascon and his forces take off, leaving him facing near-certain death. Gascon reluctantly agreed and departed as Gregor promised that he would make his way home. Gregor seemingly sacrificed himself after shooting containers of rhydonium to destroy the droids that would have shot down Gascon's fleeing shuttle.

Shortly thereafter, the Ghost docked with Senator Organa's corvette, the Tantive IV, where Jarrus returned the droids to the grateful senator\u2014though the rebels did not know who Organa was. In exchange for returning the droids, Organa provided them with a monetary reward. Jarrus disembarked, and R2-D2 gave Organa the recordings he had made on the rebel cell. Unknown to Jarrus, Organa was also part of fledging Rebel Alliance that communicated with and gave missions to rebel cells across the galaxy. As a result of the mission, Syndulla came into contact with Ahsoka Tano, one of the leaders of the movement. Tano, who identified herself only as \"Fulcrum,\" would often send the rebels missions to strike against the Empire.\n\nBridger's actions in saving Orrelios' life remained a source of contention between the two for a short time after the mission. Bridger frequently reminded Orrelios, with whom he shared quarters aboard the Ghost, of how he saved the Lasat's life from Agent Kallus, leading to fighting between the two bunkmates. The fighting intensified enough that Syndulla sent both of them on a supply run together, in order to get them off of the ship. During the supply run, the two inadvertently found themselves in a skirmish with Imperial forces and stole a TIE fighter, which they then used to attack a group of Imperial Troop Transports and rescue imprisoned civilians. The situation allowed Bridger and Orrelios, who had to work together to return to the Ghost, to settle their differences.\n\nThe crew encountered Organa again some time later, during a mission to rescue Jarrus from Imperial captivity; Jarrus had been captured by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who wanted to learn about the wider rebel movement. Chopper sent a message to \"Fulcrum\" and asked for reinforcements to assist them in their battle against the Empire in orbit of the planet Mustafar. A rebel fleet arrived in orbit of Mustafar and helped the crew escape from the Empire, marking the first time rebel cells began openly working together. Once the rebels were in hyperspace, Organa contacted the crew via hologram, where Syndulla revealed his true identity. The crew also met Tano and learned that she was Fulcrum.\n\nDuring the liberation of Lothal, Vizago openly regretted meeting Bridger that day because it had put him on the Empire's radar permanently.\n\n",

For the Battle of Sarrish, Gregor and his men were assigned to Foxtrot Group, an elite clone commando squad. The battle proved to be a great defeat for the Republic, and Gregor was forced to retreat into space. His transport ended up crash landing on Abafar. The crash caused him to suffer from amnesia, and he was rescued by a Sullustan named Borkus who took advantage of his condition to put him to work as a dishwasher in his business. Gregor regained his memories after Colonel Meebur Gascon and his unit identified him after their chance arrival in Pons Ora. He was thought to have been killed in an explosion trying to protect the colonel and his companions in a firefight against Separatist droids, but survived, although he sustained a traumatic brain injury.\n\nAfter the Clone Wars ended, Gregor was sent by the new Galactic Empire to a secret facility on the planet Daro, where he and other clone commandos were tasked with training the \"TK troopers\" which were to replace the clones. Gregor quickly realized he wanted out and sent a distress signal to the clone deserter Rex, who was unable to come himself but sent the Bad Batch, another group of deserters, to rescue him.\n\nFifteen years after the end of the Clone Wars, Gregor was still alive and was living in a modified AT-TE on Seelos with Captain Rex and Commander Wolffe. In 1 BBY, Gregor participated in the Liberation of Lothal, where the Lothal resistance group and the Spectres drove the Galactic Empire off Lothal once and for all. During the conflict, Gregor was killed, passing away after telling Rex that it was an honor to serve with him and to fight for a cause the clones actually chose to believe in.\n\n",

For the operation, the rebels traveled in two captured patrol transports. Using an unwilling Pryce, the rebels gained landing rights for the executive landing pad at the Dome. After a brief battle, the rebels managed to capture the command center and initiate a faux Protocol 13, causing the entire Imperial garrison on Lothal to evacuate aboard the Dome.\n\nBefore they could fire up the Dome's thrusters, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard his Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera and blocked their exit. Thrawn managed to force Ezra to meet him aboard the Chimaera by bombarding Lothal's Capital City. In Ezra's absence, the rebels embarked on Sabine's plan to recapture the power terminals powering up the Dome's deflector shield generator in order to protect Capital City from Imperial bombardment.\n\nGregor along with Zeb and Kallus were assigned to Team B, which was tasked with recapturing and restarting the south tower's power terminal. Despite fierce resistance, Team B managed to reach the south tower. There, they were attacked by Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh and several death troopers. While Zeb fought Rukh, Gregor and Kallus dealt with the others. During the battle, Gregor was shot in the right side of the chest by an Imperial weapons technician. Despite being mortally wounded, Gregor hurled the Imperial into the depths of the reactor chamber. He then told Kallus to get the shields back up. After reuniting with Rex, who had helped restore the north tower's power terminal, Gregor told Rex it was an honor to serve alongside him, saying that he was grateful to have died fighting for something that he chose to believe in before passing away. Rex stayed by his side until the end before returning to the fight. The rebels went on to liberate Lothal from Imperial rule at the end after the purrgil attached themselves to Thrawn's Star Destroyers and dragged them into hyperspace.\n\nRex wrote about Gregor in his book The Secrets of the Clone Troopers.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Personality and traits[]\n\nAs a clone commando, Gregor was trained in combat and could operate a blaster. Despite suffering a brief spell of amnesia, Gregor was loyal to the Galactic Republic and willing to put his life on the line for it. Since Gregor removed his control chip, he was unaffected by the transmission of Order 66. Due to the brain damage he had sustained during the Clone Wars, Gregor experienced occasional periods of insanity during the Age of the Empire. By the time he had defected from the Empire, his voice had gained a distinct rasp. When recruited by the Empire in training new recruits, Gregor was loyal to the Empire until he realized their ways was not what he signed up for and decided to defect from the Empire. Even when he was deemed a traitor by the Empire, Gregor openly remarked how proud he was for choosing to defect from the Empire.\n\nUnlike Wolffe, Gregor, along with Rex, was not hostile towards Kanan Jarrus and his rebel cell, the Spectres. He befriended Ezra Bridger and particularly Garazeb Orrelios, and convinced the rebels to accompany him on a hunt for joopas in return for Rex supplying them with information on former Republic military installations. Gregor and Wolffe were loyal to Rex and looked up to him as their leader, and they were willing to fight to the death in order to protect their new-found rebel friends from Imperial forces led by Agent Kallus. Gregor, Rex and Wolffe soon came to respect Kanan and Ezra after the rebels came to their aid and drove off Kallus' forces.\n\nWhile Gregor thought that Ezra's plan to liberate Lothal had a slim chance of success, his loyalty to Rex and Ezra led him to volunteer for the mission. Gregor was a competent fighter and soldier who was able to fight as part of a team. Before he died during the liberation of Lothal, Gregor stated to Rex that it was an honor to fight with him, and for what they chose to believe in.\n\nGregor was a human male who stood 1.83 meters tall, or 6 feet. He had black hair, brown eyes, and tan skin.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - The final stand[]\n\nAs the Phantom flew away from the AT-TE, Rex ordered Wolffe to turn them around, confronting the remaining two AT-ATs. Rex knew the battle could be their end, but they would at least go down like a clone should. They opened fire and charged at the opposing AT-ATs. Meanwhile, Bridger reminded Jarrus that he knew better than anyone that the clones would not give up and this fight would be their last.\n\nAs Wolffe continued to move the AT-TE towards the Empire, Kallus ordered his pilots to intensify their forward firepower, slowing the AT-TE down. After Wolffe informed Rex and Gregor he was going for all four of the AT-AT's legs, the Imperial Agent remarked the clones had lost their minds, and the clones quickly found themselves outflanked. At the same time, Jarrus told Bridger, Wren and Orrelios he had his problems with clones, but he did not want them to die.\n\nAs Rex closed his eyes, expecting a warrior's demise, the Phantom fired on the AT-AT's flank, with Jarrus, Bridger and Orrelios jumping onto the roof of the second AT-AT's cockpit. The Jedi used their lightsabers to cut a hole in the roof, with all three Rebels jumping inside the Empire's walker as Rex remarked it was just like the old days. The Spectres fired their commandeered AT-AT on Kallus's walker, while Rex fired on the walker's neck, causing the walker to collapse. In response, Kallus ordered his pilots to evacuate to their speeders.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - Navigating the storm[]\n\nAs the AT-TE walked through storm, Bridger said that they would not be able to hide in forever. Wren informed them that despite the AT-ATs being practically impervious to blasters, they had one weak spot: the neck. Gregor added on that one well-placed shot from the main gun should destroy the opposing walker. Meanwhile, Kallus ordered his AT-ATs to turn 30 degrees left, in hopes of flanking the AT-TE.\n\nShortly afterwards, Jarrus instructed Wolffe to stop the AT-TE, while Kallus confused on why his forces had not found the AT-TE, ordered his walkers to perform the pincer maneuver. Simultaneously, Jarrus ordered Wolffe to circle left, in double time, before making a full stop. The AT-TE was surrounded by the opposing AT-ATs. However, that worked to the clones and Spectres' advantage, as being in the middle of the Empire's walkers enabled them to get their shot. Gregor offered to take the shot, but Jarrus countered, instructing Bridger to take the shot. Bridger wanted Jarrus to shoot the cannon, but Rex agreed with Jarrus. He told Bridger they needed one Jedi manning the cannon, while the other stayed on the interior to lead them out of their current dilemma. Rex then told Wren to spot Bridger. The clone then tossed Bridger his helmet and told the young Jedi to hang on tight.\n\nAfter Bridger moved the main cannon to around point five, he reported that the targeting scope was useless. Jarrus reminded Bridger he was not going to see the exact position with his eyes, but the walker was there. Trusting himself, Bridger removed Rex's helmet and with his eyes closed, fired the cannon, destroying the neck of the AT-AT in front of them. The neck exploded, causing the walker to collapse. The clones took advantage of the opening, and Wolffe moved the AT-TE past their fallen opponent. However, in response, Kallus ordered his forces to focus their fire on the energy burst.\n\nAs the AT-TE exited the storm, Rex congratulated Bridger on his shot, then ordered him to get the Phantom moving as that was their only chance to escape. Jarrus reminded Bridger they had to bring Rex's intel back to the Rebellion. Before stepping onto the Phantom, Bridger told Jarrus the other part of their mission was to bring Rex back with them and they could not abandon the clones. In response, Rex told Bridger the clones were not being abandoned. Rather, they were covering the Spectres' escape. As Bridger stepped into the Phantom, Rex hopped onto the main cannon and told Bridger they were soldiers, and this is what they were born to do.\n\n",

While traveling the dusty plains of Seelos, the clones used their modified AT-TE as both a mobile home and a hunting platform. The AT-TE's interior was stripped of some of its military hardware to make room for bunk beds and a kitchen. Meanwhile, the walker's exterior had handrails and ladders installed to make room for balconies, walkways and decks. The railed walkways were adorned with lanterns and bug catchers. The clones also adapted the main mass-driver cannon into a rod and reel for catching joopas, which were large worm-like creatures native to Seelos. Even with the modifications, the main cannon could still fire projectiles.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - Tracking the lost commanders[]\n\nSometime after the decommissioning of the Clone Army in 18 BBY, Rex, Wolffe and Gregor retired to the dusty and remote planet Seelos, an Outer Rim world known for its harsh terrain and salty plains. While on the planet, they modified the AT-TE.\n\nIn 4 BBY, former Jedi Padawan and Force-Sensitive Outcast Ahsoka Tano informed the Spectres she had heard reports Rex was last seen on Seelos. She instructed the Spectres to head to the planet and use the head of an old T-series tactical droid to find him. After Sabine Wren repaired the head, giving it power, it scanned for a signal while simultaneously listing a set of digits over and over again: 7567. The Spectres followed the source of the signal to Rex's AT-TE, landing the Phantom in front of the walker. Rex walked out of the walker's modified sliding back door followed by Wolffe and Gregor. After Ezra Bridger asked him if the numbers '7567' meant anything to him, he replied that they were his birth number. Upon realizing the great commander they were sent to find was a clone, former Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarrus ignited his lightsaber. In response, Wolffe instinctively fired his DC-15A blaster rifle, until Rex ordered both Wolffe and Gregor to stand down. Rex reminded his clone brothers that it was the Empire, rather than the Jedi who had betrayed them. After Bridger explained that Rex's former Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano was the one who sent them to Seelos, he gained the clones trust, who in turn welcomed the Spectres onboard the walker, with the Spectres landing the Phantom on the walker's landing pad.\n\nAt first Jarrus continued to completely reject the clones's offer to help the Spectres. However, Rex soon after overheard Jarrus talking to Bridger about the clones's betrayal of him and his master. Rex informed Jarrus he did not betray his Jedi, as he, Wolffe and Gregor all had their control chips removed.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - The battle begins[]\n\nImmediately after the clones' conversation with Kallus, Wren ran inside the walker, informing the Rebels that the Empire had found them. As a TIE fighter fired on the walker, the Rebels ran outside to destroy the TIE, while Wolffe got the walker moving in evasive maneuvers. On the roof of the AT-TE, Garazeb Orrelios fired a Z-6 rotary blaster cannon and Wren fired a DC-15A blaster rifle, while Jarrus and Bridger protected the Phantom by repelling blasts with their lightsabers. After Rex told them they were wasting ammo, he gave Gregor a rocket launcher. The retired clone commander fired one rocket, which destroyed the TIE.\n\nWhen Rex walked over to the mass-driver cannon, Bridger apologized for being in the clone's seat. Instead of telling the Padawan to move, Rex informed Bridger the traverse controls were on his left, while the elevation was on his right. After Wren finished preparing the Phantom, Bridger insisted they could not leave the clones stranded on the AT-TE. However, before they could make any other decisions, they heard clanking of movement in the distance. Wolffe pointed in the horizon at three All Terrain Armored Transports.\n\nRex used a pair of macrobinoculars to study the opposing walkers. After reporting the AT-ATs had reinforced armor plating, heavy cannons and antipersonnel blasters, Rex instructed Wolffe to change the AT-TE's direction, so they could fight the upcoming battle on his terms. He then told Gregor to drop the Joopa so the walker could move quicker. Gregor let out a whine, then pressed the button on the control panel, dropping the Big Bongo.\n\nAfter the AT-TE turned around, Kallus informed his pilots that the clones could not outrun them. He instructed his walkers to fire at will on the AT-TE. Wren reported that the Phantom was in good enough form to fly. However, Rex retorted it was too late as the AT-ATs were already on top of them. Bridger agreed, and added on that the walkers would shoot them down. Therefore, the clones continued their current trajectory and walked into the storm. Rex informed the Spectres they would all be blind, except for Jarrus and Bridger as they were Jedi. Jarrus reluctantly agreed and ordered everyone inside the AT-TE.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - The Joopa and the probe[]\n\nLater, Gregor tasked Orrelios with catching an elusive joopa; a creature that was big enough to feed the clones for an entire year. Orrelios was harnessed to the modified main cannon's energy rod and reel and the Lasat walked along the planet's surface while he held his bo-rifle. As Orrelios continued to walk, Gregor revealed to Bridger and Wren that Orrelios was the bait, further angering Jarrus with the clones, who informed Gregor there was a difference between being the hunter and bait. However, it was too late for Orrelios to escape, as the Big Bongo attacked and swallowed Orrelios whole.\n\nAs Wolffe piloted the AT-TE, chasing after the Big Bongo, Rex instructed Wren to keep her eyes on the regulator next to the main gun. If the line broke, they would lose both the Joopa and Orrelios. Meanwhile, Gregor gave both Bridger and Jarrus an electrostaff. After they both sent two jolts down the line, Bridger jumped onto the each of the balcony to get a better angle for a third round but soon instructed Jarrus to lift him up. Once Wren finished fixing the regulator line, Bridger used both electrostaffs to fire one last jolt to the joopa, causing it to burst through the surface. Rex fired one shot from the main cannon, killing the giant beast.\n\nThat evening, after the clones latched the Big Bongo to the side of the walker, Wren discovered a dwarf probe droid inside the Phantom. The droid opened fire on her and damaged the Phantom's engines. Jarrus chased the droid across the underside of the walker and fired his blaster until the probe was out of his blaster's range. In response, Rex fired a DC-15A blaster rifle from one of the railed balconies of the AT-TE, destroying the droid, but only after it transmitted its recordings to the Empire.\n\nThe next day, the Spectres informed the clones they wanted to leave Seelos, before the Empire arrived. However, Wren reported to Jarrus that a storm was coming. Jarrus informed her that if Empire arrived before they left the surface, the storm would be the least of their problems. After the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer the Relentless arrived in the system, ISB Agent Alexsandr Kallus contacted Wolffe. The former clone commander attempted to convince Kallus the clones made a mistake and had not seen any Rebels. However, Kallus showed Wolffe and Rex the probe's recording of the Phantom on top of the AT-TE. Rex informed Kallus that he would need all his stormtroopers to beat them.\n\n",

Shortly thereafter, the Ghost docked with Senator Organa's corvette, the Tantive IV, where Jarrus returned the droids to the grateful senator\u2014though the rebels did not know who Organa was. In exchange for returning the droids, Organa provided them with a monetary reward. Jarrus disembarked, and R2-D2 gave Organa the recordings he had made on the rebel cell. Unknown to Jarrus, Organa was also part of fledging Rebel Alliance that communicated with and gave missions to rebel cells across the galaxy. As a result of the mission, Syndulla came into contact with Ahsoka Tano, one of the leaders of the movement. Tano, who identified herself only as \"Fulcrum,\" would often send the rebels missions to strike against the Empire.\n\nBridger's actions in saving Orrelios' life remained a source of contention between the two for a short time after the mission. Bridger frequently reminded Orrelios, with whom he shared quarters aboard the Ghost, of how he saved the Lasat's life from Agent Kallus, leading to fighting between the two bunkmates. The fighting intensified enough that Syndulla sent both of them on a supply run together, in order to get them off of the ship. During the supply run, the two inadvertently found themselves in a skirmish with Imperial forces and stole a TIE fighter, which they then used to attack a group of Imperial Troop Transports and rescue imprisoned civilians. The situation allowed Bridger and Orrelios, who had to work together to return to the Ghost, to settle their differences.\n\nThe crew encountered Organa again some time later, during a mission to rescue Jarrus from Imperial captivity; Jarrus had been captured by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who wanted to learn about the wider rebel movement. Chopper sent a message to \"Fulcrum\" and asked for reinforcements to assist them in their battle against the Empire in orbit of the planet Mustafar. A rebel fleet arrived in orbit of Mustafar and helped the crew escape from the Empire, marking the first time rebel cells began openly working together.

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - Tracking the lost commanders[]\n\nSometime after the decommissioning of the Clone Army in 18 BBY, Rex, Wolffe and Gregor retired to the dusty and remote planet Seelos, an Outer Rim world known for its harsh terrain and salty plains. While on the planet, they modified the AT-TE.\n\nIn 4 BBY, former Jedi Padawan and Force-Sensitive Outcast Ahsoka Tano informed the Spectres she had heard reports Rex was last seen on Seelos. She instructed the Spectres to head to the planet and use the head of an old T-series tactical droid to find him. After Sabine Wren repaired the head, giving it power, it scanned for a signal while simultaneously listing a set of digits over and over again: 7567. The Spectres followed the source of the signal to Rex's AT-TE, landing the Phantom in front of the walker. Rex walked out of the walker's modified sliding back door followed by Wolffe and Gregor. After Ezra Bridger asked him if the numbers '7567' meant anything to him, he replied that they were his birth number. Upon realizing the great commander they were sent to find was a clone, former Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarrus ignited his lightsaber. In response, Wolffe instinctively fired his DC-15A blaster rifle, until Rex ordered both Wolffe and Gregor to stand down. Rex reminded his clone brothers that it was the Empire, rather than the Jedi who had betrayed them. After Bridger explained that Rex's former Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano was the one who sent them to Seelos, he gained the clones trust, who in turn welcomed the Spectres onboard the walker, with the Spectres landing the Phantom on the walker's landing pad.\n\nAt first Jarrus continued to completely reject the clones's offer to help the Spectres. However, Rex soon after overheard Jarrus talking to Bridger about the clones's betrayal of him and his master. Rex informed Jarrus he did not betray his Jedi, as he, Wolffe and Gregor all had their control chips removed.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's AT-TE - The Joopa and the probe[]\n\nLater, Gregor tasked Orrelios with catching an elusive joopa; a creature that was big enough to feed the clones for an entire year. Orrelios was harnessed to the modified main cannon's energy rod and reel and the Lasat walked along the planet's surface while he held his bo-rifle. As Orrelios continued to walk, Gregor revealed to Bridger and Wren that Orrelios was the bait, further angering Jarrus with the clones, who informed Gregor there was a difference between being the hunter and bait. However, it was too late for Orrelios to escape, as the Big Bongo attacked and swallowed Orrelios whole.\n\nAs Wolffe piloted the AT-TE, chasing after the Big Bongo, Rex instructed Wren to keep her eyes on the regulator next to the main gun. If the line broke, they would lose both the Joopa and Orrelios. Meanwhile, Gregor gave both Bridger and Jarrus an electrostaff. After they both sent two jolts down the line, Bridger jumped onto the each of the balcony to get a better angle for a third round but soon instructed Jarrus to lift him up. Once Wren finished fixing the regulator line, Bridger used both electrostaffs to fire one last jolt to the joopa, causing it to burst through the surface. Rex fired one shot from the main cannon, killing the giant beast.\n\nThat evening, after the clones latched the Big Bongo to the side of the walker, Wren discovered a dwarf probe droid inside the Phantom. The droid opened fire on her and damaged the Phantom's engines. Jarrus chased the droid across the underside of the walker and fired his blaster until the probe was out of his blaster's range. In response, Rex fired a DC-15A blaster rifle from one of the railed balconies of the AT-TE, destroying the droid, but only after it transmitted its recordings to the Empire.\n\nThe next day, the Spectres informed the clones they wanted to leave Seelos, before the Empire arrived. However, Wren reported to Jarrus that a storm was coming. Jarrus informed her that if Empire arrived before they left the surface, the storm would be the least of their problems. After the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer the Relentless arrived in the system, ISB Agent Alexsandr Kallus contacted Wolffe. The former clone commander attempted to convince Kallus the clones made a mistake and had not seen any Rebels. However, Kallus showed Wolffe and Rex the probe's recording of the Phantom on top of the AT-TE. Rex informed Kallus that he would need all his stormtroopers to beat them.\n\n",

Wren informed them that despite the AT-ATs being practically impervious to blasters, they had one weak spot: the neck. Gregor added on that one well-placed shot from the main gun should destroy the opposing walker. Meanwhile, Kallus ordered his AT-ATs to turn 30 degrees left, in hopes of flanking the AT-TE.\n\nShortly afterwards, Jarrus instructed Wolffe to stop the AT-TE, while Kallus confused on why his forces had not found the AT-TE, ordered his walkers to perform the pincer maneuver. Simultaneously, Jarrus ordered Wolffe to circle left, in double time, before making a full stop. The AT-TE was surrounded by the opposing AT-ATs. However, that worked to the clones and Spectres' advantage, as being in the middle of the Empire's walkers enabled them to get their shot. Gregor offered to take the shot, but Jarrus countered, instructing Bridger to take the shot. Bridger wanted Jarrus to shoot the cannon, but Rex agreed with Jarrus. He told Bridger they needed one Jedi manning the cannon, while the other stayed on the interior to lead them out of their current dilemma. Rex then told Wren to spot Bridger. The clone then tossed Bridger his helmet and told the young Jedi to hang on tight.\n\nAfter Bridger moved the main cannon to around point five, he reported that the targeting scope was useless. Jarrus reminded Bridger he was not going to see the exact position with his eyes, but the walker was there. Trusting himself, Bridger removed Rex's helmet and with his eyes closed, fired the cannon, destroying the neck of the AT-AT in front of them. The neck exploded, causing the walker to collapse. The clones took advantage of the opening, and Wolffe moved the AT-TE past their fallen opponent. However, in response, Kallus ordered his forces to focus their fire on the energy burst.\n\nAs the AT-TE exited the storm, Rex congratulated Bridger on his shot, then ordered him to get the Phantom moving as that was their only chance to escape. Jarrus reminded Bridger they had to bring Rex's intel back to the Rebellion. Before stepping onto the Phantom, Bridger told Jarrus the other part of their mission was to bring Rex back with them and they could not abandon the clones. In response, Rex told Bridger the clones were not being abandoned. Rather, they were covering the Spectres' escape. As Bridger stepped into the Phantom, Rex hopped onto the main cannon and told Bridger they were soldiers, and this is what they were born to do.\n\n",

As a TIE fighter fired on the walker, the Rebels ran outside to destroy the TIE, while Wolffe got the walker moving in evasive maneuvers. On the roof of the AT-TE, Garazeb Orrelios fired a Z-6 rotary blaster cannon and Wren fired a DC-15A blaster rifle, while Jarrus and Bridger protected the Phantom by repelling blasts with their lightsabers. After Rex told them they were wasting ammo, he gave Gregor a rocket launcher. The retired clone commander fired one rocket, which destroyed the TIE.\n\nWhen Rex walked over to the mass-driver cannon, Bridger apologized for being in the clone's seat. Instead of telling the Padawan to move, Rex informed Bridger the traverse controls were on his left, while the elevation was on his right. After Wren finished preparing the Phantom, Bridger insisted they could not leave the clones stranded on the AT-TE. However, before they could make any other decisions, they heard clanking of movement in the distance. Wolffe pointed in the horizon at three All Terrain Armored Transports.\n\nRex used a pair of macrobinoculars to study the opposing walkers. After reporting the AT-ATs had reinforced armor plating, heavy cannons and antipersonnel blasters, Rex instructed Wolffe to change the AT-TE's direction, so they could fight the upcoming battle on his terms. He then told Gregor to drop the Joopa so the walker could move quicker. Gregor let out a whine, then pressed the button on the control panel, dropping the Big Bongo.\n\nAfter the AT-TE turned around, Kallus informed his pilots that the clones could not outrun them. He instructed his walkers to fire at will on the AT-TE. Wren reported that the Phantom was in good enough form to fly. However, Rex retorted it was too late as the AT-ATs were already on top of them. Bridger agreed, and added on that the walkers would shoot them down. Therefore, the clones continued their current trajectory and walked into the storm. Rex informed the Spectres they would all be blind, except for Jarrus and Bridger as they were Jedi. Jarrus reluctantly agreed and ordered everyone inside the AT-TE.\n\n",

Meanwhile, Bridger reminded Jarrus that he knew better than anyone that the clones would not give up and this fight would be their last.\n\nAs Wolffe continued to move the AT-TE towards the Empire, Kallus ordered his pilots to intensify their forward firepower, slowing the AT-TE down.

At one point, he befriended Clone Captain Rex. Gregor and his squad of clone commandos participated in the chaotic Battle of Sarrish that ended in a disastrous Republic defeat. After covering the retreat of his allies, Gregor was reported as missing in action after the battle and was considered to be dead. Despite his efforts, the rest of Gregor's squad perished in the battle.\n\nHowever, Gregor had survived the battle. His escape shuttle crashing on the planet Abafar in the town of Pons Ora, although he had not escaped unscathed. Gregor suffered from amnesia after a traumatic brain injury and, unable to remember that he was a soldier of the Republic Army, sought work and was given a job working as a dishwasher and cleaner at the Power Sliders diner by the Sullustan Borkus for nothing more than room and board. He worked at the diner for some time and, due to his amnesia, never realized who he was. Borkus claimed his armor, weapons, and other gear and kept it, never telling Gregor who he was.\n\nAfter Colonel Meebur Gascon and his team of droids crash-landed on Abafar as they attempted to return to Republic lines after a mission, they eventually made their way into the town. As Gascon attempted to find food, he ran into Gregor behind the diner. Gregor offered him food but was confused when Gascon attempted to tell him that he was a clone. Gascon began to think that Gregor was working undercover, and a disoriented Gregor left Gascon and later went home.\n\nLater, Gregor returned home from work and was greeted by a hologram of his old friend Rex. Shocked, Gregor listened as Gascon explained who he was. When R2-D2 scanned Gregor's arm to learn his designation, CC-5576-39, Gascon read through Gregor's report, which listed him as missing in action. Gregor began to remember who he was, recalling the wounded and dying clones from the battle. Gascon convinced Gregor to search for his gear and help them leave the planet and complete their mission.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Helping the Spectres[]\n\nIn the years after the Galactic Empire's creation, Gregor was living with Captain Rex and Commander Wolffe, who had also removed their chips, in a modified AT-TE on the planet Seelos. Unfortunately, due to his two traumatic brain injuries, he suffered from episodes of mild insanity.\n\nFour years prior to the Battle of Yavin, the clones were approached by the crew of the Ghost, who were looking for information on abandoned military installations for the rebel network. When Kanan Jarrus identified them as clones, Wolffe, in turn, recognized him as a Jedi and let off a few shots. Gregor eagerly raised his rifle but Rex calmed the situation. When Ezra Bridger explained that they were sent by Ahsoka Tano, Rex welcomed them as friends. Later on, Gregor encouraged the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios to help the clones hunt for joopas. But he later reveals to Ezra that Zeb was in fact the bait, resulting in the Lasat being swallowed by the joopa, whom Gregor nicknamed Big Bongo. After managing to kill the joopa, Zeb was none too happy to learn that he was bait, but was calmed when Gregor pointed out that he helped catch Big Bongo.\n\nWhile settling down for dinner, Sabine discovered that one of the clones, Wolffe, had contacted the Empire. While Gregor and Rex had quickly trusted the Ghost crew, Wolffe wanted to protect his comrades from being persecuted by the Empire for harboring these rebels. When confronted, Wolffe admitted his wrongdoing and accepted Rex's reasoning that the rebels were their friends. After discovering and destroying an Imperial probe droid, the clones and rebels prepared for the impending Imperial assault. While Kanan tried to convince the clones to come with them, Rex was adamant that he and his comrades would stay behind to hold the Imperials back while the rebels escaped.\n\nThe rebels reluctantly departed on their auxiliary ship Phantom to rendezvous with the Ghost in space. Shortly later, a force of three AT-AT walkers led by the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus, a perennial foe of the crew of the Ghost. While outnumbered and outgunned, Gregor and his companions faced off against the Imperials in their lone AT-TE walker. At Ezra's urging, the rebels returned to rescue the clones and succeeded in defeating the Imperial force, forcing Kallus and his men to flee into the desert. After that, Gregor and his fellow clones saluted Kanan and his Padawan, and Rex agreed to join the Rebellion whilst Gregor and Wolffe stayed behind on Seelos, taking the remaining AT-AT walker for their new home.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Defection[]\n\nIn 19 BBY, the Clone Wars ended with the reorganization of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire. Gregor however did not carry out Order 66. Meanwhile, the new government had plans to phase out the clones and create a new army composed of recruits. As part of Project War-Mantle, a secret base was constructed on the Outer Rim planet Daro where the new \"TK troopers\" were to be trained. Gregor becomes an instructor at a facility on Daro where the next generation of Imperial troops is being trained. Fifty clone commandos, including Gregor, were dispatched to the base as trainers. However, Gregor quickly realized that he did not want to be a part of the new Empire. He escaped the base, but was hunted. He managed to plant a rescue beacon before being recaptured and imprisoned. The beacon sent a distress signal to Captain Rex, who had also deserted from the military when he declined to obey Order 66. Unable to go himself, Rex asked the Bad Batch, a group of fellow deserters, to carry out the rescue.\n\nGregor was in his cell on Cellblock 25 when he demanded that the trooper on guard duty be useful and bring him some food. The trooper retorted that he was a traitor, and Gregor snapped back that it was \"Captain Traitor\" as the trooper walked away, before muttering that the recruit was an \"Insubordinate pleb.\" Soon after that, the guards were neutralized by Hunter, Echo, and Tech as the Bad Batch approached Gregor's cell to set him free. Echo asked Gregor if he was CC-5576, and Gregor said it depended on who was asking. Tech said that Rex had sent them, and Gregor stood up and told them his name, saying they had to move out. As Hunter, Echo, Tech, and Gregor were making a swift escape from the base, Gregor took a hard shot to the chest by Scorch but survived and was evacuated from Daro at the cost of Hunter's capture and was left with information broker Ciddarin Scaleback on Ord Mantell. At some point his behavioral modification biochip was removed.\n\n",

For the Battle of Sarrish, Gregor and his men were assigned to Foxtrot Group, an elite clone commando squad. The battle proved to be a great defeat for the Republic, and Gregor was forced to retreat into space. His transport ended up crash landing on Abafar. The crash caused him to suffer from amnesia, and he was rescued by a Sullustan named Borkus who took advantage of his condition to put him to work as a dishwasher in his business. Gregor regained his memories after Colonel Meebur Gascon and his unit identified him after their chance arrival in Pons Ora. He was thought to have been killed in an explosion trying to protect the colonel and his companions in a firefight against Separatist droids, but survived, although he sustained a traumatic brain injury.\n\nAfter the Clone Wars ended, Gregor was sent by the new Galactic Empire to a secret facility on the planet Daro, where he and other clone commandos were tasked with training the \"TK troopers\" which were to replace the clones. Gregor quickly realized he wanted out and sent a distress signal to the clone deserter Rex, who was unable to come himself but sent the Bad Batch, another group of deserters, to rescue him.\n\nFifteen years after the end of the Clone Wars, Gregor was still alive and was living in a modified AT-TE on Seelos with Captain Rex and Commander Wolffe. In 1 BBY, Gregor participated in the Liberation of Lothal, where the Lothal resistance group and the Spectres drove the Galactic Empire off Lothal once and for all. During the conflict, Gregor was killed, passing away after telling Rex that it was an honor to serve with him and to fight for a cause the clones actually chose to believe in.\n\n",

        "content": "# Gregor - Personality and traits[]\n\nAs a clone commando, Gregor was trained in combat and could operate a blaster. Despite suffering a brief spell of amnesia, Gregor was loyal to the Galactic Republic and willing to put his life on the line for it. Since Gregor removed his control chip, he was unaffected by the transmission of Order 66. Due to the brain damage he had sustained during the Clone Wars, Gregor experienced occasional periods of insanity during the Age of the Empire. By the time he had defected from the Empire, his voice had gained a distinct rasp. When recruited by the Empire in training new recruits, Gregor was loyal to the Empire until he realized their ways was not what he signed up for and decided to defect from the Empire. Even when he was deemed a traitor by the Empire, Gregor openly remarked how proud he was for choosing to defect from the Empire.\n\nUnlike Wolffe, Gregor, along with Rex, was not hostile towards Kanan Jarrus and his rebel cell, the Spectres. He befriended Ezra Bridger and particularly Garazeb Orrelios, and convinced the rebels to accompany him on a hunt for joopas in return for Rex supplying them with information on former Republic military installations. Gregor and Wolffe were loyal to Rex and looked up to him as their leader, and they were willing to fight to the death in order to protect their new-found rebel friends from Imperial forces led by Agent Kallus. Gregor, Rex and Wolffe soon came to respect Kanan and Ezra after the rebels came to their aid and drove off Kallus' forces.\n\nWhile Gregor thought that Ezra's plan to liberate Lothal had a slim chance of success, his loyalty to Rex and Ezra led him to volunteer for the mission. Gregor was a competent fighter and soldier who was able to fight as part of a team. Before he died during the liberation of Lothal, Gregor stated to Rex that it was an honor to fight with him, and for what they chose to believe in.\n\nGregor was a human male who stood 1.83 meters tall, or 6 feet. He had black hair, brown eyes, and tan skin.\n\n",

For the operation, the rebels traveled in two captured patrol transports. Using an unwilling Pryce, the rebels gained landing rights for the executive landing pad at the Dome. After a brief battle, the rebels managed to capture the command center and initiate a faux Protocol 13, causing the entire Imperial garrison on Lothal to evacuate aboard the Dome.\n\nBefore they could fire up the Dome's thrusters, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard his Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera and blocked their exit. Thrawn managed to force Ezra to meet him aboard the Chimaera by bombarding Lothal's Capital City. In Ezra's absence, the rebels embarked on Sabine's plan to recapture the power terminals powering up the Dome's deflector shield generator in order to protect Capital City from Imperial bombardment.\n\nGregor along with Zeb and Kallus were assigned to Team B, which was tasked with recapturing and restarting the south tower's power terminal. Despite fierce resistance, Team B managed to reach the south tower. There, they were attacked by Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh and several death troopers. While Zeb fought Rukh, Gregor and Kallus dealt with the others. During the battle, Gregor was shot in the right side of the chest by an Imperial weapons technician. Despite being mortally wounded, Gregor hurled the Imperial into the depths of the reactor chamber. He then told Kallus to get the shields back up. After reuniting with Rex, who had helped restore the north tower's power terminal, Gregor told Rex it was an honor to serve alongside him, saying that he was grateful to have died fighting for something that he chose to believe in before passing away. Rex stayed by his side until the end before returning to the fight. The rebels went on to liberate Lothal from Imperial rule at the end after the purrgil attached themselves to Thrawn's Star Destroyers and dragged them into hyperspace.\n\nRex wrote about Gregor in his book The Secrets of the Clone Troopers.\n\n",

On Kanan telling him that the crew, in that case, is glad to be able to return them, Organa notes that \"the simplest gesture of kindness can fill a galaxy with hope,\" which the confused Kanan recognizes as a Jedi saying. Organa, however, doesn't give him time to dwell on it too hard, smoothly bidding him farewell with a smile. With Kanan out of earshot, Organa checks with C-3PO that he did not mention his name and gives him permission to shut down in order to rest from a hectic day.

The goals of the Clone Underground included helping disillusioned clone troopers escape the Imperial Military and fighting the Empire in the name of the fallen Galactic Republic. By 18 BBY, the network had several clone contacts within the Empire working as informants, such as Slip until his death. The group also had a sympathetic senator in the Imperial Senate itself, Riyo Chuchi. The network managed to rescue multiple clones throughout its history, including Gregor, Fireball, Nemec, Captain Howzer, and two other clone troopers from his squad. Additionally, Clone Force 99 member and former Advanced Recon Commando, Echo, joined the network following the passing of the Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill. Rex maintained contact with and was occasionally assisted by the rest of Clone Force 99, which included Hunter, Omega, Wrecker, Tech, and Crosshair.\n\nThe network possessed a ship known as the Remora that was equipped with a detachable leech vessel, as well as several captured Rho-class transport shuttles. The Clone Underground helped rescue clone troopers as per their bond as brothers and conducted other actions that harried the spread of the fledgling Galactic Empire. The network's hideout was on the Wild Space planet of Teth within the ruins of an abandoned B'omarr Order Monastery, though they also made use of a repair shop on Coruscant.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's BTL-B Y-wing fighter-bomber - Order 66[]\n\nThe Y-wing was utilized by the Galactic Republic Navy late in the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. In 19 BBY, the Y-wing was part of the onboard complement of the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal when it was present above the planet Mandalore shortly after the end of the recent siege, in which the Mandalore resistance and forces of the Grand Army of the Republic had defeated the Shadow Collective and captured its leader, the rogue Sith Lord Maul. The Tribunal, under the command of former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Clone Commander Rex, was to deliver Maul to the Jedi High Council on Coruscant. At the time, the Y-wing was docked in the Tribunal's repair bay above an exit in the capital ship's bottom hull, and was the only ship in the repair bay not currently undergoing maintenance.\n\nHowever, shortly after the Tribunal jumped into hyperspace, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious issued Order 66, a command which compelled the clone troopers of the Grand Army to turn on and execute their Jedi Generals through inhibitor chips implanted in their brains. Tano was forced to go on the run onboard the ship, releasing Maul from the detention level as a distraction before freeing Rex from the brainwashing with the help of three astromech droids, including her old unit R7-A7. Once Rex's chip had been removed, he and Tano attempted to escape the Star Destroyer. However, the escape pods had been destroyed because of orders Rex had given while he was brainwashed, so they were forced to head for the hangar, hoping to steal a shuttle.\n\nMaul, left to his own devices, destroyed the Tribunal's hyperdrive, setting the cruiser out of hyperspace and onto a collision course with a moon. When Tano and Rex reached the hangar control room, they discovered both that the starship was doomed and that the clone troopers, led by Clone Lieutenant ARC trooper CT-5597 \"Jesse\", had assembled in the hangar to try and prevent any escapes. Noticing that Jesse and his men were standing atop the lifts to the repair bay, Tano concocted a plan to make it easier for her and Rex to reach the shuttle by sending most of the clones to the maintenance level. However, while Tano and Rex were fighting off the remaining clones in the hangar, Maul entered and stole the Nu-class attack/transport shuttle in bay 12 that they had intended to take. Tano was unable to prevent Maul from escaping, being forced to let him go as Rex was in danger of being overwhelmed by clone reinforcements that had arrived. She cut a hole in the floor to bring herself and Rex down to the repair bay, with droids RG-G1 and CH-33P launching the lifts back up before the clones destroyed them.\n\nTano and Rex attempted to find another ship to escape in, but discovered that almost all of the ships in the repair bay were under maintenance and thus unflyable. After taking out some clones that remained in the bay, Tano spotted the Y-wing in its docking port and pointed it out to Rex. They repelled some more clones before running towards the starfighter, but the lifts began to descend as Jesse's forces had gained control of them. As Tano began to defend herself against their blaster fire, Rex continued running towards the Y-wing, shouting for Tano to get him over to the ship. When he reached the edge of the hole, Tano Force pushed him across the gap and onto the fighter, where he managed to get a grip on it as Tano turned her attention back to the clones' fire. Climbing onto the bomber, Rex stunned a few of the attacking clones before opening the cockpit hatch and getting inside.\n\nAt that point, the Tribunal had entered the moon's atmosphere, and the command bridge exploded, killing the bridge officers and setting the capital ship completely out of control. The clones and Tano lost their footing, and Rex, seeing the situation, took the pilot's seat and shouted for Tano to get over to the Y-wing. Tano leapt for the starfighter, but it was knocked free of its mooring and blown into the trail of debris flowing behind the doomed Star Destroyer, leaving Tano in freefall. Rex managed to activate the Y-wing after a brief struggle, getting it under control and flying it back towards the Tribunal. He looked around for Tano, opening the gunner's hatch when he finally found her. Tano grabbed the hatch, but lost her grip and was set flying again. As Rex followed her in the fighter, she slowed herself down by running along one of the Tribunal's dislodged ion engines, and was able to successfully board the Y-wing after leaping off of it. Rex maneuvered the starfighter away from the ongoing crash, and he and Tano watched the Tribunal sink beneath the clouds.\n\nTano and Rex landed the Y-wing at the crash site, where they salvaged the remains of R7-A7 and other useful items, as well as burying the dead, as no one onboard the Tribunal had survived. As Tano spent a final moment at the graveyard, Rex walked back to the fighter and stowed a shovel he had used in a rack on its side, before turning back to look at Tano.\n\n",

The two Jedi hid inside a box while the droid tanks moved around them. As they made their way to the source of the shield, Tano tripped on a sensor antenna, accidentally activating a batch of Separatist retail droids. While Skywalker was occupied with the droids, Tano began to place charges around the generator. As she was planting charges, a battle droid snuck up behind her, but Tano noticed it and sliced it in half. The battle droid's body rolled over more sensors and activated additional retail droids. With her master pinned down by the horde, Tano noticed a piece of wall behind him with a convenient hole right where Skywalker was positioned. She used the Force to push the wall down, crushing the droids around her master.\n\nMeanwhile, in the city, Kenobi tricked Separatist General Whorm Loathsom, stalling for time until the shield blew up. Then, Kenobi took the Separatist General hostage. When the battle was over, Skywalker noted how reckless his new Padawan was, saying that she might not have made it as Kenobi's Padawan.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Childhood\n\nIn 36 BBY, Ahsoka Tano was born on the planet Shili to the Togrutas Pav-ti and Nak-il Tano. Early in her life, Tano was taken on a journey by her mother, who taught her about life and death. During that period, the young girl encountered a raxshir feline, which she reached out to without fear. She proceeded to ride atop the animal to return home. Upon her return, the elder Togruta Gantika realized the infant was Force-sensitive and declared that she would be a Jedi. When Tano was three years old, she was discovered by Jedi Master Plo Koon among her people on Shili after her natural ability to sense the intentions and feelings of others had marked her as Force-sensitive.\n\nAround the same time, however, Tano was nearly enslaved by an impostor, who intercepted the signal to the Jedi Order and hoped to use her powers for their own ends. Being unable to properly explain to the village elders the danger she knew the impostor posed, Tano's fellow villagers held scorn towards her when she refused to demonstrate her Force powers, but the impostor's plan was ultimately thwarted. Although the impostor had scared the young Tano, she trusted Koon instantly, and he taught her how to breathe slowly to calm herself. Afterward, she was accepted into the Jedi Order, beginning her new life after Koon brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where, like all Jedi of her era, she was raised. Training as a Jedi Initiate restored her self-confidence after the fear caused by the impostor impacted it, and the life of a Jedi became the only life she ever knew.\n\nAt some point, Tano traveled to the Jedi Temple on the ice planet Ilum to acquire a kyber crystal for a lightsaber, feeling the crystals, albeit without knowing that was what she sensed, as soon as the Jedi starship came out of hyperspace. She entered into the temple's cave after Grand Master Yoda told her she would know her crystal when she found it. As the opening to the cave slowly closed as the sun of Asar set, she urgently looked for her crystal until she calmed herself, thinking back on Yoda's words and only then seeing its light. Excited and ready to leave, she quickly made her way out of the cave with the tool for which she could build her own lightsaber. Although her visit to Ilum had overall been unremarkable, her decision to trust Yoda's teaching restored her ability to trust others after it was impacted by the false Jedi. From there, she would construct said lightsaber using the kyber crystal under the tutelage of Jedi architect droid Huyang, who fussed over her shoulder as she worked on it. At another point, Yoda taught her that she could sometimes find something she was not looking for in a situation.\n\nDuring her time at the Jedi Temple, Professor Huyang would regale her with the History of the Galaxy, Parts One, Two and Three, of which she considered part one the best.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Becoming Skywalker's Padawan\n\nAt the age of fourteen, mere months after the First Battle of Geonosis and the beginning of the Clone Wars, Tano was assigned to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to learn the ways of the Force as his apprentice on the orders of Yoda. Her training had been accelerated due to the galactic conflict that overshadowed her apprenticeship. Having been granted the rank of Padawan, which made her a Jedi Commander under the Jedi Military Integration Act, she demonstrated an eagerness to prove herself worthy to be his apprentice. Yoda did this to alleviate Skywalker's fear and inability to lose loved ones, as he believed that by becoming a teacher, Skywalker would develop emotionally and understand that his excessive bonding to those he cared about was unnecessary once Tano was ready to go off on her own.\n\nThe Jedi Council finally sent Tano on her first mission to the planet Christophsis in order to meet her new mentor and inform Kenobi and him that they were needed back at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. However, after arriving on the planet moments after a wave of Separatist forces pulled back and giving that message to the two, she learned that the Republic had in fact failed to take the planet as the Jedi on Coruscant had believed, leaving the generals and their forces trapped and outnumbered as the battle dragged on. Kenobi introduced himself, presuming that she was his new Padawan learner. She corrected him, insisting that Master Yoda specifically assigned her to Skywalker, who was shocked to hear the news due to the fact that he had spoken adamantly against the idea of taking on a Padawan learner. Despite Kenobi's confusion, he accepted that having a Padawan would be good for Skywalker, who vehemently disagreed.\n\nMeanwhile, the droid army set up a deflector shield that would block the Republic artillery bombardment that earlier halted their advancements. Skywalker took Tano to check on Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" who was also confused by Tano's presence, referencing Skywalker's earlier affirmation against taking on a Padawan learner. Tano stood up for herself, saying that Yoda believed she was capable and that she would prove it. As Skywalker went on ahead, Tano asked Rex if she outranked him, to which Rex responded that experience outranked any kind of designated command. However, Tano just responded that she was eager to get some.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex's BTL-B Y-wing fighter-bomber - Order 66[]\n\nThe Y-wing was utilized by the Galactic Republic Navy late in the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. In 19 BBY, the Y-wing was part of the onboard complement of the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal when it was present above the planet Mandalore shortly after the end of the recent siege, in which the Mandalore resistance and forces of the Grand Army of the Republic had defeated the Shadow Collective and captured its leader, the rogue Sith Lord Maul. The Tribunal, under the command of former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Clone Commander Rex, was to deliver Maul to the Jedi High Council on Coruscant. At the time, the Y-wing was docked in the Tribunal's repair bay above an exit in the capital ship's bottom hull, and was the only ship in the repair bay not currently undergoing maintenance.\n\nHowever, shortly after the Tribunal jumped into hyperspace, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious issued Order 66, a command which compelled the clone troopers of the Grand Army to turn on and execute their Jedi Generals through inhibitor chips implanted in their brains. Tano was forced to go on the run onboard the ship, releasing Maul from the detention level as a distraction before freeing Rex from the brainwashing with the help of three astromech droids, including her old unit R7-A7. Once Rex's chip had been removed, he and Tano attempted to escape the Star Destroyer. However, the escape pods had been destroyed because of orders Rex had given while he was brainwashed, so they were forced to head for the hangar, hoping to steal a shuttle.\n\nMaul, left to his own devices, destroyed the Tribunal's hyperdrive, setting the cruiser out of hyperspace and onto a collision course with a moon. When Tano and Rex reached the hangar control room, they discovered both that the starship was doomed and that the clone troopers, led by Clone Lieutenant ARC trooper CT-5597 \"Jesse\", had assembled in the hangar to try and prevent any escapes. Noticing that Jesse and his men were standing atop the lifts to the repair bay, Tano concocted a plan to make it easier for her and Rex to reach the shuttle by sending most of the clones to the maintenance level. However, while Tano and Rex were fighting off the remaining clones in the hangar, Maul entered and stole the Nu-class attack/transport shuttle in bay 12 that they had intended to take. Tano was unable to prevent Maul from escaping, being forced to let him go as Rex was in danger of being overwhelmed by clone reinforcements that had arrived. She cut a hole in the floor to bring herself and Rex down to the repair bay, with droids RG-G1 and CH-33P launching the lifts back up before the clones destroyed them.\n\nTano and Rex attempted to find another ship to escape in, but discovered that almost all of the ships in the repair bay were under maintenance and thus unflyable. After taking out some clones that remained in the bay, Tano spotted the Y-wing in its docking port and pointed it out to Rex. They repelled some more clones before running towards the starfighter, but the lifts began to descend as Jesse's forces had gained control of them. As Tano began to defend herself against their blaster fire, Rex continued running towards the Y-wing, shouting for Tano to get him over to the ship. When he reached the edge of the hole, Tano Force pushed him across the gap and onto the fighter, where he managed to get a grip on it as Tano turned her attention back to the clones' fire. Climbing onto the bomber, Rex stunned a few of the attacking clones before opening the cockpit hatch and getting inside.",

After the Clone Wars, she helped establish a network of various rebel cells against the Galactic Empire. Tano was discovered on her homeworld of Shili by Jedi Master Plo Koon, who brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to receive Jedi training. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda assigned the young Tano to be the Padawan learner of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who nicknamed her \"Snips\" when she joined him at the Battle of Christophsis. Whereas Tano was eager to prove herself, Skywalker had a reputation for recklessness, and they had a rather difficult start as master and apprentice. Yet they worked together to rescue Rotta, the son of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and returned Rotta to his father, thus facilitating a crucial alliance between the Hutt Clan and the Galactic Republic.\n\nAs a commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, Tano found a mentor in Clone Captain Rex of the 501st Legion, with whom she and Skywalker collaborated to lead frontline campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In her first command position at the Battle of Ryloth, Tano disobeyed orders and lost her entire squadron of pilots, but she rebounded and helped secure a victory at Ryloth. Her assignments pitted her against a variety of opponents, from General Grievous and Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress to bounty hunters such as Cad Bane and Aurra Sing. Over time, she matured into a respected leader, contributing to key Republic victories like the Second Battle of Geonosis and the Battle of Mon Cala. Tano even died during a series of events on Mortis, but the Daughter, a Force wielder who personified the light side, sacrificed herself to resurrect Tano and bring her back to life.\n\nTano gained much experience on and beyond the war front, leading a group of Jedi younglings to revolt against their Trandoshan captors, helping rescue a colony of Togruta from enslavement by the Zygerrian Slave Empire, and serving as an advisor to the Onderon rebels\u2014with her close friend, Lux Bonteri, among them\u2014as they liberated their world from the Confederacy. In a stark turn of events, Tano was framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar and other homicides, and she escaped into the Coruscant Underworld to clear her name. Though she formed an unlikely alliance with Asajj Ventress, she was detained by Republic forces and was consequently barred from the Jedi Order. Ultimately, Skywalker uncovered the true culprit, Tano's friend, and fellow Padawan Barriss Offee, and prevented his former apprentice from being convicted of sedition. Nevertheless, the ordeal dislodged Tano's faith in the Jedi. She refused the Jedi High Council's offer to rejoin the Order, instead departing in search of a new path. Tano briefly returned to lead Republic forces during the Siege of Mandalore and faced Maul and his allies. Order 66 was enacted shortly after the Sith Lord's capture and Tano alongside Rex, after freeing Rex from the control of Order 66, escaped the rest of her 501st division. Faking her death, she was forced into hiding.\n\nAfter the Galactic Empire came to power, Tano went into hiding on Thabeska and Raada disguised as \"Ashla.\" Following the evacuation of Raada, Tano joined Senator Bail Organa's growing rebel movement. She became the manager of his intelligence network and adopted the codename \"Fulcrum.\" As Fulcrum, Tano provided intelligence to various rebel factions including Hera Syndulla's Spectres rebel cell. Tano took a particular interest in Syndulla's rebels because one of their members, a Jedi named Kanan Jarrus, had begun to train his own Padawan, Ezra Bridger. In addition, Tano's efforts against the Empire brought her into contact with the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader\u2014who, unknown to her, was actually her former master, Anakin Skywalker\u2014as well as the Imperial Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, but it also gave her the chance to reunite with Rex. Following the mission to Malachor, Tano became lost to the rubble and shadows of the Sith temple and was believed by many, including Jarrus and Bridger, to have perished during a duel with Darth Vader.\n\nHowever, Tano was unexpectedly saved from Vader's wrath by a future Ezra Bridger, who pulled her through a portal into the World Between Worlds, a mystical plane of the Force connecting all time and space. After a confrontation with Darth Sidious, who desired access to the dimension, Tano returned to her time, promising Bridger that she would find him once she returned. After the end of the Galactic Civil War, Tano joined Sabine Wren in her quest to find the missing Bridger, who had disappeared during the Liberation of Lothal, and trained Wren in the ways of the Jedi until parting ways. Tano later journeyed to the city of Calodan on the forest planet Corvus looking for information on the location of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had disappeared alongside Bridger, from Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth. Needing to rescue the city from Elsbeth's rule, she allied herself with the Mandalorian Din Djarin, who had been on a quest to bring the Force-sensitive youngling Grogu to the Jedi. After freeing Calodan, Tano refused to train Grogu and directed Djarin to the planet Tython instead. She later visited Luke Skywalker at his new Jedi Temple and, when Skywalker found Grogu in his care following a summons from the seeing stone, oversaw his training of the child temporarily.\n\nFaced with Thrawn's return, Tano returned to Lothal and enlisted Wren's help once again in finding Bridger and the missing Grand Admiral. Decades after Tano began her search, her voice joined a multitude of Jedi spirits to guide the young Jedi Rey, the granddaughter of a resurrected Darth Sidious, during the final battle of the First Order-Resistance War. Ahsoka inspired Rey to stand up to Sidious and destroy him once and for all.\n\n",

Landing the starfighter in a river valley near the city of Theed, Rex stayed with the ship while Tano was gone. At the funeral, Tano was spotted by Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa, who was surprised that she had come despite the danger. When Organa asked her where her ship was, she told him it was by the river.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Battle of Teth and rescuing Jabba's son\n\nAfter the Battle of Christophsis, Skywalker and his new apprentice were dispatched to find and rescue Jabba the Hutt's missing son Rotta, who was captured by Separatist forces and brought to the planet Teth. Rescuing Rotta was critical to ensure trade and shipping routes for the Republic through Hutt Space in the Outer Rim Territories.\n\nAs Skywalker communicated with the scouts who had been sent to Teth, Tano quickly became friendly with the clones, telling them about her rescue of Skywalker on Christophsis. Skywalker approached them and told them that it would be impossible to land at the B'omarr Order Monastery. As Rex sent the men to their positions, Skywalker told Tano to remain humble, who replied that she was trying to keep the men inspired.\n\nRepublic forces were forced to land below the monastery, with Tano riding in a LAAT/i gunship with Skywalker, Rex, and several other troopers. After landing, their forces began to scale the mountain with AT-TE walkers and ascension cables where the building was located. Skywalker led the charge and Tano stood on top of a walker and deflected oncoming laser fire. The climb proved to be a challenge, but the Jedi and clones eventually reached the top of the mountain.\n\nAfter securing the outer perimeter, they discovered a caretaker droid called 4-A7, who revealed the location of the captured Hutt. Skywalker and Tano went to look for him and were forced to fight several enemy battle droids, but eventually found the cell where the Hutt was located. Rotta turned out to be just a Huttlet. Meanwhile, 4-A7, who actually served the Separatists and Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress, recorded the Jedi's speech. Ventress transmitted the recording to her master, Count Dooku, who gave the \"evidence\" to Jabba that the Jedi were behind the kidnapping. Dooku assured Jabba that he would sent his army to \"rescue\" Rotta, intending to gain Jabba's favor for safe passage through the system.\n\nWith the incoming droid army on their way and the little Huttlet sick, the Jedi had to look for another way out to bring the kidnapped Hutt back to Tatooine. On their way out, Ventress had arrived and eventually located the two and engaged them in battle. After a brief duel, they escaped on a can-cell to a nearby hangar, followed by Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, to where a ship, the Twilight, was berthed. Once on the other platform, they encountered 4-A7 once again. However, it became obvious the droid was a spy when three battle droids came out of the ship. The Jedi destroyed the droids and hijacked the ship.\n\nWhile on the escape, Master Kenobi and Republic reinforcements had arrived with Kenobi engaging in a duel with Ventress. Now on the ship, Skywalker and Tano attempted to land on a Republic Star Destroyer, but the cruiser's hangar was destroyed, forcing the Jedi to make their way to Tatooine on their own. As the two jumped to hyperspace, Ventress and Kenobi sensed their withdrawal. Kenobi, knowing that Ventress had failed her mission and that her master would be displeased to learn that, managed to gain the upper hand over Ventress until she boarded a Vulture droid to escape capture.\n\nMeanwhile, Tano and Skywalker found medicine for the Huttlet, which saved his life as they made their way back to Jabba's palace on Tatooine. However, as they approached Tatooine, they came under attack by two MagnaGuards in Rogue-class Porax-38 starfighters. Despite destroying the fighters, their ship was forced to crash-land in the Dune Sea. Tano, Skywalker, and R2 then took Rotta across the Dune Sea to reach his father's palace. However, she and Skywalker sensed Dooku's presence.\n\nWhile Skywalker distracted Dooku, Tano and R2 took Rotta to Jabba's palace. However, they came under attack by several MagnaGuards. Tano fought the MagnaGuards, destroying them all and meeting up with her master at Jabba's palace. However, Jabba ordered their execution until he was contacted by his uncle, Ziro. Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala then revealed to Jabba that his uncle was working with Dooku and was the one who arranged Rotta's kidnapping. Jabba then spared their lives, and Tano and her master were picked up by Master Kenobi and Yoda.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The Malevolence\n\nAt some point, Kenobi told Tano about how his own master, Qui-Gon Jinn, found Skywalker because of his quick reflexes. During the hunt for the Confederacy's new warship, the Malevolence, which was a Subjugator-class heavy cruiser armed with two mega-ion cannons powerful enough to disable the power systems of an entire fleet of warships, Tano, along with her master, were sent to protect the staging area in the Bith system. She and Skywalker were contacted by Master Plo Koon, who had tracked the Confederacy's secret weapon to the Abregado system. When Koon's transmission was lost, Tano urged her master to send support to Koon, but he required the Chancellor's and Jedi Council's permission. During the meeting, Skywalker and the Council believed that there were no survivors and Skywalker was ordered to protect the Republic's convoys. Tano then spoke up and urged them to search for survivors, but she was rebuffed by the Council and the Supreme Chancellor for her outburst. Skywalker had Admiral Yularen deploy their fleet while Skywalker and Tano took the Twilight to \"scout ahead.\"\n\nDespite Tano's outburst, her master agreed with her that they must search for survivors. At first, they were unsuccessful and were ordered by both Kenobi and Palpatine to give up their search. However, as Skywalker piloted the Twilight away, Tano sensed Koon and took the controls, piloting the Twilight to his escape pod's location. Tano and Skywalker found Koon with the clones Commander Wolffe, Sergeant Sinker, and trooper Boost. They learned from Koon that the Malevolence's weapon was an ion cannon mounted on an enormous ship that could disable ships. Tano then detected the Malevolence approaching them and hurried to disable power so they could blend into the debris field. At first, the ship passed, but it then detected the Twilight's medical droid TB-2, who was caring for the injured Wolffe, and fired the mega-ion cannon. Skywalker was able to outmaneuver debris and jump to hyperspace before the blast wave reached them.\n\nFollowing their return to the Republic fleet and the Resolute, Skywalker and Tano were given command of Shadow Squadron and dispatched on their next mission: to destroy both General Grievous and the Malevolence. Tano and Koon were both skeptical of the plan, knowing that Grievous would be well protected by his ship's defenses. Tano and Skywalker were then informed Grievous had attacked a medical convoy in the Ryndellia system. Skywalker deduced that Grievous's next target was the Republic's secret Outer Rim medical center near the Kaliida Nebula. Tano served as Skywalker's gunner aboard his BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber as Shadow Squadron flew to intercept Grievous.\n\nTano, along with her master, Koon, and Shadow Squadron, took a shortcut through the nebula. During the journey, Tano detected several Neebray mantas. Despite damage to one of the bombers and an astromech, Tano, Skywalker, Koon, and Shadow Squadron reached the medical station. The Malevolence then arrived, and Tano shot down several of the vulture droids despite her master's fancy flying. When Shadow Squadron started to lose more ships, Tano convinced her master to target the ion cannon instead of the bridge. This strategy succeeded in disabling both the Malevolence's ion cannons and its hyperdrive.\n\nTano, Skywalker, and Koon then rejoined Kenobi aboard the Resolute as he continued attacking the Malevolence. However, Tano detected a Naboo ship approaching the battlefield. Tano then picked up a comm signal from the ship's pilot, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. When Amidala was captured by a tractor beam, Skywalker decided to rescue the senator. Tano remained on the bridge of the Resolute with Koon and Admiral Yularen and guided both her master and Kenobi through the ship to find Amidala and her protocol droid, C-3PO, until Grievous jammed their transmissions. Tano watched as Skywalker, Kenobi, and Amidala made their escape, and the the Malevolence crashed into the Dead Moon of Antar.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Journey to Mortis\n\nTano, along with Skywalker and Kenobi, was then sent to rendezvous with Captain Rex to investigate a 2,000-year-old distress signal in the Chrelythiumn system. There, they were brought through a vergence within an ancient monolith to the planet Mortis, an ethereal realm within the Force. Inside, Skywalker quickly became separated from Kenobi and Tano, and the latter two found shelter as night fell. There, Tano was visited by a vision of her older self, warning against her attachment to Skywalker, saying she may never see her future if she remained his student. Her older self also said that Skywalker's attachment to the Dark Side would corrupt her if she did not remove herself from his teachings. Tano retorted that although her master was unconventional, she trusted him with her life and he trusted her. Soon after, Tano and Kenobi were both kidnapped by the Son and the Daughter. The Father, the master of the realm of Mortis, faced Skywalker with a choice to choose either Tano or Kenobi to save and the other to sacrifice. Skywalker opted to draw power from Mortis to save both his master and apprentice.\n\nLater, the three Jedi returned to their ship to try to leave but discovered they needed to make repairs. As they attempted to do so, Tano was kidnapped by the Son and imprisoned in a tower. Now chained, Tano boldly tried to free herself until she heard a voice and found herself in the company of a repulsive creature which addressed the young Padawan's innermost doubts and fears, specifically regarding her master. Tano was defiant in her belief in Skywalker, but realized that she still had doubts. The creature then freed Tano from her chains and tried to convince the Padawan to forget her master. When Tano refused, the creature bit her on the arm. As Tano collapsed in pain, the creature revealed itself to be the Son. Tano had been infected with the dark side of the Force.\n\nWhen Skywalker arrived to rescue Tano, the Son told him that if he did not join him, he would kill Ahsoka. Anakin refused, and the Son sent a corrupted Tano to attack her master in response. When Kenobi arrived with the Dagger of Mortis, Tano became enraged, knowing that it could free her from the Son's presence. Tano held her own against Kenobi and Skywalker as the Son and the Daughter fought. Eventually, Tano stole the Dagger from Kenobi and, smirking, gave it to the Son. The Son, claiming Tano was no longer of use, drained her life Force and instantly killed her.\n\nAs Tano lay dead, the Son turned to kill the Father. Instead, the Daughter lunged and took the blow, and the horrified Son dropped the weapon as he saw that the Daughter was mortally wounded. The Daughter told Skywalker that she could save Tano if she used him as a conduit to channel her life force into her. They completed the procedure as the Daughter died, bringing Ahsoka back to life and purging her of the darkness.\n\nAhsoka was then able to repair the ship as Skywalker faced the Son, and as the Father took his own life, Skywalker killed the Son. The three left the realm of Mortis as the Father died and found themselves back with the Republic fleet. Upon communicating with Rex, they learned that they had only gone for a moment into Mortis and that almost no time had passed at all.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Rejected\n\nA year and nine months into the war, Jedi Master Even Piell was captured by Separatist forces during his return from the Outer Rim. Piell carried vital information alongside Captain Wilhuff Tarkin involving the secret hyperspace lanes called the Nexus Route, which the Separatists sought to obtain. Upon his capture, he was taken to an ancient prison known as the Citadel, which had been designed to detain Jedi if any had strayed from their path. In order to rescue Master Piell, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Koon devised a plan to rescue him, and, as they exited the briefing room, Tano ran up beside them, apologizing for being late, citing that she had just heard about the briefing and asked for clarification on their rescue of Piell. As Skywalker stopped, Koon commented that Tano and Skywalker had much to discuss as Kenobi and Koon left to leave the two alone.\n\nWith this, Skywalker informed Tano that she would not be allowed to come along on this assignment and, after she objected, he informed her that the Citadel had been created to detain Jedi in case they had lost their way and that it wasn't a place for Padawans. However, Tano argued that this wasn't fair and that Skywalker was merely being protective, asking how she was going to learn if Skywalker was not willing for her to risk herself. However, Skywalker continued on by saying that this wasn't a mission to be teaching lessons to a Padawan and that it was meant as a do or die type of mission, not willing to share this risk with his Padawan. As he walked away, Tano grew increasingly frustrated.\n\nShortly afterwards, Tano consulted Master Koon for guidance on Skywalker's decision. In response to her inquiry, Koon simply informed her that it was Skywalker's decision to decide whether or not she should be allowed to go. However, Tano once again cited her belief that Skywalker was being overprotective, saying that he had been choosing which assignments she could partake in. Koon then responded by once again saying that he was her master to which Tano said that it should be her choice when she wanted to risk her life. With that, Koon began to ponder her argument.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Rescuing Even Piell\n\nAs they stealthily made their way through the hallways of the facility, Tano served as a lookout as they traversed through said hallways. As they neared Piell's cell, Skywalker ordered ARC trooper CT-5555 \"Fives\" to take out their surveillance leading several automated laser traps to attack the group, although they were easily taken out by their combined efforts. However, an electrified wall soon activated, forcing the group to run to cover, and killing \"Longshot,\" not managing to take cover in time. Even so, Kenobi ordered for the group to keep moving. As Master Piell was being tortured, the group arrived just in time to save him before an EV-series medical droid would've removed his one remaining eye. As the group arrived, Skywalker freed Master Piell from his containment field while Kenobi cradled him back to the ground. As he stood back up, he confirmed he had not revealed the coordinates of the Nexus Route as Kenobi handed him his lightsaber back. However, Master Piell also confirmed that he only had half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route and that his captain had the other half, forcing the group to free them as well. With this, Skywalker was forced to come up with a new plan for escaping the facility and, with that, the group made their way to the second cell.\n\nAs they made their way there, Sobeck's special units\u2013six commando droids, specially designed with the logo of the Citadel on their armor plating\u2013arrived, surrounding the group and beginning their attack. During the battle, one of the commando droids tackled Tano and wrestled her to the ground before she managed to cut off its head, disabling it. Shortly afterward, Sobeck employed the use of ringing noise, distracting the group, and activating a magnetic field, allowing him to take their weapons and attracting Skywalker's cybernetic hand as Sobeck began to electrocute him, leading Tano to call out towards him. Soon after, more of Sobeck's special units arrived as Sobeck announced that they were going to be his \"guests\" for a very long time as they appeared to have been captured.\n\nHowever, Piell, Kenobi, and Tano used the Force to attempt to knock the droids over, but instead discovered that the droids were magnetized to the floor. Even so, the group continued this tactic, causing the droids' shots to miss their targets as the clones attempted to destroy them using their bare hands; however, the droids instead knocked them to the ground. As they did this, Skywalker managed to grab his lightsaber as Sobeck continued to electrify him and deactivate the magnetic field, returning each weapon to its respective group member and leading Skywalker to fall back towards the floor. With that, the group easily managed to destroy the commando droids as they continued their way towards the officers' cell. Before Rex left, he shot the camera Sobeck had been using to watch them, causing him to lose track of where they were.\n\nFinally arriving at their intended destination, the group opened the door as Tano swooped in from behind Skywalker, kicking one of the commando droids to the ground and eliminating it through the use of one of her lightsabers. As the rest of the group arrived in the cell, Tarkin, Piell's captain, noted their presence and asked how they were going to get out of the facility. With that, Kenobi offered a solution where he and Skywalker split up, assigning Piell and Tarkin to separate groups in case either was captured. Although briefly rejecting the idea, Tarkin eventually gave in after an inquiry from Piell and was assigned to Skywalker's group alongside Tano as Piell went with Kenobi's group. Kenobi's group intended to cause a distraction on their way to the landing pad to meet with their shuttle while Skywalker's group used the old fortress tunnels in order to maneuver around the facility and make it towards the pipeline where they too would be rescued by the shuttle.",

Several Senate Commandos under Captain Faro Argyus were also dispatched as extra security to accompany the Jedi. Though Tano was initially skeptical of the need for so much security for just one Neimoidian, Unduli assured the Padawan that his allies could easily be conspiring against them and devising a rescue plan. The Mirialan Jedi Master was indeed correct, as Count Dooku had already sent his most trusted assassin, Asajj Ventress, to extract the Viceroy and return him to the Separatists. As Tano and Unduli attempted to interrogate Gunray, with the Jedi Master chastising Tano for threatening him out of impatience, Ventress and her small contingent of Super Battle Droids breached the hull of the ship.\n\nTano was left to guard Gunray as Unduli and Commander Gree went to deal with the droids, where she was confronted by Ventress, who had slipped inside the ship undetected. Tano was once again confident enough to taunt Ventress as they dueled. The two dueled for a short time before Ventress managed to free Gunray and tricked Tano, trapping the Padawan behind an energy shield in his holding cell. Unduli arrived shortly after, freeing Tano so the two of them could duel Ventress together. However, instead of surrendering, Ventress set off several explosives which she had planted in the engine room, knocking both Jedi to the deck, and escaped down the elevator shaft. Though Tano wanted to follow and confront the assassin once again, Unduli beckoned her to stay put despite her protests. Ultimately deciding to disobey Unduli's instructions, Tano arrived just in time to save the Jedi Master from certain death by Ventress' blade. United as a team, the two Jedi confronted Ventress for a second time, though she once again escaped, this time accompanied by Gunray and Republic defector Faro Argyus. Thus, Ventress successfully completed, her mission much to the dismay of Tano and Unduli.\n\n",

Tano and Amidala then returned to Coruscant, where they informed Chancellor Palpatine of their negotiations.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Return of Aurra Sing\n\nFollowing her mission to Mandalore, Tano was commended by the Jedi Council for her actions. However, the Council ordered her to remain at the Temple while her master commanded the 3rd Legion on Balith to assist with its civil war. Tano then had a disturbing dream about Aurra Sing, who she thought had perished on Florrum. The visions then showed that Sing was targeting Senator Amidala.\n\nTano then warned Amidala that she was being targeted by Sing. Despite her warning, Amidala then continued to prepare for her speech at Alderaan's Refugee Conference. However, Tano was allowed to accompany her to the conference as additional security. After their arrival, Tano saw the location of Sing's attack on Amidala, warning her and Captain Gregar Typho of this. When the conference started, Tano discovered Sing but could not prevent her from wounding Amidala on the shoulder. Tano pursued her, but Sing escaped.\n\nDespite Tano and Organa's pleas for Amidala to return to Coruscant, she chose to stay and resume her speech. However, Tano devised a plan to allow Amidala to deliver her speech but remain in safety. Amidala used a BD-3000 luxury droid dressed in her clothes to cast her speech while she stayed in her room. However, Tano sensed that Sing was not deceived and realized she had discovered Amidala in her room. Tano rushed in and deflected the blast when Sing fired on Amidala. She then pulled Sing down out of the vent. Tano fought her until Sing knocked her out. However, Amidala was able to stun Sing. Tano and Amidala returned to Coruscant, where Tano reported to Skywalker and Master Yoda. Tano and Amidala identify Sing's employer as Ziro the Hutt, who wanted her dead due to her interference with his plans earlier in the war.\n\n",

ARC troopers Fives and Echo were the only other people who knew the algorithm. However, during the Battle of Anaxes, the Separatist Droid Army was somehow pushing back the Republic forces on all fronts, and Rex theorized that the Separatists had somehow gained access to the algorithm, despite Echo and Fives both being presumed dead and that he was the only person who should have known of its existence. Infiltrating the Separatist Cyber Center on Anaxes, Rex and Clone Force 99 member Tech discovered that the algorithm was actually being broadcast live from Skako Minor by a still-alive Echo, who was in the custody of the Separatist-aligned Techno Union. Separatist Admiral Trench had been using the algorithm to gain an advantage over the Republic's forces during the battle.\n\n",

Upon arrival, Skywalker sent Tano with Gungan native Peppi Bow to investigate the swamps where Amidala and Binks were last seen. Inadvertently, they triggered a spy camera, which they managed to hide from, indicating the presence of an underground bunker beneath the swamp. Acting on the instructions of Kenobi and Skywalker, Tano infiltrated the facility by dropping a thermal detonator down one of the exit hatches, allowing for easier entrance. Tano and Rex discovered that Doctor Nuvo Vindi had a secret laboratory underneath the ground and that he was responsible for the creation of the virus that he called the Blue Shadow Virus. They then distracted Vindi's droids, allowing Kenobi and Skywalker to infiltrate the facility quietly. The Jedi captured Vindi before he could detonate the bombs inside the facility and thus release the Blue Shadow Virus into Naboo's atmosphere. However, unbeknownst to anyone, one of Vindi's servant droids had stolen one of the bombs before it could be deactivated by Kenobi and the clone bomb squad.\n\nBefore the facility could be properly evacuated, the servant droid activated its bomb shortly before destroying himself, releasing the virus. Amidala triggered the alarm in time, shutting down the facility and preventing the virus from escaping to the outside. Tano, trapped inside, made it into a safe room along with several other clones, but was unfortunately contaminated. While her masters attempted to find a cure on Iego, Tano and Amidala worked together to prevent any droids from escaping the facility and thereby releasing the virus into Naboo's air. Eventually, thanks to Jar Jar Binks's clumsiness, Amidala also became infected by the virus, and her and Tano's conditions worsened as time went on, and many clones died. At one point, Tano collapsed and fell unconscious from the effects of the virus. Luckily, Skywalker and Kenobi were able to obtain a cure, stop the virus, and rescue Rex, Amidala, Tano, and the surviving clones.\n\n",

As she approached the temple, she heard a large crowd screaming for help. Within an instant, the Togruta Jedi turned around and followed the sounds of their screams to help them. Upon turning the corner she witnessed a female Aleena and her child being attacked by a rogue droid. Immediately she noticed that some of its wiring was exposed. She at first utilized the Force to throw a crate towards it, to get its attention. As it approached her underneath residential water pipes, Tano ignited her dual lightsabers. She sprinted towards it, slicing one of its legs off, and proceeded to jump up and sever the water pipes. Water gushed down onto the droid, causing it to break down. The Padawan checked to see if the mother and child were okay before she suddenly remembered the ceremony that she was already late for. As she arrived at the Jedi Temple, she met Skywalker and Yoda by the Great Tree. As the ceremony began, Master Yoda stated that Tano was humble and brave, which he thought of as a sign of maturity. He went on to say that she was on the right path to becoming a Jedi Master, before awarding her with an add-on to her Padawan braid.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Stranded on Maridun\n\nAhsoka Tano and Anakin Skywalker, along with a fleet of Republic gunships, were later sent to evacuate Jedi Knight Aayla Secura from Separatist forces after her fleet had been defeated during the Battle of Quell. The two Jedi, Rex, and their clone battalion managed to board Secura's ship and rendezvous with the Twi'lek Jedi and her own battalion, narrowly escaping onto a docked cruiser with an injured Skywalker, who had been caught in an explosion from the Separatist attack. Tano and Skywalker led Secura and some survivors from her battalion, which were Clone Commander Bly, Lucky, Flash, and Cameron, to a cruiser. On their way, Skywalker was gravely injured saving the group from an explosion. They were forced to jump to hyperspace prematurely in order to escape the exploding Resolute in time, much to the alarm of Admiral Yularen. As a result, they were forced to crash-land on Maridun in order to avoid colliding with one of its nearby stars.\n\nStranded on the planet following the explosion of their cruiser, they set up a crude camp using some parts from the wrecked ship. Fearing for her wounded master, Tano volunteered to watch over him with Rex, but Secura insisted that they instead work together to find help from the local population. Tano reluctantly agreed and accompanied Secura and Commander Bly to scout for help while Rex remained with Skywalker. Along the way, the young Padawan confessed to Secura her feelings of confusion towards the Jedi Code over the rule of not forming attachments yet also showing compassion. In response, Secura shared similar feelings that she used to have regarding her own master, whom she eventually was able to let go. Not long after, they were ambushed by a pack of mastiff phalones which killed Flash, Lucky, and Cameron. After a long journey, they found the local Lurmen village, encountering the village elder Tee Watt Kaa and his son Wag Too. Initially, Watt Kaa refused to help the Jedi, not wanting to be involved in the war, but later agreed to send his son with Tano to retrieve Skywalker for healing on the condition that Secura remained with the village as insurance. Wag Too and Tano later returned with Skywalker and Too healed his wounds using native healing oils.\n\nWhen Separatist forces arrived under the command of Lok Durd in order to impose their \"protection\" of the Lurmen people, the Jedi were forced to leave the village to prevent the villagers from paying the price due to their presence. As the Jedi hid, they discovered a nearby heavily guarded Separatist base and Durd's superweapon: the Defoliator, which was capable of destroying all organic life. When they realized that Durd meant to test this weapon on the Lurmen village, the Jedi revealed themselves to protect the villagers. At first, Watt Kaa adamantly opposed getting involved in any way, not even defending his people, but changed his mind after the Jedi fended off Durd's forces and saved the village from annihilation, thanking them personally for their efforts.\n\n",

Then, Tano gave them access to the detention complex after she performed a mind trick and then destroyed a group of super battle droids.

Tracking the criminal to a run-down bar, her master instructed her to wait while he apprehended him. Due to Affa's sudden arrest, a large crowd of patrons swarmed from the bar, and in the commotion that followed, the small Patrolian pickpocket Bannamu managed to steal the Padawan's lightsaber from her hip. Ashamed, Tano could not bring herself to admit to Skywalker that she had lost her weapon and immediately headed to the archives in the hopes of tracking down her thief once they reached the temple. There, she met the elderly Jedi Master Tera Sinube, who agreed to help her locate her missing lightsaber. At first, Tano was frustrated with Sinube's preference of patience over speed, which was in great contrast to her own style, but grew to accept and respect the old Jedi Master's methods. Eventually, they found the lightsaber in the possession of underworld criminals Cassie Cryar and Ione Marcy. Tano engaged with Cryar in a wild foot chase throughout the city, though the Terrelian Jango Jumper was too quick for the young Padawan and managed to escape. Ultimately, Tano and Sinube managed to reclaim her lightsaber from Cryar. After the chase, the elder Jedi asked Tano to pass on what she had learned from him to some Jedi younglings.\n\n",

Part of a deployed 501st battalion, the platoon was part of the Grand Army of the Republic's offensive on the planet Umbara, and participated in the initial landing of the battle.\n\nAs the battle progressed further towards the planet's capital, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, the 501st's revered leader, was relieved by Jedi General Pong Krell after he was called back to Coruscant. Krell wasted no time in deploying the platoon on a march down the main road to the capital city, a move protested by Clone Captain Rex, who also led the unit. Nonetheless, they followed orders, which led to a deadly ambush from Umbaran Militia, causing numerous casualties and the forced retreat of the platoon.\n\nAs the 501st progressed further into Umbaran territory, Krell ordered the platoon, along with the rest of the 501st, to advance through a narrow gorge towards an airbase, a vital target for the Republic due to its capability to supply starfighters to the joint Confederacy and Umbaran defensive efforts. The decision was met with some resistance, as members of the platoon voiced their concern about Krell's full-frontal attack method, which barely constituted as a tactic at all.\n\nConcerns aside, the platoon, backed by the rest of the legion, advanced into Umbaran territory. They were met with heavy resistance by Impeding Assault Tanks and mobile heavy cannons, but due to the rebellious actions of platoon members Hardcase and Fives, the clone forces were able to repel the attacks using the Umbaran's own technology against them, as the two troopers managed to commandeer and haphazardly perform deadly strafing runs on the Umbaran tanks.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Working with Senator Amidala\n\nSkywalker arranged an an engagement to escort Senator Amidala on a mission to the planet Alderaan. Unbeknownst to Tano and the Jedi Council, Skywalker and Amidala had secretly married shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis and planned to use this mission to spend time alone together. To her master's disgruntlement, however, Tano was also assigned to the mission at the suggestion of Kenobi, who had some understanding of the couple's close relationship.\n\nBoarding a T-6 shuttle, the trio departed from Coruscant and made the jump to hyperspace. Now wanting the mission to end as soon as possible, Skywalker changed the ship's flight trajectory to travel along a different route. Tano warned her master that they would pass through a sector of suspected Separatist activity, and when the ship pulled out of hyperspace, true to the Padawan's word, they were met with five Munificent-class star frigates. At the senator's command, Amidala and Tano manned the guns as Skywalker flew through the Confederate fleet.\n\nAlthough the Jedi Knight's flying skills managed to get the ship through most of the fleet, one of the frigates was able to land a blow on the Republic shuttle, knocking the senator to the floor. As the smoke in the shuttle cleared, Tano saw that Skywalker had caught Amidala, who held her husband tightly in her arms. Seeing that the two were preoccupied, Tano took to the pilot's seat and managed to safely bring the ship to Alderaan. After landing, Skywalker thanked his Padawan for her help before leaving her and the senator alone. The two women shared a moment together, acknowledging the other's relationship with Skywalker.\n\nIn the Jedi Temple dojo, Tano and Padawan Barriss Offee had a training session and practiced lightsaber combat. As they spared, Offee used the Force to push Tano to the floor. Seeing an opportunity, Tano threw one of her lightsabers at Offee, catching the Mirialan off guard. Jumping up and igniting her remaining lightsaber, Tano brought Offee to yield, ending the match. Offee said that it was not a good match, stating that Tano would not have thrown her weapon in a real battle and that she had learned nothing from the session.\n\nThe two walked from the dojo and spoke about the differences between their masters' teachings. When Offee accused Tano of losing patience and forgetting the lightsaber forms, Tano replied by saying that the forms did not help her in real battles. Tano handed her lightsabers to Offee, who then demonstrated how using Form VI would have helped her. When they arrived at Tano's quarters, she thanked Offee for the match, and they parted ways.\n\nIn her quarters, Tano tried the lightsaber forms but was unsuccessful. To clear her mind, she sat down and began to meditate. As she meditated, she thought about how Offee had been right, and she determined that she needed to think like a Jedi and that she still was not good enough. Tano's meditation was interrupted when Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala knocked on the door, and Tano invited her inside.\n\nTano was surprised to see Amidala at the Temple and asked if everything was alright. Amidala explained that she was going to host an important meeting with the Arthurian delegates the next day, and the senator asked Tano if she would perform a security check. Tano doubted that Amidala needed her, saying that Captain Typho and the handmaidens would be enough. But thinking back to her training session with Offee, Tano ultimately agreed to the job.\n\nThe following evening, Tano established a perimeter around Amidala's apartment and assured the senator that the outside of the building was clear. Amidala thanked the Padawan and requested that she stay for the meeting, well aware that her negotiations with the delegates from Arthuria were opposed by many. Tano politely declined, however, not wanting to interfere in the dealings of politicians.\n\nBefore she could leave, Tano noticed that the banquet table that one of the Senator's handmaidens had prepared was set with utensils, which were customarily never used by Arthurians. When Amidala questioned the handmaiden for the potentially offensive act, the servant pulled out a blaster and fired upon the duo. As Tano confronted the handmaiden, she revealed herself to be Cato Parasitti, the same shape-shifting assassin whom Tano had encountered during Cad Bane's heist at the Jedi Temple. After a small fire fight, Tano was able to subdue Parasitti and dispose of a bomb the changeling had planted in the apartment.\n\nTano went on to train Senator Amidala in starfighter combat, taking the Naboolian to a remote asteroid field to undergo flight exercises. Although Tano believed the field to be devoid of enemy forces, the duo were soon ambushed by a modified vulture droid that was stationed on one of the asteroids. The droid pursued them through the field and immobilized Tano's N-1 starfighter with an ion torpedo, knocking her unconscious. Using the Padawan's teachings, Amidala was able to defend her friend and destroy the droid. Tano came to and praised the senator for her instincts before the two journeyed back home.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Rescuing Even Piell\n\nEventually, Koon agreed with Tano's sentiment and, in a way, assigned her to the mission. After being \"assigned,\" Tano was frozen in carbonite and placed aboard their stolen Sheathipede-class transport shuttle alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and the clones. As they approached Lola Sayu, the planet the Citadel was housed upon, Commandant Osi Sobeck, the warden of the prison, grew increasingly suspicious of their true cargo and ordered for his droids to scan for lifeforms. However, after doing a full scan of the ship, the scanners came up empty, showing that the Republic's ruse had worked. As they arrived on the planet, the shuttle deviated from where it was assigned to land, choosing instead to hide within the volcanic canyons of the planet and unload their \"cargo.\"\n\nAs Tano was unfrozen, Skywalker passingly acknowledged her presence before realizing that Tano wasn't supposed to be on the assignment. As Kenobi woke up alongside him, he noted that he believed he must have been given carbon sickness as he was seeing Tano was with them. In response, Skywalker confirmed to him that his sight was fine and that Tano's hearing was the thing that needed assistance instead. In defense, Tano explained that she had received orders from Koon and that she thought he had known about it. Skywalker grew more disgruntled with her as he told her that Koon had not told him about her joining the mission, which Tano followed up by saying that he had already been in carbonite when the decision had been made. Pointing at Tano, he once again informed her that he had specifically told her not to come, but Tano defended herself by saying that Skywalker had taught her that following direct orders wasn't always the right decision. With that, Kenobi walked over and commented on Skywalker's teaching style before welcoming Tano to the mission, leading Tano to smile. After Kenobi's inquiry, the discussion ended.\n\nBefore departing for the facility, Tano had a discussion with one of the 212th troopers accompanying them as CC-2224 \"Cody\" was preparing his backpack. Once Cody finished preparing his pack, the two made their way to the cliff surrounding the Citadel. Arriving at a safe distance to avoid detection, Kenobi and Skywalker stopped to survey the cliff they were intending to climb in order to make their way to an entry point into the Citadel. Kenobi suggested that they use ascension cables, but was met with disapproval from Skywalker as he noted the electromines dotting the cliff face and that the ascension cables would have nothing to grab onto without hitting the electromines, which would notify the entire prison of their presence. With this, Rex suggested that they freeclimb it which was met with approval from both Kenobi and Skywalker as the group continued their journey to the Citadel.\n\nThe group soon began to climb the cliff face during which Skywalker asked how Tano was doing during her climb to which Tano simply said that she couldn't be better, but noted that the strong winds were providing a challenge. As they continued their climb, Kenobi traveled up to the platform where the entry point the group wished to enter through was located, but was stopped when several droids appeared through the entry point, forcing him to tell the rest of the group to remain silent, causing them to briefly pause their climb. As the droids returned inside, they activated a ray shield, which Kenobi noted to the rest of the group, leading Skywalker to become distressed as the ray shield wasn't originally in the plan. Continuing her climb, Tano noted that an opening was near the door and that she might be able to squeeze through the ventilation ducts and disable to ray shield. Skywalker then met her proposal with approval after an inquiry from Kenobi and she made her way to the shaft and entered, arriving just outside the ray shielded door. As she exited, she checked for any droid patrols, noticing none and made her way to the door controls, simply pressing a single button and deactivating the ray shield. As Skywalker, entered she tried to show off to him, noting that she could handle herself. However, as the rest of the group finished making their way up to the platform, a clone named \"Charger\" lost his grip on the cliff and began tumbling down towards the lava below, hitting an electromine on his way down and alerting the entire facility to the group's presence. With that, all security protocols were activated, the entire facility was placed on lockdown, and Sobeck's special units were assigned to hunt the group down.",

The Jedi, hoping to recapture Geonosian and Separatist leader Poggle the Lesser and destroy the Geonosis primary droid foundry, planned a three-pronged attack against Poggle's Geonosian droid foundries. Early on in the mission, Skywalker and Tano's gunship was shot down, but the duo survived and continued their attack, battling the Geonosian defense line.\n\nWith Rex and a force of surviving clones, they attacked a Geonosian fortress that stood in their way. Skywalker and Tano scaled the wall and destroyed the droids before blowing the wall so they could continue to the rendezvous point. After reuniting with Mundi and his troops, who had been separated from the main force, Tano and Skywalker began to throw electromagnetic pulse grenades to disable the enemy cannons, enabling the AT-TEs to destroy the shield generator, which forced the remaining Geonosians to surrender. Tano and Skywalker then playfully exchanged their kill counts, though Mundi's far rivaled both of their own.\n\nTano began to grow frustrated with Skywalker after he continually cut her off during the briefing for the next stage of the mission, believing that she had not earned her master's complete trust. After Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and her Padawan Barriss Offee arrived to help plan the attack on the droid foundry, Tano and Offee were sent to infiltrate and destroy the foundry from the inside. The plan was to go through the underground Geonosian catacombs underneath the facility while Unduli and Skywalker led the 501st and the 41st Elite Corps to engage in a frontal assault as a distraction. Though Tano was initially annoyed by Offee's \"dependable\" nature and Unduli's trust in her due to her own feelings of inadequacy, the two Padawans quickly bonded and were able to work well as a team.\n\nThough the two Padawans made it into the reactor room, they were ambushed by one of Poggle's super tanks, which promptly fired upon them. After Offee destroyed the two droid drivers, she and Tano took control of the tank, deciding to use it on the reactor, fully aware that they would likely perish as a result of the explosion. They successfully destroyed the foundry but were buried under the rubble, surviving the explosion. Tano saved both of their lives by hot-wiring her comlink in order to alert Unduli and Skywalker of their location. Upon being rescued, both masters were happy to see that their Padawans had survived. Unduli informed Tano that her master never gave up on her, which reassured Tano that Skywalker trusted her and knew she was capable of handling herself.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Confronting Cad Bane\n\nArriving in the Devaron system, Tano and Skywalker's cruiser was forced to engage Bane's Separatist fleet, as the Duros bounty hunter had already captured Ropal. Infiltrating Bane's frigate, the two Jedi stormed the bridge, using R2-D2 to access the ship's computer to locate Ropal. However, they arrived too late, with Tano finding only his corpse inside the detention block. The Jedi then pursued Bane into the ship's gunnery room, with Bane switching off the artificial gravity as he and his battle droids attacked. After R2 reactivated the gravity, Bane attempted to flee. Tano, not willing to let him escape, pursued him despite her master's warnings. Confronting him in a dead-end corridor, Tano bested Bane in hand-to-hand combat after he disarmed her. However, as she attempted to retrieve her lightsaber with the Force, Bane suddenly grabbed her ankle and sent a paralyzing electric shock through her body, rendering her unconscious. Bane then bound her wrists with stuncuffs and stole her silka bead Padawan braid, holding her hostage, hoping that her master would try to rescue her.\n\nOnce Skywalker did indeed arrive, Bane blackmailed him into unlocking his stolen holocron, threatening to launch Tano into space by opening an airlock behind her. Bane opened the airlock anyway, forcing Skywalker to save his Padawan as Bane once again escaped. The Jedi escaped the exploding ship along with Rex, Denal, and several other clone troopers, unaware that Bane had actually killed Denal and redressed himself in the clone's armor. Tano later apologized to Skywalker for once again disobeying her master's orders, but he replied that the mission's failure was his fault and not hers.\n\nAfter returning from their failed mission, Tano and Skywalker were instructed by the Council to track down and intercept Bane on Naboo in order to prevent him from abducting one of the local Gungans, a Force-sensitive infant named Roo-Roo Page. Tano and Skywalker ambushed Bane in the infant's bedroom, with Tano confronting him with her lightsaber. After a failed escape attempt, Bane was finally brought into custody, and Page was returned to his mother. Before he was taken away, Tano reclaimed her stolen Padawan braid. Though they prevented the kidnapping, there still remained several other Force-sensitive children that Bane had succeeded in stealing away, so the two Jedi investigated Bane's starfighter for any clues as to where he might have hidden the children. Determining that they were most likely on Mustafar, Tano and Skywalker set out immediately to the volcanic planet. There, they found the children in one of Darth Sidious' secret facilities and battled several surgery droids in order to recover the children, who were eventually returned safely to their respective families. After the mission, they returned to the Temple, where Tano was disappointed to learn from the Council that Bane had escaped once again.\n\n",

In the Jedi Temple dojo, Skywalker and Tano were sparring, with the former teaching Tano to use her new lightsaber. However, being new to using two lightsabers at once, Tano forgot about her second blade was easily disarmed by Skywalker. Tano apologized to Skywalker for forgetting to use her second blade, but he waved it off, claiming that it took time to learn a new technique.\n\nAs Tano retrieved her blade, Yoda entered the dojo, wanting to see Tano's progress in using her second lightsaber. Tano agreed to this after gaining Skywalker's approval and she walked out, igniting her first blade immediately. Skywalker cringed as Yoda looked at her in disappointment, telling her that she needed to bow before a duel in the dojo. Embarrassed that she had forgotten, she put her blade away and followed the Grand Master's command. She then reignited her blade, forgetting about her second one. With this, Yoda commanded her to use her second blade. Tano then ignited her second blade as Yoda ignited his.\n\nWith one swing of his blade, Yoda managed to knock Tano back as she attempted to block with both blades. Yoda then attempted to teach Tano about how the two blades were like master and apprentice. With this, Tano stood up and attempted a stabbing motion on Yoda, but he simply ducked out of the way and tripped her. As Tano stood back up, Yoda taught her that she must always be herself, and Tano realized that she needed to fight like herself. She reignited her blades, and Yoda attacked once more, but she was able to block this time. Yoda told Tano that she had learned well.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Incident aboard TB-73\n\nAfter the rescue of Master Luminara Unduli from the Geonosians and the subsequent death of Queen Karina the Great, Tano and Offee were sent to transport medical supplies. The plan was to bring the supplies from Geonosis to Mace Windu on Dantooine from a station near Ord Cestus on board the medical frigate TB-73. They were, however, unaware that several Geonosian brain worms had been smuggled inside the ship by Scythe, a worm-infected clone trooper. As the worms began to infect the rest of the ship's crew, the worm-controlled clone troopers turned on the two Padawans, who were forced to defend themselves, first in the mess hall against Ox and Edge and later against Trap, whom Offee was forced to kill out of self-defense. Tano, using her lightsaber, then killed Trap's worm, which had emerged from his mouth. In the cargo hold, Tano and Offee fled into the ventilation system after the infected clones outnumbered them. Splitting up, Tano headed towards the communication room to warn Jedi Master Kit Fisto of the situation while Offee went to disable the thrusters.\n\nUpon making contact with Fisto, the Nautolan Jedi Master instructed her to dock at the medical base despite her concerns over the brain worms spreading. She also updated her master on the situation before ending the transmission. Immediately following her message, she was suddenly ambushed by Barriss Offee, who had been infected by one of the worms on her way to the reactor room. The two fought each other as Tano tried in vain to break the creature's influence over her friend's mind. After a short confrontation, Tano once again escaped into the ventilation system, now the only individual on the ship not under the control of the worms. After learning that the worms were in fact affected by cold temperatures from Skywalker over her comlink, Tano ruptured the coolant system to decrease the temperature inside the ship, which would inhibit the brain worms.\n\nOffee once again confronted Tano on the bridge, though Tano managed to fight her off, temporarily releasing Offee from the brain worm's influence with a blast from a ruptured coolant pipe. Though Offee begged Tano to kill her, the Padawan instead killed her brain worm as it emerged from Offee's mouth. As the ship docked in the medical base, Fisto entered the freezing ship to find a barely conscious Tano cradling her unconscious friend. The two Padawans were then taken to the medical bay to recover from their ordeal. As Tano pondered what might have happened if she had killed Offee, Skywalker attempted to console her, believing that she did the right thing to save her friend.\n\nAt the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Tano, along with Offee, watched a transmission of General Grievous and his MagnaGuards torturing Master Eeth Koth. Tano and Offee comforted several of the younglings when they witnessed Koth screaming in pain. She and Offee then took the younglings away at Master Yoda's request while the others planned a rescue.\n\n",

Although Rex suggested that the legion should send recon units out to provide intelligence regarding terrain and the enemy defenses, Krell ordered that the entire legion into a frontal attack. This command was met with some resistance from the already beleaguered clone troopers, especially from Advanced Recon Commando trooper Fives. His dissent was backed by other members of the 501st, but Captain Rex curtly told his friend and comrade that, as soldiers, expected to follow orders\u2014even when they were bordering on suicide.\n\nThe 501st, led by members of the platoon, marched into tentatively into the Confederacy-occupied territory. As expected, the 501st\u2014including Rex's platoon\u2014was attacked by Umbaran Impeding Assault Tanks, which emerged from underground ambush locations to attack the troopers. Significant casualties were sustained by the legion before troopers eventually lured the tanks into a narrow kill zone, enabling troopers armed with RPS-6 rocket launchers and thermal detonators. The clones continued moving forward, executing Umbaran survivors as they moved. However, their victory was short-lived, as Umbaran reinforcements arrived, this time equipped with spider cannons, which were impervious to blaster or rocket fire. The 501st was pushed back once again and was forced to leave behind dead and injured troopers, much to the chagrin of the platoon medic, Kix.\n\nAlthough the 501st was in no position to repel the Umbaran attack, Krell ordered the clones to continue the assault, disregarding the horrendous losses being sustained. In a desperate attempt to destroy the tanks, Rex authorized troopers Hardcase and Fives, both members under his platoon under his direct command, to infiltrate the airbase\u2014a mission that they had been specifically ordered not to attempt. Their mission was successful, and they were able to commandeer two Umbaran starfighters, which they subsequently utilized to strafe the Umbaran tanks, destroying them and enabling the main 501st force to finally capture the base.\n\n",

Tano led the clone pilots of Blue Squadron, Axe, Slammer, Kickback, Tucker, and Swoop, into battle against the Separatist blockade that was helmed by Captain Mar Tuuk. However, Tano's squadron had fallen right into a trap, and they were ambushed by four Munificent-class star frigates. Tano stubbornly insisted that they continue their attack rather than retreating as instructed to her by Skywalker and Admiral Yularen. After the majority of the clones' starfighters were destroyed as a result, Tano returned to the Resolute, devastated by the loss of her squad. Her master then reprimanded her for disobeying direct orders, and though she claimed that she was only acting on his teachings, she accepted full responsibility for her actions. Though Skywalker attempted to console her, the loss of her pilots left Tano scarred and feeling incredibly guilty.\n\nLater, Skywalker devised a plan to ram the Defender directly into the blockade, thus taking out Tuuk in the process, and allowing the full bulk of their forces, under the command of Tano, to finish the job by taking out the rest of the blockade while Skywalker jettisoned himself in an escape pod. Tano, still affected by her losses, reluctantly accepted leadership once again, this time successfully destroying the blockade with her Y-wing squadron while simultaneously protecting the Resolute by ordering Rex and Yularen into a unorthodox tilt maneuver, turning the cruiser's bridge away from the enemy fire so that only the belly of the ship was exposed. With the blockade destroyed, the Republic could begin its liberation of the Twi'lek people. Later, Tano and Skywalker assisted Mace Windu by providing air support, fighting off Separatist bombers that were tasked with destroying the city of Lessu. By driving out and defeating the Separatists and Wat Tambor, the Republic liberated the planet from Dooku's control.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - An unlikely alliance\n\nDuring the investigation of a missing medical station over Felucia, Tano, Skywalker, and Kenobi instead found a Separatist vulture droid base. After being attacked by a swarm of vulture droids, the three Jedi crash-landed onto the planet's surface, where they discovered a small Felucian village. Though it initially appeared deserted, they soon discovered a group of farmers in hiding, under the protection of the group of bounty hunters Sugi, Embo, Rumi Paramita, and Seripas. They realized that the bounty hunters were defending the village from a pirate gang led by Hondo Ohnaka. Together, the Jedi found a long term solution and trained the villagers to be able to look after themselves.\n\nAlthough she found that the farmers learned quickly, Tano also realized she needed to remind herself that they lacked the patience and adaptably possessed by clone troopers, as the Felucians simply were not soldiers, so she needed to treat them differently from the clones. When Ohnaka led his men to attack the village, the villagers had their training put to the test. When Seripas was almost crushed to death, Tano saved him and realized that Seripas was actually a small Ssori in an imposing suit of armor. Tano reassured Seripas that he did not need the armor to be strong and helped the villagers fight off Ohnaka's pirates, who left when Ohnaka declared the venture no longer profitable. In return for their help, Sugi gave the three Jedi a ride back to Republic lines in her ship.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Rescuing Even Piell\n\nEventually, Koon agreed with Tano's sentiment and, in a way, assigned her to the mission. After being \"assigned,\" Tano was frozen in carbonite and placed aboard their stolen Sheathipede-class transport shuttle alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and the clones. As they approached Lola Sayu, the planet the Citadel was housed upon, Commandant Osi Sobeck, the warden of the prison, grew increasingly suspicious of their true cargo and ordered for his droids to scan for lifeforms. However, after doing a full scan of the ship, the scanners came up empty, showing that the Republic's ruse had worked. As they arrived on the planet, the shuttle deviated from where it was assigned to land, choosing instead to hide within the volcanic canyons of the planet and unload their \"cargo.\"\n\nAs Tano was unfrozen, Skywalker passingly acknowledged her presence before realizing that Tano wasn't supposed to be on the assignment. As Kenobi woke up alongside him, he noted that he believed he must have been given carbon sickness as he was seeing Tano was with them. In response, Skywalker confirmed to him that his sight was fine and that Tano's hearing was the thing that needed assistance instead. In defense, Tano explained that she had received orders from Koon and that she thought he had known about it. Skywalker grew more disgruntled with her as he told her that Koon had not told him about her joining the mission, which Tano followed up by saying that he had already been in carbonite when the decision had been made. Pointing at Tano, he once again informed her that he had specifically told her not to come, but Tano defended herself by saying that Skywalker had taught her that following direct orders wasn't always the right decision. With that, Kenobi walked over and commented on Skywalker's teaching style before welcoming Tano to the mission, leading Tano to smile. After Kenobi's inquiry, the discussion ended.\n\nBefore departing for the facility, Tano had a discussion with one of the 212th troopers accompanying them as CC-2224 \"Cody\" was preparing his backpack. Once Cody finished preparing his pack, the two made their way to the cliff surrounding the Citadel. Arriving at a safe distance to avoid detection, Kenobi and Skywalker stopped to survey the cliff they were intending to climb in order to make their way to an entry point into the Citadel. Kenobi suggested that they use ascension cables, but was met with disapproval from Skywalker as he noted the electromines dotting the cliff face and that the ascension cables would have nothing to grab onto without hitting the electromines, which would notify the entire prison of their presence. With this, Rex suggested that they freeclimb it which was met with approval from both Kenobi and Skywalker as the group continued their journey to the Citadel.\n\nThe group soon began to climb the cliff face during which Skywalker asked how Tano was doing during her climb to which Tano simply said that she couldn't be better, but noted that the strong winds were providing a challenge. As they continued their climb, Kenobi traveled up to the platform where the entry point the group wished to enter through was located, but was stopped when several droids appeared through the entry point, forcing him to tell the rest of the group to remain silent, causing them to briefly pause their climb. As the droids returned inside, they activated a ray shield, which Kenobi noted to the rest of the group, leading Skywalker to become distressed as the ray shield wasn't originally in the plan. Continuing her climb, Tano noted that an opening was near the door and that she might be able to squeeze through the ventilation ducts and disable to ray shield. Skywalker then met her proposal with approval after an inquiry from Kenobi and she made her way to the shaft and entered, arriving just outside the ray shielded door. As she exited, she checked for any droid patrols, noticing none and made her way to the door controls, simply pressing a single button and deactivating the ray shield. As Skywalker, entered she tried to show off to him, noting that she could handle herself. However, as the rest of the group finished making their way up to the platform, a clone named \"Charger\" lost his grip on the cliff and began tumbling down towards the lava below, hitting an electromine on his way down and alerting the entire facility to the group's presence. With that, all security protocols were activated, the entire facility was placed on lockdown, and Sobeck's special units were assigned to hunt the group down.\n\nAs they stealthily made their way through the hallways of the facility, Tano served as a lookout as they traversed through said hallways. As they neared Piell's cell, Skywalker ordered ARC trooper CT-5555 \"Fives\" to take out their surveillance leading several automated laser traps to attack the group, although they were easily taken out by their combined efforts. However, an electrified wall soon activated, forcing the group to run to cover, and killing \"Longshot,\" not managing to take cover in time. Even so, Kenobi ordered for the group to keep moving. As Master Piell was being tortured, the group arrived just in time to save him before an EV-series medical droid would've removed his one remaining eye. As the group arrived, Skywalker freed Master Piell from his containment field while Kenobi cradled him back to the ground. As he stood back up, he confirmed he had not revealed the coordinates of the Nexus Route as Kenobi handed him his lightsaber back. However, Master Piell also confirmed that he only had half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route and that his captain had the other half, forcing the group to free them as well. With this, Skywalker was forced to come up with a new plan for escaping the facility and, with that, the group made their way to the second cell.\n\nAs they made their way there, Sobeck's special units\u2013six commando droids, specially designed with the logo of the Citadel on their armor plating\u2013arrived, surrounding the group and beginning their attack. During the battle, one of the commando droids tackled Tano and wrestled her to the ground before she managed to cut off its head, disabling it. Shortly afterward, Sobeck employed the use of ringing noise, distracting the group, and activating a magnetic field, allowing him to take their weapons and attracting Skywalker's cybernetic hand as Sobeck began to electrocute him, leading Tano to call out towards him. Soon after, more of Sobeck's special units arrived as Sobeck announced that they were going to be his \"guests\" for a very long time as they appeared to have been captured.\n\nHowever, Piell, Kenobi, and Tano used the Force to attempt to knock the droids over, but instead discovered that the droids were magnetized to the floor. Even so, the group continued this tactic, causing the droids' shots to miss their targets as the clones attempted to destroy them using their bare hands; however, the droids instead knocked them to the ground. As they did this, Skywalker managed to grab his lightsaber as Sobeck continued to electrify him and deactivate the magnetic field, returning each weapon to its respective group member and leading Skywalker to fall back towards the floor. With that, the group easily managed to destroy the commando droids as they continued their way towards the officers' cell. Before Rex left, he shot the camera Sobeck had been using to watch them, causing him to lose track of where they were.\n\nFinally arriving at their intended destination, the group opened the door as Tano swooped in from behind Skywalker, kicking one of the commando droids to the ground and eliminating it through the use of one of her lightsabers. As the rest of the group arrived in the cell, Tarkin, Piell's captain, noted their presence and asked how they were going to get out of the facility. With that, Kenobi offered a solution where he and Skywalker split up, assigning Piell and Tarkin to separate groups in case either was captured. Although briefly rejecting the idea, Tarkin eventually gave in after an inquiry from Piell and was assigned to Skywalker's group alongside Tano as Piell went with Kenobi's group. Kenobi's group intended to cause a distraction on their way to the landing pad to meet with their shuttle while Skywalker's group used the old fortress tunnels in order to maneuver around the facility and make it towards the pipeline where they too would be rescued by the shuttle.\n\nWhile Kenobi and Piell created a diversion, Skywalker, using old archive data, led his group to one of the tunnels in order to allow them to exit the facility. As they made their way out, Tano rushed ahead to make sure the tunnel was free of droids, discovering none and notifying the group as much. With that, Tano made her way back to the rest of the group as they traversed the old tunnel. As they continued to walk across the tunnel, Skywalker asked R2 if he and his battle droids were ready to depart as Tano surveyed the tunnel. Continuing to see if any droids occupied the tunnel, Tano continued to serve as a lookout for the group as a probe droid appeared, but was subsequently cut down by Skywalker before being able to alert Sobeck of their presence. After she looked towards the lava below, Tano openly questioned a sudden comment from Tarkin, who told her that he admired the design of the fortress. To this, Tarkin noted that the ongoing incident showed that it is effective at its job, but that it was a pity that the fortress had been captured by the Separatists, which Skywalker responded to Tano's responsive stare by telling her that Tarkin had a point. However, Tano gave him a bewildered look upon him saying this. With that, Skywalker informed Tano that he would be departing the group for a short while and that he needed her to lead it for the time being which led Tano to ask were he was going to which he noted that he needed to protect their flank since Kenobi was not with them. With that, Tano looked towards Skywalker and noted that it might have been a good thing she came after all while possessing a proud look on her face.\n\nAs they continued walking, Tarkin expressed his doubt in Tano's ability to lead the group to Rex to which Rex noted that he trusted her after the many missions the two had been on together. However, as the pair's conversation continued, the group came across a dead end in the tunnel. Just then, super battle droids began to appear from their flank, forcing Tano to activate her lightsabers and defend the group. As she did this, Skywalker swooped down and cut one of the super battle droids in half and did the same to the other. However commando droids, wielding personal energy shields, soon arrived, forcing them back into action. Tano then defended herself by saying that she thought it was a dead end, which ended up being to her detriment as Skywalker informed her that if Koon had indeed assigned her to the mission, he would've briefed her on the plan. However, Tano ignored this and instead ran to the wall and began placing thermal detonators onto it. Thinking that she had placed enough, she ran back into the action with two Class-A thermal detonators that had been leftover and used them to destroy the attacking commando droids as the wall blew up behind the group. With that, Tano walked past Skywalker, smiling at him, as the group continued its journey.\n\nArriving at the pipeline, Tano rushed ahead to gain a better perspective on it as Skywalker explained where the pipeline led and the plan for their escape. He then opened the hatch as the group had to shield their noses from the noxious fumes coming out of the pipeline. Tano then ventured into the pipeline, being the first to enter. As the group made it up the pipeline, Tano climbed from the outside and used her acrobatic skills to maneuver around and make it to the top of the pipeline. Cautiously skimming across it, Tano eventually stopped and informed the group that she thought she found a way out. Opening the hatch, she notified the group that there were no droids present as well as informing them that R2 had not yet arrived with the shuttle. As she attempted to climb out of the hatch, however, two battle droids pointed their blasters at her, but she easily managed to destroy them using her lightsabers, but soon discovered many more battle droids as well as crab droids advancing on their position. Even so, the group made their way out of the pipeline and towards the advancing droids. As Tarkin and the clones exited the pipeline, Tano and Skywalker defended them, deflecting as many of the droids' blaster bolts as was possible using their lightsabers. However, the group was soon forced to escape as they became overwhelmed by the number of droids. As Tano took cover along with the rest of the group, Skywalker took a thermal detonator and threw it at the hatch, closing it and destroying the entire pipeline along with the droids. With that, Skywalker informed them that they would now be following plan B, which was to meet up with the shuttle where Kenobi was supposed to be located.\n\nAs Skywalker's group arrived at the landing platform, they discovered Kenobi's group pinned down by several turrets surrounding the shuttle. In response to this, Skywalker's group was forced to take cover alongside Kenobi's group. While pinned down, Tano noted that the ship was surrounded to which Tarkin offered a solution in the way of a full-scale assault on the droids. However, Kenobi noted that if they did that the turrets would simply destroy the ship and their only chance of escape, but Tarkin offered up a counter solution where they take over the turrets and decimate the droids surrounding the shuttle. As they continued their conversation, Skywalker pointed out the STAPs headed for them as they began to fire upon them, destroying the crates behind them and forcing the four Jedi to ignite their lightsabers.\n\nThe Jedi managed to use this to their advantage, however, as Skywalker managed to grab hold of one of the STAPs in an attempt to destroy the turrets. However, more droid reinforcements continued to arrive alongside several commando droids, one of which climbed into one of the turrets and attempted to destroy the shuttle. Seeing this, ARC trooper CT-1409 \"Echo\" ran out into the open in an attempt to claim the shuttle, but the shuttle was instead destroyed and Echo was thought dead; however, the debris from the destruction of the shuttle managed to destroy the turret the commando droid was manning. With the shuttle now destroyed, the now once again combined group was forced to make a tactical retreat.\n\nAs the group escaped, Kenobi and Skywalker contacted the Jedi on Coruscant and informed them that they were going to need a rescue since their shuttle had been destroyed. Finally finding cover, Tano conversed with one of the rescued officers as Kenobi, Piell, and Skywalker discussed how they were going to make it to the rendezvous point and decided that they would just have to keep moving. With that, the group moved out, making their way towards the rendezvous point, believing that they still had a chance to escape.\n\nAs the group passed by a lava cave, Tano asked what the group's next move was to which Skywalker said that they were going to have to fight their way off of Lola Sayu, leading to Kenobi asking for someone to contact the Council and see when they were planning rescue them, which Piell took responsibility of. With that, R2 displayed a hologram of Windu who said that he was glad to see Piell alive. Skywalker then walked over to them and asked when they were planning on rescuing them to which Windu informed them that Koon had already left for Lola Sayu. Adding onto this, Yoda informed them that gunships would arrive to extract them, but that only a small window would be there for them to be rescued, so they had to the rendezvous point. Yoda then informed them where the rendezvous point would be\u2014a small island surrounded by lava. Windu then wished for the Force to be with them and ended the transmission. As the transmission ended, the group was ambushed by commando droids but easily destroyed them with the use of a timely thermal detonator from Fives. With that, the group moved out to reach the rendezvous point in time with Kenobi noting that more droids were surely on their way.\n\nThe group was soon discovered by Sobeck's droid forces, which led Tano to exclaim that the droids were boxing them in. In order to escape, Skywalker and Kenobi used their ascension guns to carry the members of the group with no weapon down the cliff they were in front of. While doing so, Tano defended them against the droids along with the rest of the group as R2 ordered for his droids to attack the enemy. The rest of the group took this opportunity to escape and used the ascension cables to carry themselves down the cliff. Finally making it to the surface, the commando droids continued to fire on them above after easily destroying R2's droids as the group attempted to make it through an opening into a cave while Cody and Skywalker covered their escape.\n\nAs they passed by a river of lava, Tarkin wondered aloud if the Jedi would be there when they arrived at the rendezvous point to which Piell said that, if he kept moving, he wouldn't have to worry about it. Looking back at Tarkin, Tano sneered and rolled her eyes at him before facing forward once more to continue moving. As she ducked under an outstretched rock, Tano asked why Piell had to share half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route with Tarkin, believing he wasn't grateful they had rescued him. In response, Skywalker informed her that Tarkin believed that the Jedi should not be in charge of leading the Grand Army of the Republic in the Clone Wars to which Tano said that his beliefs were ridiculous. Skywalker continued, debating with Kenobi about the role of the Jedi Code within war. As they continued walking, the group heard the howl of the anoobas, which led Tano to ask the rest of the group if they had heard the howl as well. Attempting to outrun the anoobas, Skywalker later told Tarkin that it was not wise to disobey Piell, especially for his career, while Tano watched. In response, Tarkin said that he stood by his principles no matter the circumstance and that his career was not to worry about since the chancellor favored him to which Skywalker said that he and the chancellor were also friends. However, Kenobi told them to hurry up or they'd miss their rendezvous and the two's conversation ended.\n\nNearing a cave, the anoobas had almost caught up with the group, which Fives noted. Skywalker then said that they would have to deal with them so that they did not lead the droids to them to which Tano offered the cave they had been nearing to launch a surprise attack on them. To this, Piell said that they might be able to get the anoobas to pass by, but they'd need a distraction in order to do so to which Skywalker offered himself up as well as Kenobi who inquired by the way of a fake cough. Tano then went with the rest of the group to hide in the cave as Kenobi and Skywalker walked with R2 through a misty path of rocks. As the anoobas arrived along with several commando droids riding STAPs, Tano and the rest of the group went to spring the trap; however, before they could arrive, crab droids appeared off the side of the cliff and attacked the group, quickly killing one of the liberated clones.\n\nPiell quickly managed to kill that crab droid, but more continued to arrive, leading Piell to order the clones to keep moving while he and Tano dealt with the crab droids. While defending against them, Tano used both of her lightsabers in order to defend against her crab droid while Piell easily managed to destroy his. Tano soon managed to destroy one of the other crab droids that had arrived while the two were overlooked by one of the anoobas. It quickly sprung into action and tackled Piell, forcing Tano to attempt to save him. Tano was too late, however, as, after using the Force to push the anooba away, Piell laid dying on the ground. As Tano reattached her lightsabers to her belt, she checked for Piell's vitals and exclaimed that she needed to get help, but was stopped by Piell who told her that he needed to tell her his half of the Nexus Route coordinates. Tano attempted to tell him that she should go get Skywalker or Kenobi, but Piell insisted that she hear them instead. To this, Tano admitted that she hadn't truly been assigned to the mission, but Piell did not care, informing her that now she was one of the most important pieces of the mission whether she was meant to be here or not and that she give his half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route only to the Jedi Council. With that, Piell gave Tano his half of the coordinates.\n\nAs the rest of the group finished off the remaining droids, Tano arrived carrying the dead body of Piell. As she carried him, she gave his body to Skywalker who laid him on the ground. With this, Tano informed them that Piell had died honorably and that she had his half of the coordinates. The group then brought him to a lavafall where Kenobi and Skywalker used the Force to drop his body into the lava and took a moment to honor him before they moved on. As the group continued their journey to the rendezvous point, they finally came across the island where they were meant to be extracted, Cody and Skywalker used their ascension guns to launch a cable so that they could climb over to the island as it was surrounded by lava. However, more commando droids then arrived on STAPs along with Sobeck, who had finally decided to deal with them himself.\n\nAs Sobeck was knocked out of the sky by Fives, he grabbed onto Tarkin and began to choke him, preparing to throw him into the lava. Acting on her training from Skywalker, Tano quickly killed him with her one of her lightsabers in order to save Tarkin. Tarkin then thanked Tano and informed Skywalker that he had trained her well. Just then, Koon finally arrived with the gunship as more crab droids arrived. Tano, as well as the rest of the group, easily managed to board the gunship and they took off while being flanked by Jedi Masters Saesee Tiin, Adi Gallia, and Kit Fisto flanking them in their own interceptors. As the Venators prepared to jump to hyperspace, the gunship safely made its way back into the hangar as Koon gave Admiral Barton Coburn the go-ahead to jump to hyperspace, leaving Lola Sayu behind.\n\n",

The 501st's leader was subsequently replaced by Jedi General Pong Krell, a Besalisk known for his high success rate in battle, but at an astonishingly high casualty rate. Shortly after taking command, Krell ordered the platoon, to march down the main road in an attempt to reach the Umbaran capital city as fast as possible, a decision that was looked upon as near suicide due to the likelihood of traps and ambushes from the Umbaran militia, which was highly active in the area.\n\nAlthough Clone Captain Rex protested the order, he resignedly led the platoon into battle. Before the platoon were able to make contact with enemy forces, they lost two soldiers to land mines placed by the insurgency. As expected, the militia attacked in force, resulting in heavy casualties to the platoon. The platoon retreated, taking losing even more troopers in the process. The depleted unit was eventually rescued by the main 501st as they withdrew from contact, angering Krell but saving the survivors of the platoon.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Undercover on Mandalore\n\nNot long after, Tano was dispatched to Mandalore on an undercover mission to uproot corruption scandals in the Mandalorian government and also to help educate Mandalore's youth, including the Duchess's nephew Korkie Kryze and his friends Amis, Lagos, and Soniee, on the basics of lawful and public-serving conduct. After being tasked with the job by Master Yoda, who believed a youthful Padawan could help get through to Mandalore, she was brought to Mandalore by Skywalker. Upon meeting the Duchess as well as Prime Minister Almec, she had to surrender her lightsaber due to restrictions on offworlders carrying weapons. A group of students led by Kryze, with her lessons in mind, proceeded to fight a black market conspiracy. They brought their findings to Tano, who urged them to be more careful. Kryze told her that he only wanted to help his planet like his aunt the Duchess did, but Tano cautioned him from getting into a problem that he could not fix on his own.\n\nWhen the cadets were arrested by the Mandalorian secret service on their way to meet with Alemc, Tano stepped in to save them. She assisted the cadets in uncovering the scheme and learned that it was actually controlled by Almec himself. However, when they went to alert Duchess Satine, they found her missing with her bodyguards dead. Tano concocted a plan to rescue her, using a mind trick to pass the guards, but Almec, who had been expecting her, stunned her as she tried to rescue the Duchess. When Almec attempted to force the Duchess to sign a confession of treason that would blame her for the black market operations, the cadets arrived and with Tano's help, took down Almec and his men. The conspirators were arrested and Tano left Mandalore shortly thereafter to return to the war.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Working with Senator Amidala\n\nSkywalker arranged an an engagement to escort Senator Amidala on a mission to the planet Alderaan. Unbeknownst to Tano and the Jedi Council, Skywalker and Amidala had secretly married shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis and planned to use this mission to spend time alone together. To her master's disgruntlement, however, Tano was also assigned to the mission at the suggestion of Kenobi, who had some understanding of the couple's close relationship.\n\nBoarding a T-6 shuttle, the trio departed from Coruscant and made the jump to hyperspace. Now wanting the mission to end as soon as possible, Skywalker changed the ship's flight trajectory to travel along a different route. Tano warned her master that they would pass through a sector of suspected Separatist activity, and when the ship pulled out of hyperspace, true to the Padawan's word, they were met with five Munificent-class star frigates. At the senator's command, Amidala and Tano manned the guns as Skywalker flew through the Confederate fleet.\n\nAlthough the Jedi Knight's flying skills managed to get the ship through most of the fleet, one of the frigates was able to land a blow on the Republic shuttle, knocking the senator to the floor. As the smoke in the shuttle cleared, Tano saw that Skywalker had caught Amidala, who held her husband tightly in her arms. Seeing that the two were preoccupied, Tano took to the pilot's seat and managed to safely bring the ship to Alderaan. After landing, Skywalker thanked his Padawan for her help before leaving her and the senator alone. The two women shared a moment together, acknowledging the other's relationship with Skywalker.\n\nIn the Jedi Temple dojo, Tano and Padawan Barriss Offee had a training session and practiced lightsaber combat. As they spared, Offee used the Force to push Tano to the floor. Seeing an opportunity, Tano threw one of her lightsabers at Offee, catching the Mirialan off guard. Jumping up and igniting her remaining lightsaber, Tano brought Offee to yield, ending the match. Offee said that it was not a good match, stating that Tano would not have thrown her weapon in a real battle and that she had learned nothing from the session.\n\nThe two walked from the dojo and spoke about the differences between their masters' teachings. When Offee accused Tano of losing patience and forgetting the lightsaber forms, Tano replied by saying that the forms did not help her in real battles. Tano handed her lightsabers to Offee, who then demonstrated how using Form VI would have helped her. When they arrived at Tano's quarters, she thanked Offee for the match, and they parted ways.\n\nIn her quarters, Tano tried the lightsaber forms but was unsuccessful. To clear her mind, she sat down and began to meditate. As she meditated, she thought about how Offee had been right, and she determined that she needed to think like a Jedi and that she still was not good enough. Tano's meditation was interrupted when Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala knocked on the door, and Tano invited her inside.\n\nTano was surprised to see Amidala at the Temple and asked if everything was alright. Amidala explained that she was going to host an important meeting with the Arthurian delegates the next day, and the senator asked Tano if she would perform a security check. Tano doubted that Amidala needed her, saying that Captain Typho and the handmaidens would be enough. But thinking back to her training session with Offee, Tano ultimately agreed to the job.\n\nThe following evening, Tano established a perimeter around Amidala's apartment and assured the senator that the outside of the building was clear. Amidala thanked the Padawan and requested that she stay for the meeting, well aware that her negotiations with the delegates from Arthuria were opposed by many. Tano politely declined, however, not wanting to interfere in the dealings of politicians.\n\nBefore she could leave, Tano noticed that the banquet table that one of the Senator's handmaidens had prepared was set with utensils, which were customarily never used by Arthurians. When Amidala questioned the handmaiden for the potentially offensive act, the servant pulled out a blaster and fired upon the duo. As Tano confronted the handmaiden, she revealed herself to be Cato Parasitti, the same shape-shifting assassin whom Tano had encountered during Cad Bane's heist at the Jedi Temple. After a small fire fight, Tano was able to subdue Parasitti and dispose of a bomb the changeling had planted in the apartment.",

        "content": "# Rex's battle strategy algorithm - History[]\n\nRex developed the algorithm, with only Fives and Echo also aware of its existence, some time before the Battle of Lola Sayu. With Echo's apparent death in an explosion during the action on Lola Sayu and Fives' later death on Coruscant after having allegedly gone insane, Rex was seemingly the only person alive who knew of the algorithm's existence. However, Echo had not actually died at the Citadel. Severely injured in the explosion of the Sheathipede-class Type B shuttle he had been attempting to reclaim, he was salvaged by the Separatists, eventually winding up in the hands of the Techno Union. He was turned into a cyborg, and the Union extracted information from his brain, allowing them to use him to work out the algorithm. Kept in stasis in a facility in Purkoll on Skako Minor, he was unaware of his surroundings or what was happening to him.\n\nWhen the campaign for control of the planet Anaxes began, Admiral Trench, in command of the Separatist forces, had the algorithm transmitted from Skako Minor to a Cyber Center constructed on Anaxes' surface, where he could review it from his flagship. Over the course of several weeks, the Republic's hold on the planet began to slip away, with their forces sustaining unusual losses. Captain Rex believed that the Separatists were somehow using his strategies and algorithm, and came to the conclusion that Echo was the only possible way the enemy could have gotten a hold of them, meaning that he might still be alive. He and Clone Commander Cody came forward to Jedi Generals Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker with the theory that the Separatists had somehow figured out how to counter Rex, but the Captain was loath to admit his idea that Echo was still alive as he thought the Jedi might think he was crazy for suggesting it. Rex and Cody received permission to lead a strike team behind enemy lines to the Cyber Center to find out how they were being countered.\n\nCody called in Clone Force 99, an irregular unit of clone commandos informally known as the \"Bad Batch,\" to participate in the mission alongside himself, Rex, ARC trooper Jesse, and clone medic Kix. When let in on the theory that Echo was still alive, Cody was skeptical. En route, the gunship the strike team was travelling was shot down, leaving Cody severely injured and Rex in charge of the mission, as Kix stayed behind with Cody to wait for an evac. Upon breaching the Cyber Center in a two-pronged attack, Tech of the Bad Batch accessed the center's computers and found that the algorithm was a live transmission instead of a stored program. Digging deeper, Tech found a transmission of Echo's voice, and when Rex asked for the voice's identity, the response was Echo's identification number, CT-1409, proving he was alive.\n\nThe discovery led Rex, Skywalker, and the Bad Batch to launch an unsanctioned mission to Skako Minor to rescue Echo from the Techno Union. Despite heavy resistance from battle droids, and Trench having warned Wat Tambor that the infiltration was likely, the strike team was able to get to Echo and release him from the stasis chamber. After Tambor's battle droids failed to recapture Echo, Tambor decided to hold off on informing the Separatist military of the loss as he wanted to find a way to recoup the lost profits that the ARC trooper's escape represented.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - First Battle of Felucia and protecting the archives\n\nTano, Skywalker, and Kenobi were later dispatched to Felucia to participate in the First Battle of Felucia against Separatist forces. Unfortunately, they were vastly outnumbered, and the Republic sent an evacuation squad led by Plo Koon that was sent to retrieve them after the Separatists managed to establish a blockade above the planet, entrapping them on Felucia's surface. Despite instructions from both Kenobi and Skywalker to retreat, Tano continued to engage the battle droids, intent on continuing the offensive and refusing to back down. However, she eventually relented after her master ordered Tano and her troops to get inside his gunship. Moments later, the clone turbo tank that she had previously been standing on was destroyed by the droids, making Tano realize that she would have died had she not retreated.\n\nAs a result of her actions during the battle, Tano was brought before the Jedi High Council. Tano admitted that she had been wrong not to retreat immediately, stating that she had been \"caught in the moment.\" Though Skywalker tried to take responsibility for the incident, arguing that he had given Tano \"too much freedom,\" Master Windu dismissed his argument and had Tano sent to the Jedi archives for guard duty to work alongside master Jocasta Nu, in order to allow her time to reflect on her disobedient actions. When Tano asked how long she would be on guard duty, Windu responded by extending the punishment.\n\nTano was about to see more action than expected, as the skilled bounty hunters Cad Bane and Clawdite Cato Parasitti, disguised as recently deceased Jedi Ord Enisence, had infiltrated the Temple with the goal of obtaining a holocron from the vaults. Alerted to the presence of the infiltrators by Master Yoda over her comlink, Tano confronted Parasitti, now disguised as Jocasta Nu, and engaged her in a short lightsaber battle. Tano easily defeated the inexperienced Clawdite, taking her into her custody. However, Bane completed his mission and stole a holocron. The Jedi were given a clue towards finding him when the captured Parasitti told them that Bane's next objective involved the keeper of the kyber memory crystal Bolla Ropal. As Kenobi remained on Coruscant to search for Bane, Tano and Skywalker headed to the Devaron system to catch the bounty hunter.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Battle of Bothawui and search for R2-D2\n\nFollowing the Republic's defeat at Falleen, Tano, Skywalker and their fleet were stationed at Bothawui to protect it. Tano agreed with Kenobi that they should retreat, but stood by her master when he refused to do so. Tano was part of Resolute command as Skywalker, R2, and Gold Squadron engaged Grievous's fleet. As Grievous's fleet hit them, Tano signaled Rex and his AT-TEs to open fire from the asteroids behind Grievous's fleet. Though they destroyed the bulk of Grievous's fleet, Grievous himself escaped.\n\nAfter Skywalker was injured when his starfighter collided with a large piece of shrapnel, he was brought to the Resolute to recover, though R2 was left behind. Tano later accompanied her master along with R2's temporary replacement R3-S6, secretly a spy for General Grievous, on a subsequent salvage operation to try and recover the droid. Tano was optimistic R3 would be a suitable replacement but failed to convince Skywalker that R3 could ever replace R2. The pair boarded a nearby salvaging ship piloted by the Trandoshan scavenger Gha Nachkt. R3, secretly in league with the Separatists, activated several IG-88 assassin droids, which attacked the two Jedi within the ship's cargo hold. After failing to find R2, they left to continue their search, unaware that Nachkt was also in league with Grievous and was secretly hiding R2 from the Jedi. After Skywalker was caught in an ambush by Grievous as a result of R3's sabotage, Tano and Rex were forced to rescue him, once again escaping the General's clutches. Tano continued to stick up for R3, but this only made Skywalker angrier since they were no closer to finding R2.\n\nUpon receiving a transmission from R2 aboard Gha Nachkt's ship, Tano and Skywalker followed the transmission coordinates to Grievous's Separatist listening post on one of Ruusan's moons. To avoid the station's scanners, Tano, Skywalker, R3, Rex, Denal, and several other clones skydived from the Twilight onto the station's surface, gaining entry via lightsaber. Once inside, Skywalker went to rescue R2 while Tano and the clones began to plant explosives all around the station. However, as Tano and the clones advanced through the station, they were found by a force of droids and were pinned down. Unbeknownst to them, R3 was the one who contacted Grievous to help him locate the infiltration team. After they defeated the enemy, Grievous personally came to attack them. While Tano initially remained confident that they could defeat him like the other droids, Grievous quickly overpowered her before he killed all of the troopers save Rex and Denal. Before he could deal a killing blow to Rex, his strike was parried by Tano's own lightsaber, and the two engaged in a duel. Far outmatched by the cyborg General, Tano retreated into another room full of spare droid parts along with R3. As she hid, she contacted Rex and ordered him to proceed with the mission and continue to plant explosives with Denal while she distracted Grievous. Then, she was discovered and ambushed by Grievous thanks to the betrayal of R3. She escaped into the ventilation shaft and rendezvoused with the rest of the crew at the hangar and saw that R2 had been rescued. They escaped on board the Twilight, this time with R2, just as the station exploded.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Escape from Oba Diah\n\nWhen both of them were working on Trace's freighter in the repair shop, Tano continued to hide her past from the Martez sister by claiming she had gone to \"Skywalker Academy.\" Although the mechanic had never heard of the fake school, she believed it was real, having never truly heard of any academy. When Tano asked why she would never have attended one of the schools, the mechanic noted that there were none where they lived, and that she would not be able to afford it. Trace then stated Rafa and her inherited the hangar the repair shop was in, claiming their parents had \"split,\" and that Rafa had won her store gambling. However, Trace had built her freighter herself, telling Tano its name was the Silver Angel. Although Tano chuckled at the name, she told Trace she could call her starship whatever name she desired, and secret Force-sensitive returned to work on her speeder bike, which Trace had dubbed \"Trash.\" After talking about where she would go once the speeder was fixed, Tano accepted Trace's suggestion to stay a for short time longer, as long as Rafa did not mind. At that moment Rafa entered the shop and was told that Tano would be staying. After asking what skills the former Padawan had, Tano stated she only had useful ones.\n\nRafa entered to tell her sister that a crew and starship she had hired had backed out of a job. Although Trace was annoyed her sibling had hired a pilot other than herself, Rafa now needed her sister and her freighter. Although Tano asked what the job was, Rafa refused to answer her until they had left, and Trace accepted the task. Rafa reminded her sister that they could not rely on anyone's help, seeing that Trace was beginning to trust Tano. After her sister had entered the Silver Angel, though, Rafa confronted Tano and asked what she was looking for. The former Padawan stated she did not have, as Rafa put it, an \"angle,\" unless maybe to keep the two siblings out of trouble. Rafa and her then entered the ship, but not without the older sibling implying Tano could be the trouble Trace needed to avoid. Now with all three inside the cockpit, the Silver Angel took off from the underworld portal, but Trace flew the ship into a restricted military lane. The Angel was soon hailed by a Star Destroyer that had both Skywalker and Yularen, the same admiral Tano had served with, aboard. While the admiral was willing to send a detachment aboard to arrest the Angel's crew, Skywalker and Tano sensed each other, so the Jedi Knight elected to let her and the Silver Angel continue on their way.\n\nNow in open space, Tano noted that Rafa had yet to tell her and Trace where they were going. In response, Rafa only told her sister about their destination before they jumped to lightspeed. During their journey, however, Trace had forgotten to disengage the air brakes, making the Angel rumble, and Trace noted she had never been to hyperspace. Tano then learned that her friend had only ever piloted smaller vehicles meant for use on planets, allowing Rafa to quietly explain why she had wanted a different pilot. Once Tano pointed out the rumbling, Trace remembered to disable the air brakes, and the three finally arrived at the Akkadese Maelstrom, a massive cluster of debris and gas that surrounded their destination, the Outer Rim world of Kessel. Realizing they were heading to a planet infamous for its corruption, Tano asked Rafa what their job was. Rafa stated they were picking up medicine and tried to calm the former Padawan's worries when they reached the lush section of the planet. The three young women arrived at King Yaruba's palace, where they were greeted by his majordomo, Kinash Lock. Tano and the sisters were brought to a banquet, but, after learning the medicine was three containers of unrefined spice, the Force-sensitive noted that the substance could be used in illegal products. Lock denied her allegation, claiming their spice was used for medicine during the current time of war and that the Yaruba Family had always supported spreading health and joy.\n\nAs they left the palace, Tano tried to argue their mission was dangerous, as pirates often attacked Kessel transport craft, but Rafa believed the Angel was too small for any raiders to realize what their cargo was. Tano refused to yield, noting that pirates could deduce what they were carrying because they were leaving Kessel, and, to keep her past a secret, claimed she knew this from stories. The Martez sister simply responded that it meant she should have faith in Trace's piloting skills and boarded their freighter. Before Trace could join her sibling, Tano stopped her, telling her that she believed Rafa had wanted a different pilot because of the possible danger, but the pilot felt her sister had faith in her abilities. After Tano learned this was likely Rafa's first time running spice, she asked Trace how her sister could know what they were facing, but the pilot simply felt there was a first time for every task. With this, the two boarded the Angel, and the three young women traveled to the mining zone of Kessel, which more closely resembled the version of the planet Tano was familiar with. As they neared a landing platform, the three looked down to see what Trace initially thought were droids Yaruba had purchased, but Tano quickly realized the laborers toiling below them were slaves. Rafa disagreed, believing the Republic would not allow an operation as large as Kessel's to remain active, but Tano quietly noted that was not what the government would do.\n\nTano joined the Martez sisters on the loading platform before heading back on the Angel to make sure the spice bins were secured. Before Trace could join her friend, Rafa confided to her sister that she did not know how to feel about their new partner, reminding her younger sister that Tano was not family. Though annoyed by her sister's thoughts on Tano, Trace stated she would keep an eye on her friend before both went aboard. When the Angel jumped to hyperspace, however, Tano learned they were to deliver the spice to the Pyke crime lord Marg Krim on Oba Diah. Though Rafa questioned how the supposed mechanic knew about the Pyke Syndicate, Tano avoided the question and asserted that they could not make a deal with gangsters, warning Trace that the Pykes would take everything from her and kill her. As the pilot panicked at the thought of losing her starship, Tano, who felt they should take the spice to somewhere that would use it for medicine, debated what to do with their shipment with Rafa, who stated she needed the money to pay debts they owed on Coruscant, though Tano believed these debts had nothing to do with Trace. Determined to keep the Silver Angel and make sure neither Tano nor Rafa got their way, Trace suddenly dumped the spice containers into hyperspace, to the surprise of both her sister and the former Padawan, who had viewed her debate as an ethical discussion and had yet to figure out a way to settle their deal.\n\nRafa reprimanded Tano and Trace for their similarities and suggested paying off the Pykes by selling the Angel, but the former Padawan broke up the sisters' argument, reminding them that she had said she'd not figured out a plan \"yet.\" Trace quickly responded by asking if she had one now, which Tano stated they would find out once they acted. She told the sisters to pretend to drop the spice by giving the Pykes empty crates and that they would then flee the planet. Though both Trace and Rafa disliked her idea, neither had a better plan, and Tano also knew she had the Force at her disposal. When the trio arrived on Oba Diah, they were greeted by Krim, who had been waiting for them, his majordomo Fife, and a force of armed Pyke guards. The crime lord withheld Rafa's payment, intending to verify they had brought him the spice, but Tano used a mind trick on the Pyke and his entourage, persuading Krim to give Rafa her credits and let them leave. Unfortunately for them, Fife was not as weak-minded as his peers and grew suspicious. As Tano prepared the Angel's engines, Rafa avoided giving Fife the bin password by claiming they had already transmitted it. The majordomo was not convinced and, after blasting open the case, saw that the three had tricked them. As the trio tried to escape on the Angel, they were caught in a tractor beam and surrounded by Pyke forces. Seeing that they were trapped, Rafa said she would blame everything on Tano, although Trace noted all three of them had played a part in their current situation.\n\nTano and the sisters were imprisoned deep within the Pyke Palace for their actions, where Tano and Rafa continued to debate what they should have done. Rafa joked that Tano's morals made her sound like a Jedi, making her question what they would do if she was a member of the Order. Though Trace told them not to jest about the subject, Rafa realized her sister had never told Tano why they avoided the Jedi and other \"Topsiders.\" Unwilling to have the secret Force-sensitive argue about morality, she recounted that, during Cad Bane's rescue of Ziro the Hutt several years earlier, the bounty hunter shot the engines of a cargo transport rising through an underworld portal to distract a team of pursuing Jedi. Trying to stop the starship from crashing into a populated landing platform, the Jedi instead steered it into the portal wall, the other side of which contained the Martez home. Their mother and father managed to get the siblings out of harm's way, but they were caught and killed in the crash.\n\nAfter failing to capture Bane, Ziro, and the other criminals, the Jedi returned, and Rafa revealed one of the Force-sensitives, Tano's old acquaintance Luminara Unduli, came over to her, telling Rafa that she had needed to make a choice about the transport. She then stated that the Force would be with them, but the religious belief meant nothing to Martez sister. The Jedi then left, leaving the two alone to find a way to survive. Rafa recounted that she had spent every day since trying to build a new life for herself and Trace, believing they had been fine until her sister let Tano come with them.\n\nTano apologized for what had happened to them, but the three young women were interrupted by the Pyke guards, who demanded Rafa come with them. While Tano stood in front of the sisters to try to protect them and Rafa offered that they instead take Tano, the Pykes pushed past the former Padawan and Trace, taking the elder sister away for interrogation. As Rafa was tortured, Trace and Tano were left in the cell, where the mechanic admitted she and her sister had been on their own until Tano arrived. Trace also revealed she had helped her because it was something her mother would have believed in. Rafa, unconscious but having refused to give up information, was then thrown into the cell by the Pyke guards. Though Tano advised her friend to not make the Pykes angry, Trace demanded they tell her what had happened to Rafa and shoved a guard, who grabbed the mechanic to take her away for interrogation.\n\nTano objected to the action, but was hit down by a guard's stun baton, making her fall to the ground. Trace called for her friend to make sure Rafa was well before being taken to the interrogation room, where she pretended to faint to distract the guards, using the opportunity to steal a CC-420 pistol and escape the room, although several guards pursued her. After noticing the Pykes run down the hallway, Tano secretly used the Force to unlock the door before waking Rafa. Informing the Martez sister that the Pykes had taken Trace and that they needed to flee, they escaped the cell, which the secret Force user claimed was opened by a power outage. As they searched for Trace, they eventually ran into the escaping mechanic, who had been heading back to the cell to break them out.\n\nReunited, the three made their way to an outside platform, and Trace blasted a barrel Tano and Rafa had knocked over to clear away the pursuing guards. Their next challenge came from a retracting bridge; although Rafa made it across in time, Tano had to use the Force to help push Trace across, and, while Rafa was willing to leave Tano behind, she was able to Force jump over the gap. While the older Martez sister recognized that it had not been a normal feat, they nevertheless needed the run from two more Pykes guards, who had arrived just before Trace made it across the bridge. The three made their way to the city gate, during which time Tano helped the sisters take out a Pyke guard in order to steal his stun baton, and she continued to debate their situation with Rafa.\n\nUnderstanding that the syndicate's reputation was at stake, the former Padawan recognized that the Pykes had no desire to let them escape, so Rafa had Tano head to disable the gate while she and Trace went to distract the guards. The Martez sister claimed to give Tano the job because of her resourcefulness, though the former Padawan also believed it was because Rafa thought it was more difficult. As her friend left for the control tower, Trace speculated that her sister and Tano were getting along better, but Rafa denied that. Tano was able to sneak into the control tower and managed to dispatch the control room's guards in physical combat, but she quickly saw that the Martez sisters had gotten into a firefight with the Pykes outside. After opening the gates and traveling down, she secretly used the Force to pull the two guards into the open, giving Trace the chance to shoot both of them. Tano then called the sisters forward, and the three young women escaped into the city.\n\nAfter Trace, believing she saw the Silver Angel, excitedly ran past the two of them, Tano and Rafa were given the chance to talk in private about whether Trace should be involved in criminal jobs. Rafa changed the topic to question Tano about why she was interested in helping, although they were soon interrupted by a begging Gotal. Rafa claimed to have no credits, and she and Tano left him so they could catch up to Trace. Once they had, Rafa again asked what she wanted, so Tano informed the Martez sister that she made it her duty to help those in need, a trait that Rafa admitted sounded like her mother. She confided in Tano that she was simply trying to do what was best for her sister and herself. Trace then informed her friend and sister that she had in fact found the Angel, but the trio was spotted by the Pykes, who had been helped in their search by the angered Gotal beggar, after Trace and Rafa had argued about whether to use the Angel to escape. The three ran through the crowded street while pursued and under blaster fire, unknowingly attracting the attention of a hooded Mandalorian Nite Owl, who was on planet for a mission with Bo-Katan Kryze, the very Death Watch lieutenant Tano had fought during the battle on Carlac earlier in the war.\n\nWhile trying to escape the Pyke guards by riding on a civilian's landspeeder, one of the syndicate soldiers blasted out one of the craft's engines, throwing Rafa and Trace off the vehicle while pushing Tano further away from the Pykes. As the sisters were captured, Tano continued to escape through the city, unknowingly being watched by Kryze, who was unsure if the Force-sensitive was in fact Tano, Ursa Wren, and a third Mandalorian Nite Owl. Although Wren feared her presence could compromise their mission on Oba Diah, Kryze also recognized that they shared an enemy in the rogue Sith Lord Maul, who still had control over Mandalore. Thus, Kryze decided they would keep track of the former Padawan's movements.\n\nElsewhere, Tano watched over Rafa and Trace from a building-top, learning that Krim and Fife intended to kill the two sisters before torturing her to learn where the spice was. After discretely taking out a guard, the former Padawan took control of a construction vehicle, interrupting the planned execution by ramming the repulsorcraft into the Pykes and using its frontal cannons. Although she cleared away most of the Pyke guards in their path, Fife\u2014who had purposely drawn Tano into a trap with the execution\u2014returned with a cannon-equipped landspeeder. The cannon downed Tano's replusorcraft, preventing their escape and allowing them to be subsequently surrounded by Pyke guards.\n\nTano and the sisters were escorted back to their cell, with one of the guards shoving the secret Force-sensitive into the confinement. Rafa tried to arrange a deal, but Krim denied the three the chance at another job and stated his intention to torture them until he learned where the spice was. Once all but one of the guards left, Rafa apologized for taking the job, so Tano told the young woman that she would learn from the experience. Nevertheless, Trace asked her sister and friend how much longer they would be alive to learn those lessons.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Rescuing Even Piell\n\nAs the group passed by a lava cave, Tano asked what the group's next move was to which Skywalker said that they were going to have to fight their way off of Lola Sayu, leading to Kenobi asking for someone to contact the Council and see when they were planning rescue them, which Piell took responsibility of. With that, R2 displayed a hologram of Windu who said that he was glad to see Piell alive. Skywalker then walked over to them and asked when they were planning on rescuing them to which Windu informed them that Koon had already left for Lola Sayu. Adding onto this, Yoda informed them that gunships would arrive to extract them, but that only a small window would be there for them to be rescued, so they had to the rendezvous point. Yoda then informed them where the rendezvous point would be\u2014a small island surrounded by lava. Windu then wished for the Force to be with them and ended the transmission. As the transmission ended, the group was ambushed by commando droids but easily destroyed them with the use of a timely thermal detonator from Fives. With that, the group moved out to reach the rendezvous point in time with Kenobi noting that more droids were surely on their way.\n\nThe group was soon discovered by Sobeck's droid forces, which led Tano to exclaim that the droids were boxing them in. In order to escape, Skywalker and Kenobi used their ascension guns to carry the members of the group with no weapon down the cliff they were in front of. While doing so, Tano defended them against the droids along with the rest of the group as R2 ordered for his droids to attack the enemy. The rest of the group took this opportunity to escape and used the ascension cables to carry themselves down the cliff. Finally making it to the surface, the commando droids continued to fire on them above after easily destroying R2's droids as the group attempted to make it through an opening into a cave while Cody and Skywalker covered their escape.\n\nAs they passed by a river of lava, Tarkin wondered aloud if the Jedi would be there when they arrived at the rendezvous point to which Piell said that, if he kept moving, he wouldn't have to worry about it. Looking back at Tarkin, Tano sneered and rolled her eyes at him before facing forward once more to continue moving. As she ducked under an outstretched rock, Tano asked why Piell had to share half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route with Tarkin, believing he wasn't grateful they had rescued him. In response, Skywalker informed her that Tarkin believed that the Jedi should not be in charge of leading the Grand Army of the Republic in the Clone Wars to which Tano said that his beliefs were ridiculous. Skywalker continued, debating with Kenobi about the role of the Jedi Code within war. As they continued walking, the group heard the howl of the anoobas, which led Tano to ask the rest of the group if they had heard the howl as well. Attempting to outrun the anoobas, Skywalker later told Tarkin that it was not wise to disobey Piell, especially for his career, while Tano watched. In response, Tarkin said that he stood by his principles no matter the circumstance and that his career was not to worry about since the chancellor favored him to which Skywalker said that he and the chancellor were also friends. However, Kenobi told them to hurry up or they'd miss their rendezvous and the two's conversation ended.\n\nNearing a cave, the anoobas had almost caught up with the group, which Fives noted. Skywalker then said that they would have to deal with them so that they did not lead the droids to them to which Tano offered the cave they had been nearing to launch a surprise attack on them. To this, Piell said that they might be able to get the anoobas to pass by, but they'd need a distraction in order to do so to which Skywalker offered himself up as well as Kenobi who inquired by the way of a fake cough. Tano then went with the rest of the group to hide in the cave as Kenobi and Skywalker walked with R2 through a misty path of rocks. As the anoobas arrived along with several commando droids riding STAPs, Tano and the rest of the group went to spring the trap; however, before they could arrive, crab droids appeared off the side of the cliff and attacked the group, quickly killing one of the liberated clones.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Escape from Oba Diah\n\nAs they left the palace, Tano tried to argue their mission was dangerous, as pirates often attacked Kessel transport craft, but Rafa believed the Angel was too small for any raiders to realize what their cargo was. Tano refused to yield, noting that pirates could deduce what they were carrying because they were leaving Kessel, and, to keep her past a secret, claimed she knew this from stories. The Martez sister simply responded that it meant she should have faith in Trace's piloting skills and boarded their freighter. Before Trace could join her sibling, Tano stopped her, telling her that she believed Rafa had wanted a different pilot because of the possible danger, but the pilot felt her sister had faith in her abilities. After Tano learned this was likely Rafa's first time running spice, she asked Trace how her sister could know what they were facing, but the pilot simply felt there was a first time for every task. With this, the two boarded the Angel, and the three young women traveled to the mining zone of Kessel, which more closely resembled the version of the planet Tano was familiar with. As they neared a landing platform, the three looked down to see what Trace initially thought were droids Yaruba had purchased, but Tano quickly realized the laborers toiling below them were slaves. Rafa disagreed, believing the Republic would not allow an operation as large as Kessel's to remain active, but Tano quietly noted that was not what the government would do.\n\nTano joined the Martez sisters on the loading platform before heading back on the Angel to make sure the spice bins were secured. Before Trace could join her friend, Rafa confided to her sister that she did not know how to feel about their new partner, reminding her younger sister that Tano was not family. Though annoyed by her sister's thoughts on Tano, Trace stated she would keep an eye on her friend before both went aboard. When the Angel jumped to hyperspace, however, Tano learned they were to deliver the spice to the Pyke crime lord Marg Krim on Oba Diah. Though Rafa questioned how the supposed mechanic knew about the Pyke Syndicate, Tano avoided the question and asserted that they could not make a deal with gangsters, warning Trace that the Pykes would take everything from her and kill her. As the pilot panicked at the thought of losing her starship, Tano, who felt they should take the spice to somewhere that would use it for medicine, debated what to do with their shipment with Rafa, who stated she needed the money to pay debts they owed on Coruscant, though Tano believed these debts had nothing to do with Trace. Determined to keep the Silver Angel and make sure neither Tano nor Rafa got their way, Trace suddenly dumped the spice containers into hyperspace, to the surprise of both her sister and the former Padawan, who had viewed her debate as an ethical discussion and had yet to figure out a way to settle their deal.\n\nRafa reprimanded Tano and Trace for their similarities and suggested paying off the Pykes by selling the Angel, but the former Padawan broke up the sisters' argument, reminding them that she had said she'd not figured out a plan \"yet.\" Trace quickly responded by asking if she had one now, which Tano stated they would find out once they acted. She told the sisters to pretend to drop the spice by giving the Pykes empty crates and that they would then flee the planet. Though both Trace and Rafa disliked her idea, neither had a better plan, and Tano also knew she had the Force at her disposal. When the trio arrived on Oba Diah, they were greeted by Krim, who had been waiting for them, his majordomo Fife, and a force of armed Pyke guards. The crime lord withheld Rafa's payment, intending to verify they had brought him the spice, but Tano used a mind trick on the Pyke and his entourage, persuading Krim to give Rafa her credits and let them leave. Unfortunately for them, Fife was not as weak-minded as his peers and grew suspicious. As Tano prepared the Angel's engines, Rafa avoided giving Fife the bin password by claiming they had already transmitted it. The majordomo was not convinced and, after blasting open the case, saw that the three had tricked them. As the trio tried to escape on the Angel, they were caught in a tractor beam and surrounded by Pyke forces. Seeing that they were trapped, Rafa said she would blame everything on Tano, although Trace noted all three of them had played a part in their current situation.",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Christophsis[]\n\nSeven weeks into the war, Rex and Cody were dispatched with a Republic battle group under the command of Skywalker and Kenobi to liberate the planet Christophsis, which had fallen to the Confederacy and its Retail Caucus conglomerate. En route to Christophsis aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, Rex witnessed a holographic broadcast alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody in which General Whorm Loathsom, the leader of the enemy invasion, pressured the Christophsian populace into submitting to Separatist rule. After reaching the Christoph system, the Republic forces defeated Confederate Admiral Trench's naval blockade and established a base on the surface.\n\nSkywalker and Kenobi then took a clone contingent led by Rex and Cody into the capital, Chaleydonia, more commonly known as Crystal City. Once there, the Jedi and clones prepared an ambush to offset the Confederacy's advantage in troop strength. They moved into a business complex with two north- and south-facing towers, from which they intended to intercept a Separatist droid battalion set to pass through the major plaza below. Rex and Skywalker stationed their men in the north tower's forty-sixth level, while that of the south tower housed the detail led by Kenobi, Cody, and Clone Sergeant Slick.\n\nAs the Separatist battalion commanded by the T-series tactical droid TJ-55 marched through the business complex's plaza, the troop column unexpectedly split in half. The Republic's strategy was thus compromised when numerous B1-Series battle droid squads ambushed Kenobi's men in the south tower. After signaling clone trooper pilot Hawk for an evacuation, Skywalker, Rex, and their men used their DC-15A blaster rifles' ascension cables to rappel over to the south tower. They avoided laser fire from the droid infantry below and arrived to reinforce Kenobi and Cody, who were holding out against overwhelming numbers. Once Kenobi temporarily impeded the droids' advance by Force-pushing a blaster cannon at them, the combined clone detachment took a turbolift to the roof for their evacuation. TJ-55 pursued them to the roof with more droid troops, and Rex, Cody, and the clones provided cover fire for Skywalker and Kenobi to cut through the droids. Hawk's LAAT/i gunship soon arrived, and Rex and his comrades escaped with TJ-55's cranial unit, which trooper Gus had pilfered.\n\nBack at the base that night, Rex and Cody analyzed TJ-55's cranial unit in the command center under a robolobotomy, but they only confirmed that the Confederacy had been aware of their plan before the unit stopped processing. Upon being apprised of their clone officers' findings, Skywalker suggested that a security breach was the cause for the Separatists' acquisition of their strategy, but Kenobi went so far as to suspect that there was a spy among their men. Skywalker and Kenobi decided to investigate behind enemy lines, ordering Rex and Cody to keep their mission confidential and remain behind to apprehend the potential traitor.\n\nShortly after the Jedi departed, Cody was alarmed to find a Hush-98 comlink deliberately left activated on a nearby table with the troops' other equipment, indicating that someone had remotely eavesdropped on their conversation with the Jedi. Rex then noticed a figure in the hallway too far away to be identified: Sergeant Slick, who had become a spy for the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress and the Confederacy out of a grudge against the Jedi. Slick immediately broke into a run and ignored Rex's commands to halt, forcing Rex and Cody to pursue him through the base. Despite losing their target, the two officers were able to follow his path through the complex's hallways to the clones' mess hall, where they realized that the traitor was one of their own brethren.\n\nReturning to the command center, Rex and Cody attempted to contact Skywalker and Kenobi but found that communications were being blocked, potentially by the spy in their camp. Rex resolved to use Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, to check the station's outgoing transmission logs from the past few days. Musing through R2-D2's findings with a datapad, Rex traced an odd spike in wavelength interference to a computer terminal located in the barracks of Slick's unit. Inferring that one of Slick's men was the spy, Rex and Cody decided to individually interrogate the platoon's members despite protest from Slick.\n\nThough troopers Jester, Punch, Sketch, and Gus all passed interrogation with credible alibis, trooper Chopper was forced to reveal that he had broken war protocols by stealing battle droid fingers from the battlefield and stringing them into a necklace. While attempting to derail Chopper's trustworthiness, Slick inadvertently revealed his knowledge of the Jedi's mission\u2014information he could only have obtained via the open comlink that Cody had found in the command center. When put on the spot, Slick attacked Cody and Chopper and promptly fled from the barracks, leaving his platoon charges, as well as Rex and Cody, shocked with the revelation of the sergeant's true allegiances.\n\nRex and Cody immediately gave chase to the exposed Slick, tracing a signal from his utility belt to the gunship landing platform. Instead of Slick, they found his utility belt attached to a primed thermal detonator, and they scrambled for cover just before the explosive triggered a series of others. The resulting explosion decimated the landing platform and the weapons supply depot, as well as the base's power generators. Upon learning from Gus and Chopper that Slick had been spotted running into the command center, Rex headed with Cody to apprehend the saboteur, leaving Slick's platoon and the other troops to seal the perimeter. In the command center, Rex and Cody noticed that Slick was hiding in the above ventilation shaft and engaged in a ploy to bait him out of his hiding place. While Cody secretly removed the ammunition from his DC-15S and left the weapon on the holotable console, Rex appeared to leave for the south exit to restart the base's power generators. Once the blast doors had closed behind him, he reentered the room and assisted Cody in confronting Slick, who had forsook his cover to steal Cody's empty blaster. Although held at blasterpoint, Slick refused to surrender, grabbing Rex's DC-15S and bowling him over.\n\nIn the ensuing brawl, Cody and Slick disarmed each other and engaged in unarmed combat. When Rex joined in, he received a blow to the head, and Slick knocked him to the floor and used the \"groin popper\" maneuver to dislocate his leg. Nevertheless, Cody swiftly knocked out Slick, and the enemy agent was detained and locked in handcuffs. When Skywalker and Kenobi returned, Rex and Cody presented them with Slick, who, no longer comatose, attempted to justify his actions with his hatred for the Jedi. Slick's accusations elicited rebuttals from his clone officers, who countered that his exploits had endangered the lives of the clone brothers he claimed to love. Once Slick had been ushered away to lockup, Rex and Cody reported the sabotage of the weapons depot to Skywalker and Kenobi, who replied that they had discovered the full strength of the on-world Separatist invasion force, numbering close to a thousand units.\n\nWhorm Loathsom soon launched his first assault on the Republic forces, which became based out of Crystal City. After several days of battle, the Jedi and clones were able to beat back the Separatists, forcing them into retreat for the time being. Rex took advantage of the lapse in fighting to shave his hair and review casualty reports on his datapad near the Republic's temporary forward aid station. He conferred and joked there with the medic on duty, Clone Sergeant Coric, as well as trooper Ged, who was being treated for a shoulder injury. The moment the Confederate forces initiated another attack, Rex grabbed his rifle and joined Skywalker and Kenobi in the streets. While Cody assisted Kenobi in marshaling a defense of their base, Rex took a clone platoon to accompany Skywalker along a route parallel to the city's main street.\n\nAs the clones made their way behind enemy lines, Rex recalled how the antebellum Crystal City had been glittering with beauty just days prior until the fighting crippled the city. He followed Skywalker and the rest of their men, including Coric and a patched-up Ged, to an energy sphere tower, where they divided their troops. While most of the platoon was tasked with targeting the street-level droids, Rex and Skywalker took several troopers to the roof to surprise a trio of advancing octuptarra magna tri-droids from above. Rex and his men used JT-12 jetpacks to reach the street below, while Skywalker landed on one of the tri-droids himself.\n\nRex and his comrades' combined efforts brought down the three droids, and they turned their attention to the droid infantry's exposed rear flank, pressing on without haste. Once Loathsom and his droid army had been driven into another retreat, a Republic Nu-class attack shuttle landed in Crystal City's Central Plaza. Although Kenobi believed that his new Padawan learner was on board, he and Skywalker found that instead of delivering some expected reinforcements, the shuttle had brought the young Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who had been apprenticed not to Kenobi, but to Skywalker. Rex was introduced to Tano at the base's observation post and was surprised to meet the new Padawan, as Skywalker had previously sworn never to take a Padawan. Rex could not help but chuckle when Tano nicknamed her new Master \"Skyguy,\" but Skywalker, annoyed with her hubris and arrogant behavior, told his captain to give her an \"acquaint of the position\" while taking her on his inspection rounds of Central Plaza's lookout points. Rex complied and ushered Tano away to confer with her privately.\n\nHarnessing various elements of his training, Rex helped Tano to better understand her role as a commander in the Grand Army, and they were able to reach an understanding of each other\u2014although Tano was still eager to prove that she was ready to be Skywalker's apprentice, she learned to be more appropriate and respectful to her superiors. While near the Republic's setup of AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons, Tano noticed that the Confederacy was deploying a deflector shield, a development that alarmed Rex, who knew that such a shield would render the Republic's artillery useless. Both of them joined Skywalker and Kenobi at the comm station to devise a tactic to repel the imminent Separatist counterattack.\n\nThe group decided that Skywalker would take his Padawan behind enemy lines to eliminate the shield generator, while Rex and Kenobi would engage the droids to stall for time. After Skywalker and Tano departed, Rex and Kenobi attempted to use the heavy cannons against the enemy's expanding shield but only confirmed that they were indeed useless. Using an unencrypted comlink channel to appear more convincing to the Separatists, Rex ordered the clone forces to fall back before switching back to a secure channel. Via eavesdropping on Confederate voice traffic, he learned that Loathsom had ordered his infantry to target the heavy cannons, which had impeded his troops earlier in the battle but were now ineffectual and vulnerable.\n\nAs soon as the deflector shield passed over them, Kenobi led a forward charge on Loathsom's front lines, while Rex and his men lured the droids into the buildings along the main street. When the droids fired a missile at the comm post that Rex was using as cover, the explosion winded him and knocked him to the ground. After being forced to pull back his men, he met with Kenobi at the command center. Although Rex proposed that they use the heavy cannons in spite of the shield, which would cause fatal overpressure and result in severe collateral damage, Kenobi instead ordered him to mobilize a defense of the cannons while the Jedi Master delayed the droids. Despite his reluctance to leave Kenobi to fend for himself, Rex obeyed orders and retreated while Kenobi confronted the oncoming droids. As the shield approached the heavy cannons, Rex, Coric, and their men countered the advancing droids' fire from some rubble near the main street. Rex soon learned that Kenobi had surrendered to Loathsom, but he deduced that the Jedi General was simply stalling and rallied his men to hold the line.\n\nAs Rex and his men withstood the onslaught from the droids' overwhelming numbers, Skywalker and Tano eliminated the shield generator. Rex was aiming at a Kerkoiden tank commander when he caught a glimpse of the receding shield, and he killed the enemy officer out of sheer relief at the sight. He quickly ordered the heavy cannons to commence firing on the exposed Separatists and their Armored Assault Tanks, to great effect. With Republic Admiral Wullf Yularen and Jedi Grand Master Yoda arriving with reinforcements to complete the process of securing Christophsis, Rex allowed himself to breathe and personally feel the deaths of his men, acknowledging the pain that came with losing them. Although LAAT/i gunships flew in and began to bombard the nearby droid lines, he braved the incoming fire to help Coric search through the debris for two surviving troopers whom they had located via their helmets' heads-up displays. Rex later took a gunship to pick up Skywalker and Tano from the shield generator site, then returned with them to the command base in Crystal City. During the flight back, he congratulated Skywalker and Tano on their successful mission\u2014making a point to commend the young Tano, who was slowly earning his respect.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The last meeting\n\nAfter allying herself with the Mandalorians, Tano was given a new outfit made from beskar and set to work trying to find where Maul was hiding. Tano and Kryze also developed a friendship, with Kryze becoming a combat mentor to the former Jedi. After some time, Tano and the Mandalore resistance managed to pinpoint Maul's location on Mandalore with the help of the information Tano managed to retrieve from the Pykes on Oba Diah. Knowing they did not have the numbers for a siege of Mandalore, Tano and Kryze contacted Skywalker and Kenobi, who were finishing up a battle on the planet Yerbana, for their assistance in the siege. Using the subspace frequency \"Fulcrum,\" Tano and Kryze were met by Yularen who then contacted Skywalker and Kenobi, calling them back to the ship.\n\nOnce Skywalker and Kenobi arrived, Tano greeted Skywalker and commented on how long it had been since they had last seen each other. There was a brief silence before Skywalker asked how Tano had been and where she was. Responding to Skywalker's inquiry, Tano said she was alright, but knew that they did not have time to make irrelevant conversation and needed to divulge the important information she and Kryze had immediately. After Kenobi asked what this information was, Tano explained that they had finally managed to locate Maul and that they might be able to capture him if they moved swiftly.\n\nWith this information, Skywalker and Kenobi allowed the Mandalorians onto their Star Destroyer. As Tano exited the boarding ramp, R2-D2 greeted her arrival warmly. After this, she walked towards Skywalker who said he was extremely glad to see her, but she interrupted him and told him that they would have to catch up another time as every moment they wasted there gave Maul more of an opportunity to escape, as noted by Kryze. With this, the group ventured to the strategy center to discuss the supposed siege. Arriving there, Tano explained to Kenobi and Skywalker that they had managed to pinpoint Maul's location using information she had managed to gather on Oba Diah to which Skywalker asked why she was on Oba Diah in the first place. However, Tano waved this aside by telling him that that wasn't really relevant at that present moment.\n\nAfter Kryze explained that Maul was on Mandalore, Kenobi asked what they wanted from the Republic. Kryze, embarrassed, explained that she didn't have the numbers that would be needed for a siege of this size and needed the assistance of the Republic's clones in order for a complete lockdown of Sundari. To gain this, she proposed that she would give them Maul once he was captured and that she would take the leadership role on Mandalore once the siege concluded. Nevertheless, Kenobi explained that if they aided them, it would break ancient treaties between the Republic and Mandalorians and that the two sides would once again be drawn into a war. To this, Kryze asked them what one more war was, but Skywalker explained that they didn't want another war when they were already fighting in the Clone Wars. With this, Kenobi explained that he would ask for the Jedi Council's guidance in this matter, but Kryze, desperate for help, yelled at him that there was no time to speak with them and attempted to incite Kenobi's feelings for Satine, whom Maul had murdered months prior. She scornfully looked at Kenobi as he walked away to speak with the Council, refusing to allow his feelings to control his actions. Kryze then angrily walked away as Tano watched her departure.\n\nWith Kryze gone, Skywalker quipped that that meeting had gone well with everything taken into account. Hearing Skywalker's witty remark, Tano turned back towards Skywalker and said that he and Kenobi hadn't changed much since the last time she had seen them. Skywalker then asked if that was a bad thing to which Tano smiled. He then asked her to follow him as he had a surprise for her waiting in the hangar. As they walked towards the hangar, Tano watched as the clones saluted her as she passed by, commenting that the clones shouldn't salute her anymore since she had left the Jedi Order and therefore no longer commanded them. However, Skywalker explained that they were just showing respect for the years she spent with them serving on the front lines in the Clone Wars. As they arrived, the door moved aside to reveal Rex and fellow members of the 501st's 332nd Company with their newly painted helmets bearing her markings. With her now having seen them, Skywalker motioned for her to move through the lines of troopers as they had been waiting for her.\n\nAfter seeing the troopers, Tano walked back to Skywalker and Rex who said that the paint job on the helmets was a little crude, but it was still good to see her again. Before they parted ways once more, Skywalker presented Tano with a box which contained one of her most prized former possessions. However, just as he presented her with the box, the ship's emergency alarm went off, alerting all Republic personnel aboard to get ready for battle. Kenobi rushed in, informing Skywalker and Rex to prepare all forces and that they would be entering hyperspace shortly to help ward off Grievous' surprise attack on Coruscant. Kenobi informed Skywalker that the Chancellor was under the protection of Togruta Jedi Master Shaak Ti, but that Windu had lost contact with her. Growing annoyed by their political games, Tano asked if her former masters were just going to abandon the Mandalorians. Somewhat shocked by the accusation, Kenobi urged Tano to understand that they were needed at Coruscant as this was a pivotal moment in the Clone Wars. This only annoyed Tano more as she believed that the Jedi were still playing politics, and noted that was why the people of the galaxy had lost faith in them.\n\nKenobi tried to defend himself that they were needed to defend the people of Coruscant, but Tano countered that it was about saving the Supreme Chancellor instead. When Kenobi protested that what Tano was saying wasn't fair, Tano coldly retorted that she wasn't trying to play fair. However, Skywalker offered a compromise where he would divide the 501st into a new division led by Rex who would be promoted to Commander while Tano served as an advisor. Tano accepted her new position and, with Kenobi's approval, the Siege of Mandalore could begin. Before departing, Kenobi advised Tano to capture Maul instead of trying to kill him as he hadn't seemed to stay dead in the past.\n\nTano then thanked Skywalker for the support as he once again presented her with the box, knowing she'd need its contents if she were going to face Maul. Realizing what was inside, Tano opened the box, revealing her lightsabers as she grabbed them, igniting them and revealing their new blue hue. As she looked at Skywalker, he said they were maybe a little better than when she had had them last. She then briefly practiced with them once more. Beginning to depart, Skywalker looked at Tano and said that with any luck their missions would be over soon and they would be able to reunite once more after their conclusion. She then offered Skywalker good luck as he briefly looked back at her before walking away to prepare to face Grievous. Tano then walked further into the hangar and reunited with Rex.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The Gathering\n\nTano made her third overall visit to the sacred planet Ilum when she accompanied the younglings Petro, Katooni, Zatt, Ganodi, Gungi, and Byph to the frozen world for The Gathering, where younglings found their own lightsaber crystals on the icy planet. At the Crystal Caves, the group was received by Master Yoda, who imparted wisdom on the younglings before they entered the cave. Tano returned the younglings to the Crucible to bring them back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, as the younglings interacted with Professor Huyang to begin construction of their lightsabers. However, the Crucible was attacked by Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang, who sought to steal the kyber crystals and sell them. As they are boarded, Tano led the younglings and Huyang into the ship's ventilation systems to hide. Sending Zatt and Ganodi to join R2-D2 in securing the cockpit, Tano revealed her plan to eject the pirate's boarding tube by rerouting power to the Crucible's engines. However, the younglings were discovered and had to flee the ventilation system. As the younglings set their training remotes on their attackers, Tano arrived to engage the pirates. When Tano instructed Zatt to fire the engines, she was captured by Ohnaka's pirates and taken captive, leaving the younglings alone.\n\nTano was held captive at Hondo's complex, where she was incarcerated and taunted by the pirates. Eventually, Hondo's gang was entertained by Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder, which the younglings had joined as a means to sneak in and free Tano. Katooni ended up stealing Tano's lightsabers from a drunken Ohnaka, freeing Tano and fleeing towards the Crucible. However, Ohnaka destroyed the Crucible with a WLO-5 speeder tank. The Jedi were recaptured, ignoring Tano's appeal to let the younglings go. However, the pirates arrived back at their base to find General Grievous and the Separatist army destroying it. Ohnaka and many of his pirates were captured, but freed by Tano and the younglings, who allied to drive the Separatists away. Eventually, the pirates begin to escape, with Ohnaka piloting the rebuilt Slave I. Tano convinced the younglings to run to Hondo's ship as she dueled Grievous. Holding her own with the Separatist General, the exhausted young Jedi eventually jumped over him and fled, leaping onto Slave I and escaping with the younglings and pirates to a Republic task force. As a result of all that had happened, Ahsoka considered the events surrounding her third trip to Ilum to be more of an adventure than her previous two journeys.\n\nAt some point after her mission to Carlac with Lux Bonteri, Tano had filed a report on what she learned, informing the Jedi that the alliance between the Mandalorian Death Watch and the Separatists had ended. This news prevented the Jedi Order from helping Mandalore after a crime family takeover, as it was now an internal affair. As Kenobi understood the Senate would not let them provide aid to a neutral system, he elected to go to Mandalore alone. There, he learned his old enemy, the rogue Sith Lord Maul, had been behind the takeover and was forced to watch as Duchess Satine Kryze was killed by the dark side user.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Meeting the Martez sisters\n\nA short time after leaving the Jedi and close to the end of the Clone Wars, Tano was traveling Coruscant's Industrial District aboard a Joben T-85 speeder bike she had purchased, when the craft began to malfunction. Although she ultimately managed to avoid colliding with a Gozanti-class cruiser, she was forced to crash land on the platform of a repair shop on Level 1313.\n\nThis caught the attention of the shop's mechanic, a human female named Trace Martez, who approached Tano as she pulled together the remains of her speeder. After a brief conversation, both girls introduced themselves, with Trace claiming she owned one of the best repair shops on the level. Although she offered to fix the speeder for payment, Tano noted she could not afford to pay and would fit it herself with the necessary tools. After much negotiating, Martez eventually agreed to let Ahsoka fix her bike for free. Opening the doors to her shop, Tano noticed the mechanic's Nebula-class freighter, which Martez was modifying in the hopes of one day leaving Coruscant. After she pointed Tano to a workshop, Ahsoka questioned why the mechanic was helping her, with Martez stating it felt like the right thing to do. Although she offered Tano the option to leave if she wanted, the former Jedi elected to stay.\n\nAfter Tano had begun to repair her speeder bike, Martez offered to help the former Padawan, but Tano rejected any help that would cost her. Although the mechanic was annoyed by this, noting that everything on 1313 had a price, Tano asked if she had any sparkers she could purchase. Though Martez's only sparkers were already used on her freighter and there was no available stock. Stating that was not good and noting she needed to get out, she did not answer Martez after the mechanic asked if she was running from something. Although Martez called after her, stating she could stay as long as desired as long as she could pay, Tano walked out to the platform and looked up towards the sky of Coruscant.\n\nAfterwards, Tano heard the bike working inside the shop and entered, learning that Martez had helped with it for free. She vaguely admitted to being from Coruscant's upper levels, keeping out the fact that she had been a Jedi, but defended her former order when Martez accused them of starting the Clone Wars. Martez, who felt that the Jedi had forgotten about common people like her, admitted that the Jedi were not what she had imagined based on the stories she had heard, revealing that she wanted to get away from the war and Jedi aboard her starship with her older sister, Rafa. The mechanic's opinion of the Jedi persuaded Tano to continue to keep her past a secret.\n\nTano and Martez were suddenly interrupted when a low-level gangster, Pintu Son-El, and his henchmen entered, looking for money from Rafa that she had promised him. Martez initially told Tano to stay back and tried to fight Son-El's enforcers off, she was eventually overpowered and asked Tano for help. Having been trained as a Jedi, Tano made short-work of the two enforcers, although Son-El claimed the situation was not over as he fled. Given that she had witnessed Tano's prowess, Martez asked where Tano had learned to fight, so she lied and stated it was her \"older brother.\" The two then made their way to Rafa's Laundry to tell her about Son-El, where she stated she had a job coming up that would make everything better.\n\nRafa also asked who Tano was, and, after being introduced to her, Martez recounted how Tano had fallen onto the platform. After a brief conversation between Rafa and the Twi'lek Lokann, whose \"business partner\" had arranged a deal with Rafa to build three droids. Tano and Trace worked on the three binary loadlifters, with Tano reminding the mechanic to put the restraining bolt onto the droid. After Tano activated the droid she had been working on, she and Trace began a conversation about how people acted, with Martez mentioning her belief that some people were good, others were bad, and some were cross-wired like the loadlifter she had been building. By saying this, however, Tano realized they had been building Type II loadlifter droids and, after her Type II attacked and she shut it down, explained that the \"loadlifters\" units were actually frauds, being repurposed demolition droid which could cause violence. Unfortunately for the two, Trace had yet to put a restraining bolt on her droid, allowing it to escape from the shop.",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Christophsis[]\n\nRex and his comrades' combined efforts brought down the three droids, and they turned their attention to the droid infantry's exposed rear flank, pressing on without haste. Once Loathsom and his droid army had been driven into another retreat, a Republic Nu-class attack shuttle landed in Crystal City's Central Plaza. Although Kenobi believed that his new Padawan learner was on board, he and Skywalker found that instead of delivering some expected reinforcements, the shuttle had brought the young Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who had been apprenticed not to Kenobi, but to Skywalker. Rex was introduced to Tano at the base's observation post and was surprised to meet the new Padawan, as Skywalker had previously sworn never to take a Padawan. Rex could not help but chuckle when Tano nicknamed her new Master \"Skyguy,\" but Skywalker, annoyed with her hubris and arrogant behavior, told his captain to give her an \"acquaint of the position\" while taking her on his inspection rounds of Central Plaza's lookout points. Rex complied and ushered Tano away to confer with her privately.\n\nHarnessing various elements of his training, Rex helped Tano to better understand her role as a commander in the Grand Army, and they were able to reach an understanding of each other\u2014although Tano was still eager to prove that she was ready to be Skywalker's apprentice, she learned to be more appropriate and respectful to her superiors. While near the Republic's setup of AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons, Tano noticed that the Confederacy was deploying a deflector shield, a development that alarmed Rex, who knew that such a shield would render the Republic's artillery useless. Both of them joined Skywalker and Kenobi at the comm station to devise a tactic to repel the imminent Separatist counterattack.\n\nThe group decided that Skywalker would take his Padawan behind enemy lines to eliminate the shield generator, while Rex and Kenobi would engage the droids to stall for time. After Skywalker and Tano departed, Rex and Kenobi attempted to use the heavy cannons against the enemy's expanding shield but only confirmed that they were indeed useless. Using an unencrypted comlink channel to appear more convincing to the Separatists, Rex ordered the clone forces to fall back before switching back to a secure channel. Via eavesdropping on Confederate voice traffic, he learned that Loathsom had ordered his infantry to target the heavy cannons, which had impeded his troops earlier in the battle but were now ineffectual and vulnerable.\n\nAs soon as the deflector shield passed over them, Kenobi led a forward charge on Loathsom's front lines, while Rex and his men lured the droids into the buildings along the main street. When the droids fired a missile at the comm post that Rex was using as cover, the explosion winded him and knocked him to the ground. After being forced to pull back his men, he met with Kenobi at the command center. Although Rex proposed that they use the heavy cannons in spite of the shield, which would cause fatal overpressure and result in severe collateral damage, Kenobi instead ordered him to mobilize a defense of the cannons while the Jedi Master delayed the droids. Despite his reluctance to leave Kenobi to fend for himself, Rex obeyed orders and retreated while Kenobi confronted the oncoming droids. As the shield approached the heavy cannons, Rex, Coric, and their men countered the advancing droids' fire from some rubble near the main street. Rex soon learned that Kenobi had surrendered to Loathsom, but he deduced that the Jedi General was simply stalling and rallied his men to hold the line.",

Bred and trained on the planet Kamino, he was designated CT-7567 and entered into Republic service at the Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY. He gained respect from Jedi officers and clone troopers alike as an honorable commander, becoming known as one of the best and toughest clone troopers in the Grand Army. He was even selected for special command training under Advanced Recon Commando Alpha, following which he took the name Rex. As the captain of the 501st, Rex served as second-in-command to Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, whose bravery and unorthodoxy in battle he came to share. He was close friends with Marshal Commander Cody, with their relationship mirroring that of their respective Jedi Generals, Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The four of them often received joint assignments to coordinate front-line campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nAt the Battle of Christophsis, Rex became a mentor to Skywalker's newly assigned Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, with whom he forged a strong bond. He also managed to rebound from the following Battle of Teth, an engagement he would never forget due to the near-complete eradication of his 501st unit, Torrent Company. While on a listening post inspection tour with Cody, Rex rallied a small team of rookie soldiers to retake Rishi Station, which they thereafter destroyed to thwart Confederate General Grievous's planned invasion of Kamino. He was soon deployed on tour aboard Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute, and joined Skywalker and Tano in leading 501st offensives at Bothawui, JanFathal, and other flashpoints across the galaxy. He took part in countless campaigns in the galactic theater of war, from the containment of the Blue Shadow Virus on Naboo and the liberation of Ryloth to other hard-won victories like the Battle of Malastare, the Second Battle of Geonosis, and the Battle of Kamino.\n\nThroughout his career, Rex proved to be an effective leader who truly cared for the men under his command, even as he began to doubt his own future\u2014and those of his clone brethren\u2014in the Republic. The Battle of Saleucami of 21 BBY saw him meet the clone deserter Cut Lawquane, whom he came to respect despite their striking differences. His leadership was put to the ultimate test at the Battle of Umbara, when he was forced to unite the 501st Legion under an interim Jedi General, the obstinate and aggressive Pong Krell. Rex did not see eye-to-eye with Krell and found himself having to balance his troops' well-being with Krell's high-casualty plans. When Krell manipulated the 501st into a fatal confrontation with their comrades from the 212th Attack Battalion, Rex realized their general was a traitor to the Republic, and he risked charges of treason to lead his men in arresting Krell. The ordeal refined his hard-line obedience to orders, as he also learned the value of making his own decisions as a soldier.\n\nRex's unwavering dedication to the Republic kept him on the front lines over the three-year span of the Clone Wars. He aided Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi in rescuing Togruta colonists from the Zygerrian Slave Empire and, in 20 BBY, offered his soldier's expertise to help the Jedi train local insurgents on Onderon to emancipate their world. In a stark turn of events, he and Skywalker apprehended Tano on Coruscant after she was framed for a bombing of the Jedi Temple, an incident that culminated in her departure from the Jedi Order. In addition, Rex and Skywalker gave pursuit of a longtime comrade, ARC trooper Fives, who had gone rogue after unearthing an anti-Jedi directive that had been bred into all of the Republic's clone troopers. Before Fives could prove his findings to Rex and Skywalker, the Coruscant Guard gunned him down for resisting arrest. By war's end in 19 BBY, Rex ceded his command over the 501st to another officer, Commander Appo, who oversaw the unit into the rise of the Galactic Empire.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Bombing at the Jedi Temple\n\nTowards the end of the war, Ahsoka Tano noticed that Jedi Master Yoda became less happy as the war dragged on; the Togruta observed the Jedi Master's \"deep sorrow\" and his burden of seemingly knowing that an ending neared and the ensuing instatement of a new era. At the age of 16, Ahsoka Tano's friend, Barriss Offee, who believed the Jedi Order had become evil, corrupt and overly belligerent during the war, secretly orchestrated the bombing of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In the aftermath of the incident, which killed six Jedi as well as several clones and Jedi Temple workers, Tano and Skywalker were called back from the defense of the planet Cato Neimoidia to investigate the situation along with crime scene analysis droid Russo-ISC. Before they began, Mace Windu told them that it was possible a Jedi was behind the attack. This deeply bothered both Tano and Skywalker. When Tano asked her master about the possibility, he told her that there will be Jedi who disappoint, but they will be far outnumbered by those who do the right thing.\n\nTheir investigation included interviewing witnesses and visiting the hangar where the bombing took place. Their search narrowed down the suspect list to a Temple worker named Jackar Bowmani. They traveled to his apartment and discovered that his spouse, Letta Turmond was the guilty party. She had fed Bowmani nano-droids that made him a living bomb. Their findings brushed over the possibility of a Jedi culprit. Turmond was incarcerated in a prison and guarded by Shock troopers. When Tano went to interview her, Offee used a Force choke on Turmond, which killed her and framed Tano. Offee continued her work of framing her friend and caused the deaths of several clone troopers. Clones spotted the footage of Tano seemingly killing Turmond and, Clone Commander Fox arrested Tano after he and two shock troopers entered Turmond's cell.\n\nWhile she was imprisoned despite being innocent, Tano was visited by Tarkin, who professed the Padawan guilty of Turmond's death. Later, she noticed a key card to the cell outside and used the Force to free herself. She believed that Skywalker had put it there because he had not been allowed to visit her. Knowing that she was innocent but not knowing how to convince the others of it, Tano decided to escape. However, after traveling only a short distance, she found multiple dead clone troopers and her lightsabers and comlink among the bodies. Little did she know, Offee had planted them to continue framing her. Clone Commander Fox noticed her and sounded the alarm, once again believing she had killed his men.\n\nRunning away from Republic authorities, she defended herself as clones shot stun blasts to apprehend her. Pursued by Rex, Fox, Sergeant Hound, and others, she fled into the industrial areas outside of the Republic military base. She was pursued by gunships and searchlights, and lost her shoto during the chase. Turning down into the pipes system, she temporarily hid from her pursuers until Skywalker caught up as she was preparing to jump down into the Coruscant Underworld. Skywalker told her that they could help her prove she was innocent, but Tano retorted that she was unwilling to face trial and punishment for something she did not do. Knowing that no one would believe her, Tano decided to go off on her own and jumped onto a ship that was descending into the underworld.\n\nAs Tano struggled to keep herself hidden from Coruscant underworld police and other Republic patrols searching for her, she contacted her friend Offee, who promised to help her investigate to clear her name. Tano then destroyed her comlink and acquired a cloak for disguise. She boarded a train, but when she attempted to exit before she was asked for a pass by the police, she was surrounded by police forces outside. After fighting them off and fleeing, she was attacked by her longtime nemesis Asajj Ventress, who sought the bounty on her head. However, Tano convinced Ventress to ally with her, offering a pardon from the Galactic Senate in return for her help.\n\nTano used a public holographic system to contact Offee, the only Jedi whom she still saw as an ally, unaware that she was responsible for her situation. Offee informed her of a warehouse she said was where Turmond had obtained the nano-droids. Tano convinced Ventress to come with her to the location, but she was spotted by Commander Wolffe and a group of shock troopers. Tano attempted to negotiate with them, but the clones attempted to detain her and she was forced to combat them, leaving most of the group unconscious before continuing towards the warehouse. Ventress departed at that point, reminding her to fulfill her end of the deal. Inside, Tano found the warehouse abandoned before being attacked by a figure in Ventress' bounty hunter gear. Unaware she was actually fighting her friend Offee, whom she thought was her ally, she believed the attacker was Ventress. After a short duel, Tano was knocked to the ground next to a crate of nano-droids. When she rose, she was stunned by Commander Wolffe before she could explain herself.\n\nThe Jedi Council attempted to deal with the matter internally, but were convinced by now Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin that the trial would be a Republic military trial. Despite opposition from Kenobi, the Council agreed to Tarkin's demands and expelled Tano from the Jedi Order and turned her over to the Republic for a military trial. Tano was prosecuted by Tarkin and defended by Padm\u00e9 Amidala. As the trial began, Tano remained confident her master would sort things out and prove her innocence. As Tarkin lobbied for a conviction and death sentence, Tano watched with shock as Skywalker brought an imprisoned Offee to the trial. Tano was acquitted as the captive Offee confessed to her crimes, citing that the Jedi Order was losing its way for her motive.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Entanglement with Death Watch\n\nTano accompanied Amidala to the first ever sanctioned peace conference between the Republic and Confederacy. However, the negotiations were interrupted by Junior senator Lux Bonteri, who Tano had befriended earlier in the war during Amidala and Mina Bonteri's failed peace initiative. Bonteri accused Count Dooku of being responsible for his mother's death, and Tano left the meeting to protect Bonteri from possible retribution. Sneaking aboard a Separatist landing craft, Tano intervened when Dooku ordered Bonteri's execution via hologram. Tano was intent on bringing Bonteri to Coruscant to be granted amnesty, but Bonteri had other plans. Bonteri shocked Tano with a small device, knocking her out and bringing their ship to Carlac to meet with a group Bonteri promised would help him get his revenge on Dooku.\n\nBonteri made Tano leave her lightsabers on the ship to meet with the group. Tano quickly realized that the group was Death Watch, and told Mandalorian Nite Owl Bo-Katan Kryze that she was Bonteri's betrothed to keep her identity as a Jedi a secret. When Kryze left them both alone before their meeting with Pre Vizsla, Tano learned of Bonteri's plan to convince Death Watch, who recently had a falling out with the Sith Lord, to assassinate Dooku. Tano warned Bonteri that Death Watch still had their own agenda and could not trusted, but Bonteri kissed her to interrupt her as Vizsla arrived. Vizsla forced Tano to work alongside natives that Death Watch used as slave labor. Later, when Death Watch began to pillage and burn a village, Tano attempted to fight back but was imprisoned. However, when Vizsla drew the Darksaber, intent on killing Tano, R2, who had been forced to repair Death Watch droids they used for entertainment in a fighting ring, uses a smoke screen as a diversion and slips Tano her lightsabers that he recovered from the ship. Tano acrobatically freed herself and beheaded a group of Mandalorians approaching her before dueling Vizsla. When R2 set the droids on their masters, the three escaped from Vizsla. When Bonteri piloted a speeder back to their ship, Tano defended him from Kryze and the other Mandalorians. After successfully escaping Carlac, Bonteri used an escape pod to avoid being brought to Coruscant, leaving Tano behind.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Training and Geonosis[]\n\nA Human male clone of the acclaimed bounty hunter Jango Fett, Rex was born as a clone trooper with the designation CT-7567 around the year 32 BBY on the planet Kamino for service in the Grand Army of the Republic. Granted advanced growth by the Kaminoan cloners, he was part of one of the first batches of clone troopers, and his early life largely incorporated Kaminoan flash training. As was the case with other clones who became officers, the Kaminoans spotted his natural leadership abilities early on, and over the next decade, he was put through additional command training and intensive programmed learning to develop his skills. By 22 BBY, he had begun training as a squad leader.\n\nThat same year, CT-7567 served on the planet Geonosis in the opening battle of the Clone Wars, fighting on the side of the Galactic Republic against the native Geonosians and the Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He survived the First Battle of Geonosis and continued his Grand Army service in the resultant intergalactic conflict, swearing to defend all Republic citizens from harm as part of his oath of loyalty to the Republic state. He served with Jedi Generals on multiple occasions and learned to respect their abilities; in turn, Jedi officers came to rely on him. Thanks to his aggression on the battlefield, he earned a reputation as one of the Republic Military's best and toughest clone troopers. Such was his prowess and performance that he was withdrawn from his unit and was among the 100 clone officers recalled to Kamino to undergo specialized command training.\n\nUnder the hardened eye of Advanced Recon Commando Alpha, CT-7567 and his fellow soldiers endured grueling exercises to develop independent thought, improvisation, and individuality. The ARC program led CT-7567 to befriend another officer, Marshal Commander CC-2224. After Alpha rewarded their individualism by granting them proper names, CT-7567 and CC-2224 became known as Rex and Cody, respectively, with the former keeping the origins of his nickname to himself. Rex often found himself working with Cody, particularly in a number of dangerous campaigns. One example was the Battle of Tibrin, in which they tried and failed alongside several Jedi to oust a Separatist military presence from Tibrin. Although the battle was a crushing Republic defeat, Rex and Cody managed to survive.\n\n",

Yoda then left to meet with the chancellor to decide what the best course of action was.

After battling commando droids and Droideka Sharpshooters, Kenobi headed into the governor's tower to negotiate with the Zygerrian Darts D'Nar, who was serving as the commander of the Separatist forces. Noticing her master's anger and frustration with the proposition of negotiating with a slaver, Tano soon learned that her master was a former slave, something he had never told her. When D'Nar double-crossed Kenobi and attempted to escape to his ship, Tecora, Tano and Skywalker pursued him on AT-RTs. After disabling the Tecora's engines, Tano sneaked onto the bridge and defeated D'Nar in a duel. After interrogation, they learned the natives were sold into slavery on D'Nar's homeworld of Zygerria.\n\nTano, Skywalker, Kenobi, Rex, and R2 then took the Tecora to Zygerria, with Tano posing as Skywalker's slave to meet with the Zygerrian queen, Miraj Scintel. However, when one of Scintel's slaves attempted to assassinate her before committing suicide, Skywalker decided to offer Tano as Scintel's new slave. Winning the Queen's favor, he earned himself an invite to the slave auction taking place that night. Meanwhile, Tano was put in a cage outside, but would escape to aid her master at the auction. However, they discovered Kenobi had been captured, and they failed to overcome the Zygerrians, who shipped Kenobi and Rex to a slave processing facility while Scintel imprisoned Tano and Skywalker in her palace.\n\nSkywalker was able to escape the guards with the help of R2 and then freed Tano. Skywalker learned from a dying Scintel, who was killed by the recently summoned Dooku for being unwilling to turn over Skywalker, that Kenobi and Rex were imprisoned on the planet Kadavo. Tano and Skywalker reclaimed their ship and went to free their companions. When they landed at the facility, their ship was destroyed and they were quickly pinned down. When Dooku threatened to execute the slaves if they did not stop their attack, Republic reinforcements, the 104th Battalion led by Plo Koon arrived to help. Tano and Skywalker then split up with Tano rendezvousing with the slaves and her master disabling the defense turrets. Tano located the slaves and directed Koon to fly gunships underneath the facility to help the slaves escape. After rescuing the slaves, including Kenobi and Rex, Koon's men destroyed the facility.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Escape from Oba Diah\n\nTano and the sisters were imprisoned deep within the Pyke Palace for their actions, where Tano and Rafa continued to debate what they should have done. Rafa joked that Tano's morals made her sound like a Jedi, making her question what they would do if she was a member of the Order. Though Trace told them not to jest about the subject, Rafa realized her sister had never told Tano why they avoided the Jedi and other \"Topsiders.\" Unwilling to have the secret Force-sensitive argue about morality, she recounted that, during Cad Bane's rescue of Ziro the Hutt several years earlier, the bounty hunter shot the engines of a cargo transport rising through an underworld portal to distract a team of pursuing Jedi. Trying to stop the starship from crashing into a populated landing platform, the Jedi instead steered it into the portal wall, the other side of which contained the Martez home. Their mother and father managed to get the siblings out of harm's way, but they were caught and killed in the crash.\n\nAfter failing to capture Bane, Ziro, and the other criminals, the Jedi returned, and Rafa revealed one of the Force-sensitives, Tano's old acquaintance Luminara Unduli, came over to her, telling Rafa that she had needed to make a choice about the transport. She then stated that the Force would be with them, but the religious belief meant nothing to Martez sister. The Jedi then left, leaving the two alone to find a way to survive. Rafa recounted that she had spent every day since trying to build a new life for herself and Trace, believing they had been fine until her sister let Tano come with them.\n\nTano apologized for what had happened to them, but the three young women were interrupted by the Pyke guards, who demanded Rafa come with them. While Tano stood in front of the sisters to try to protect them and Rafa offered that they instead take Tano, the Pykes pushed past the former Padawan and Trace, taking the elder sister away for interrogation. As Rafa was tortured, Trace and Tano were left in the cell, where the mechanic admitted she and her sister had been on their own until Tano arrived. Trace also revealed she had helped her because it was something her mother would have believed in. Rafa, unconscious but having refused to give up information, was then thrown into the cell by the Pyke guards. Though Tano advised her friend to not make the Pykes angry, Trace demanded they tell her what had happened to Rafa and shoved a guard, who grabbed the mechanic to take her away for interrogation.\n\nTano objected to the action, but was hit down by a guard's stun baton, making her fall to the ground. Trace called for her friend to make sure Rafa was well before being taken to the interrogation room, where she pretended to faint to distract the guards, using the opportunity to steal a CC-420 pistol and escape the room, although several guards pursued her. After noticing the Pykes run down the hallway, Tano secretly used the Force to unlock the door before waking Rafa. Informing the Martez sister that the Pykes had taken Trace and that they needed to flee, they escaped the cell, which the secret Force user claimed was opened by a power outage. As they searched for Trace, they eventually ran into the escaping mechanic, who had been heading back to the cell to break them out.\n\nReunited, the three made their way to an outside platform, and Trace blasted a barrel Tano and Rafa had knocked over to clear away the pursuing guards. Their next challenge came from a retracting bridge; although Rafa made it across in time, Tano had to use the Force to help push Trace across, and, while Rafa was willing to leave Tano behind, she was able to Force jump over the gap. While the older Martez sister recognized that it had not been a normal feat, they nevertheless needed the run from two more Pykes guards, who had arrived just before Trace made it across the bridge. The three made their way to the city gate, during which time Tano helped the sisters take out a Pyke guard in order to steal his stun baton, and she continued to debate their situation with Rafa.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Meeting the Martez sisters\n\nAfter passing Rafa on the street, Tano and Trace pursued the droid before it jumped to a lower street to rampage. As suggested by Trace, Tano ran back to Rafa's laundromat to find the unit's tracking device while she would find a speeder. Once there, Rafa questioned where the loadlifter and Trace were before Tano boarded the speeder the mechanic had found. The two located the droid and chased it, intending to grab the droid with the speeder's clamps and to use the blue off switch on the droid's face plate. After grabbing the type two, however, it began to climb, making Trace release the droid from the clamps and jump onto it herself. Although she managed to shut the unit down, the now lifeless body began to fall with Trace still holding on, forcing Tano to grab hold of it with the speeder's clamps. She quickly attached the vehicle's tow cable to nearby pipes to pull them up, but the droid and Trace proved to be too heavy. Before Trace could fall to her death, however, Tano secretly used the Force to help pull the vehicle up, with only a watching Twi'lek child realizing what she did. Relieved to see Trace safe, the two made their way back to the laundromat, where Rafa refused to take apart the loadlifters despite Tano's protests, believing them hurting anyone was not her problem.\n\nIgnoring Tano's argument by saying she was new, Rafa promised Trace that she would do the right thing. Tano and Trace made their way to the wharf, where Tano questioned if Trace had a role in making decisions with Rafa. Trace answered that Rafa was trying to make things better for them, although Tano questioned at what cost that came. Rafa then arrived to meet with them, revealing she had charged Lokann double the price, defending herself by saying they were not her property, someone else would have constructed them if they hadn't, and that it would have caused trouble for her and Trace. Although Trace was visibly disappointed, Rafa stated the credits had been used to pay off Son-El and gave money for new tools, hoping that would make it worth it. After sending a look at Tano, Rafa left the pair. Tano also started to leave to complete her speeder, and Trace thanked her for saving her life before leaving with the former Padawan.",

        "content": "# Rex - Early Clone Wars[]\n\nWithin several weeks of the First Battle of Geonosis, Rex, having become well respected by clones and Jedi officers alike, was given the rank of clone trooper captain. In addition, the Mandalorian veterans who trained clone officers on Kamino bestowed on him the battle honor of Mandalorian Jaig eyes, and he had the adornments emblazoned on his clone trooper armor's helmet. In the same year, a new elite unit was formed within the Grand Army: the 501st Legion, whose members' training surpassed even that of the lethal Advanced Recon Commandos. Rex was given command of the core group of the 501st Legion, with which he was tasked with patrolling the galaxy's lawless Outer Rim Territories. As part of his designated 501st detachment, Rex received his own troop detail\u2014Torrent Company, which became based out of the GAR clone barracks on the Republic capital world of Coruscant. He and his men were placed under the overall command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, who accepted his officer's commission after being appointed as a Jedi Knight four weeks into the war.\n\nAs Skywalker's second-in-command, Rex learned much from his commanding officer, developing a certain friendship with him. He operated with Skywalker on the front lines, with the two frequently turning unconventional tactics into Republic victories. As Skywalker later recalled, Rex, as a rookie trooper, was initially eager to follow every order to the letter but became less wound tight with the passage of time. The 501st Legion garnered fame and veteran status under their leadership, and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine took notice of how Rex and his men adopted Skywalker's unorthodox strategies with repeated success. Under Palpatine's direction, the 501st grew into an amalgamation of clone units whose members underwent secret training and were moved across the galaxy's battlefields as the war effort required. Besides his friendship with Cody, Rex formed a working relationship with Denal, a fellow 501st member, and befriended Advanced Recon Force Sergeant Boomer. He also became acquainted with Cody's own Jedi General, Obi-Wan Kenobi. On one assignment, Rex and his battalion teamed up with a squad of elite Advanced Recon Commandos to attack a battle droid army that had captured a strategic city.\n\nAt some point during his service, while equipped with a JT-12 jetpack, Rex was along a pathway and encountered an A-DSD advanced dwarf spider droid, which he fired upon from the air. Shortly after the Battle of Skye, Rex and Cody were sent to the planet to collect the remains of the genetic terrorist Zeta Magnus, who was seemingly killed by Jedi Commander Halagad Ventor. However, the being slain by Ventor was merely a clone of the real Magnus. Rex and Cody escorted the two vast halves of the fallen terrorist on separate grav-stretchers, while other clone troopers loaded the remains of Magnus' lab-instruments and cloning tanks into a Republic gunship. During the battle, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ventor were betrayed by clone commandos of Tark Squad, who turned out to be Thyrsian mercenaries working for Magnus. Upon learning that, Rex remarked that Mandalorian-trained soldiers were more trustworthy than those trained by Thyrsians. He also advised Skywalker to start wearing a helmet upon noticing a fresh scar on his face.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Bombing at the Jedi Temple\n\nTano used a public holographic system to contact Offee, the only Jedi whom she still saw as an ally, unaware that she was responsible for her situation. Offee informed her of a warehouse she said was where Turmond had obtained the nano-droids. Tano convinced Ventress to come with her to the location, but she was spotted by Commander Wolffe and a group of shock troopers. Tano attempted to negotiate with them, but the clones attempted to detain her and she was forced to combat them, leaving most of the group unconscious before continuing towards the warehouse. Ventress departed at that point, reminding her to fulfill her end of the deal. Inside, Tano found the warehouse abandoned before being attacked by a figure in Ventress' bounty hunter gear. Unaware she was actually fighting her friend Offee, whom she thought was her ally, she believed the attacker was Ventress. After a short duel, Tano was knocked to the ground next to a crate of nano-droids. When she rose, she was stunned by Commander Wolffe before she could explain herself.\n\nThe Jedi Council attempted to deal with the matter internally, but were convinced by now Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin that the trial would be a Republic military trial. Despite opposition from Kenobi, the Council agreed to Tarkin's demands and expelled Tano from the Jedi Order and turned her over to the Republic for a military trial. Tano was prosecuted by Tarkin and defended by Padm\u00e9 Amidala. As the trial began, Tano remained confident her master would sort things out and prove her innocence. As Tarkin lobbied for a conviction and death sentence, Tano watched with shock as Skywalker brought an imprisoned Offee to the trial. Tano was acquitted as the captive Offee confessed to her crimes, citing that the Jedi Order was losing its way for her motive.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Rescuing Even Piell\n\nWhile Kenobi and Piell created a diversion, Skywalker, using old archive data, led his group to one of the tunnels in order to allow them to exit the facility. As they made their way out, Tano rushed ahead to make sure the tunnel was free of droids, discovering none and notifying the group as much. With that, Tano made her way back to the rest of the group as they traversed the old tunnel. As they continued to walk across the tunnel, Skywalker asked R2 if he and his battle droids were ready to depart as Tano surveyed the tunnel. Continuing to see if any droids occupied the tunnel, Tano continued to serve as a lookout for the group as a probe droid appeared, but was subsequently cut down by Skywalker before being able to alert Sobeck of their presence. After she looked towards the lava below, Tano openly questioned a sudden comment from Tarkin, who told her that he admired the design of the fortress. To this, Tarkin noted that the ongoing incident showed that it is effective at its job, but that it was a pity that the fortress had been captured by the Separatists, which Skywalker responded to Tano's responsive stare by telling her that Tarkin had a point. However, Tano gave him a bewildered look upon him saying this. With that, Skywalker informed Tano that he would be departing the group for a short while and that he needed her to lead it for the time being which led Tano to ask were he was going to which he noted that he needed to protect their flank since Kenobi was not with them. With that, Tano looked towards Skywalker and noted that it might have been a good thing she came after all while possessing a proud look on her face.\n\nAs they continued walking, Tarkin expressed his doubt in Tano's ability to lead the group to Rex to which Rex noted that he trusted her after the many missions the two had been on together. However, as the pair's conversation continued, the group came across a dead end in the tunnel. Just then, super battle droids began to appear from their flank, forcing Tano to activate her lightsabers and defend the group. As she did this, Skywalker swooped down and cut one of the super battle droids in half and did the same to the other. However commando droids, wielding personal energy shields, soon arrived, forcing them back into action. Tano then defended herself by saying that she thought it was a dead end, which ended up being to her detriment as Skywalker informed her that if Koon had indeed assigned her to the mission, he would've briefed her on the plan. However, Tano ignored this and instead ran to the wall and began placing thermal detonators onto it. Thinking that she had placed enough, she ran back into the action with two Class-A thermal detonators that had been leftover and used them to destroy the attacking commando droids as the wall blew up behind the group. With that, Tano walked past Skywalker, smiling at him, as the group continued its journey.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The last meeting\n\nAfter seeing the troopers, Tano walked back to Skywalker and Rex who said that the paint job on the helmets was a little crude, but it was still good to see her again. Before they parted ways once more, Skywalker presented Tano with a box which contained one of her most prized former possessions. However, just as he presented her with the box, the ship's emergency alarm went off, alerting all Republic personnel aboard to get ready for battle. Kenobi rushed in, informing Skywalker and Rex to prepare all forces and that they would be entering hyperspace shortly to help ward off Grievous' surprise attack on Coruscant. Kenobi informed Skywalker that the Chancellor was under the protection of Togruta Jedi Master Shaak Ti, but that Windu had lost contact with her. Growing annoyed by their political games, Tano asked if her former masters were just going to abandon the Mandalorians. Somewhat shocked by the accusation, Kenobi urged Tano to understand that they were needed at Coruscant as this was a pivotal moment in the Clone Wars. This only annoyed Tano more as she believed that the Jedi were still playing politics, and noted that was why the people of the galaxy had lost faith in them.\n\nKenobi tried to defend himself that they were needed to defend the people of Coruscant, but Tano countered that it was about saving the Supreme Chancellor instead. When Kenobi protested that what Tano was saying wasn't fair, Tano coldly retorted that she wasn't trying to play fair. However, Skywalker offered a compromise where he would divide the 501st into a new division led by Rex who would be promoted to Commander while Tano served as an advisor. Tano accepted her new position and, with Kenobi's approval, the Siege of Mandalore could begin. Before departing, Kenobi advised Tano to capture Maul instead of trying to kill him as he hadn't seemed to stay dead in the past.\n\nTano then thanked Skywalker for the support as he once again presented her with the box, knowing she'd need its contents if she were going to face Maul. Realizing what was inside, Tano opened the box, revealing her lightsabers as she grabbed them, igniting them and revealing their new blue hue. As she looked at Skywalker, he said they were maybe a little better than when she had had them last. She then briefly practiced with them once more. Beginning to depart, Skywalker looked at Tano and said that with any luck their missions would be over soon and they would be able to reunite once more after their conclusion. She then offered Skywalker good luck as he briefly looked back at her before walking away to prepare to face Grievous. Tano then walked further into the hangar and reunited with Rex.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Escape from Oba Diah\n\nWhen both of them were working on Trace's freighter in the repair shop, Tano continued to hide her past from the Martez sister by claiming she had gone to \"Skywalker Academy.\" Although the mechanic had never heard of the fake school, she believed it was real, having never truly heard of any academy. When Tano asked why she would never have attended one of the schools, the mechanic noted that there were none where they lived, and that she would not be able to afford it. Trace then stated Rafa and her inherited the hangar the repair shop was in, claiming their parents had \"split,\" and that Rafa had won her store gambling. However, Trace had built her freighter herself, telling Tano its name was the Silver Angel. Although Tano chuckled at the name, she told Trace she could call her starship whatever name she desired, and secret Force-sensitive returned to work on her speeder bike, which Trace had dubbed \"Trash.\" After talking about where she would go once the speeder was fixed, Tano accepted Trace's suggestion to stay a for short time longer, as long as Rafa did not mind. At that moment Rafa entered the shop and was told that Tano would be staying. After asking what skills the former Padawan had, Tano stated she only had useful ones.\n\nRafa entered to tell her sister that a crew and starship she had hired had backed out of a job. Although Trace was annoyed her sibling had hired a pilot other than herself, Rafa now needed her sister and her freighter. Although Tano asked what the job was, Rafa refused to answer her until they had left, and Trace accepted the task. Rafa reminded her sister that they could not rely on anyone's help, seeing that Trace was beginning to trust Tano. After her sister had entered the Silver Angel, though, Rafa confronted Tano and asked what she was looking for. The former Padawan stated she did not have, as Rafa put it, an \"angle,\" unless maybe to keep the two siblings out of trouble. Rafa and her then entered the ship, but not without the older sibling implying Tano could be the trouble Trace needed to avoid. Now with all three inside the cockpit, the Silver Angel took off from the underworld portal, but Trace flew the ship into a restricted military lane. The Angel was soon hailed by a Star Destroyer that had both Skywalker and Yularen, the same admiral Tano had served with, aboard. While the admiral was willing to send a detachment aboard to arrest the Angel's crew, Skywalker and Tano sensed each other, so the Jedi Knight elected to let her and the Silver Angel continue on their way.\n\nNow in open space, Tano noted that Rafa had yet to tell her and Trace where they were going. In response, Rafa only told her sister about their destination before they jumped to lightspeed. During their journey, however, Trace had forgotten to disengage the air brakes, making the Angel rumble, and Trace noted she had never been to hyperspace. Tano then learned that her friend had only ever piloted smaller vehicles meant for use on planets, allowing Rafa to quietly explain why she had wanted a different pilot. Once Tano pointed out the rumbling, Trace remembered to disable the air brakes, and the three finally arrived at the Akkadese Maelstrom, a massive cluster of debris and gas that surrounded their destination, the Outer Rim world of Kessel. Realizing they were heading to a planet infamous for its corruption, Tano asked Rafa what their job was. Rafa stated they were picking up medicine and tried to calm the former Padawan's worries when they reached the lush section of the planet. The three young women arrived at King Yaruba's palace, where they were greeted by his majordomo, Kinash Lock. Tano and the sisters were brought to a banquet, but, after learning the medicine was three containers of unrefined spice, the Force-sensitive noted that the substance could be used in illegal products. Lock denied her allegation, claiming their spice was used for medicine during the current time of war and that the Yaruba Family had always supported spreading health and joy.",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Christophsis[]\n\nSeven weeks into the war, Rex and Cody were dispatched with a Republic battle group under the command of Skywalker and Kenobi to liberate the planet Christophsis, which had fallen to the Confederacy and its Retail Caucus conglomerate. En route to Christophsis aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, Rex witnessed a holographic broadcast alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody in which General Whorm Loathsom, the leader of the enemy invasion, pressured the Christophsian populace into submitting to Separatist rule. After reaching the Christoph system, the Republic forces defeated Confederate Admiral Trench's naval blockade and established a base on the surface.\n\nSkywalker and Kenobi then took a clone contingent led by Rex and Cody into the capital, Chaleydonia, more commonly known as Crystal City. Once there, the Jedi and clones prepared an ambush to offset the Confederacy's advantage in troop strength. They moved into a business complex with two north- and south-facing towers, from which they intended to intercept a Separatist droid battalion set to pass through the major plaza below. Rex and Skywalker stationed their men in the north tower's forty-sixth level, while that of the south tower housed the detail led by Kenobi, Cody, and Clone Sergeant Slick.\n\nAs the Separatist battalion commanded by the T-series tactical droid TJ-55 marched through the business complex's plaza, the troop column unexpectedly split in half. The Republic's strategy was thus compromised when numerous B1-Series battle droid squads ambushed Kenobi's men in the south tower. After signaling clone trooper pilot Hawk for an evacuation, Skywalker, Rex, and their men used their DC-15A blaster rifles' ascension cables to rappel over to the south tower. They avoided laser fire from the droid infantry below and arrived to reinforce Kenobi and Cody, who were holding out against overwhelming numbers. Once Kenobi temporarily impeded the droids' advance by Force-pushing a blaster cannon at them, the combined clone detachment took a turbolift to the roof for their evacuation. TJ-55 pursued them to the roof with more droid troops, and Rex, Cody, and the clones provided cover fire for Skywalker and Kenobi to cut through the droids. Hawk's LAAT/i gunship soon arrived, and Rex and his comrades escaped with TJ-55's cranial unit, which trooper Gus had pilfered.\n\nBack at the base that night, Rex and Cody analyzed TJ-55's cranial unit in the command center under a robolobotomy, but they only confirmed that the Confederacy had been aware of their plan before the unit stopped processing. Upon being apprised of their clone officers' findings, Skywalker suggested that a security breach was the cause for the Separatists' acquisition of their strategy, but Kenobi went so far as to suspect that there was a spy among their men. Skywalker and Kenobi decided to investigate behind enemy lines, ordering Rex and Cody to keep their mission confidential and remain behind to apprehend the potential traitor.\n\nShortly after the Jedi departed, Cody was alarmed to find a Hush-98 comlink deliberately left activated on a nearby table with the troops' other equipment, indicating that someone had remotely eavesdropped on their conversation with the Jedi. Rex then noticed a figure in the hallway too far away to be identified: Sergeant Slick, who had become a spy for the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress and the Confederacy out of a grudge against the Jedi. Slick immediately broke into a run and ignored Rex's commands to halt, forcing Rex and Cody to pursue him through the base. Despite losing their target, the two officers were able to follow his path through the complex's hallways to the clones' mess hall, where they realized that the traitor was one of their own brethren.\n\nReturning to the command center, Rex and Cody attempted to contact Skywalker and Kenobi but found that communications were being blocked, potentially by the spy in their camp. Rex resolved to use Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, to check the station's outgoing transmission logs from the past few days. Musing through R2-D2's findings with a datapad, Rex traced an odd spike in wavelength interference to a computer terminal located in the barracks of Slick's unit. Inferring that one of Slick's men was the spy, Rex and Cody decided to individually interrogate the platoon's members despite protest from Slick.",

The officers commanded at Forward Command Centers and positions of great visual range. A handful of captains used speeder bikes to destroy the huge and clumsy Confederacy OG-9 homing spider droids, throwing pulse grenades as they raced across the battlefield. Also, a branch of jet trooper captains participated in many prominent battles, such as Mace Windu's defense of Dantooine. Some time after first battle on Geonosis, clones began customizing their armor in various color schemes and patters. This carried on into the use of Phase II armor. One notable clone captain was Rex, who fought on the front lines with the grit of an Advanced Recon Commando. He participated in many campaigns throughout the war and was initially the senior clone officer of the elite 501st Legion until clone trooper sergeant Appo was promoted and became a clone trooper commander, taking over Rex's duties as the legion's commanding officer.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Leaving her old life behind\n\nFollowing her trial, Tano was personally pardoned by the Jedi Council. Plo Koon apologized to her on the Council's behalf, stating they had been wrong to question her loyalty. The Council also stated that the Force worked in mysterious ways and therefore considered Tano's ordeal in hindsight as being her great trial, making her a greater Jedi and proving herself worthy of the title of Jedi Knight. However, the events surrounding her expulsion and trial had severely shaken Tano's faith in the Jedi. To the surprise of everyone involved, she refused to accept the Jedi Council and Skywalker's invitation to rejoin the Order. Tano instead left to discover a new purpose for herself.\n\nSkywalker chased after her, and, while Kenobi moved as well, Koon held the Jedi Master back. Having caught up with Tano, Skywalker asked her why she wanted to leave and begged her to stay. Tano explained that she felt that as the Council lost faith in her, she could no longer find the confidence to trust in herself. Skywalker reminded her that he had believed in and fought to prove her innocence, and although Tano accepted this, the situation was not about him. She felt she could not stay anymore and needed to find her own path away from the Jedi Order. Skywalker then told her that he understood the feeling of wanting to leave the Jedi, but Tano simply responded that she knew, and as Skywalker looked at her, his former Padawan turned her back and walked away from the Jedi Order.\n\nTano's departure from the Jedi Order had a deep impact on those she knew. During a quest to discover the secrets of immortality, Yoda was faced with visions of the Great Jedi Purge. In one such vision, he saw Tano dying in the halls of the Jedi Temple, with the vision of her asking if she could become one with the Force after being expelled from the Jedi Order. The vision of Tano was a result of Yoda's guilt over having placed her on the path that led to her departure from the Order.\n\nTano's former mentor Skywalker was particularly affected by her departure and felt even more alone in having to fulfill the expectations of being the prophesied Chosen One. Her departure also intensified Skywalker's frustration with the Council, as he felt they had betrayed her and left her with no choice by turning their backs on her during her trial. Following her departure, Skywalker continued to lament his Padawan's decision, and wondered if Amidala had the same thought. During Skywalker and Amidala's mission on the planet Mokivj, the Senator cited Tano's maneuver in the Battle of Ryloth, the Marg Sabl, to the Chiss Commander Thrawn, and explained the origins of the name to him.\n\nWhen Skywalker and Kenobi undertook a mission to Utapau, where they discovered a secret arms deal between the Confederacy and Sugi weapons dealers, Skywalker briefly forgot Tano had left the Jedi and suggested contacting her, but he cut himself off after remembering her absence and tried to avoid the subject. Kenobi questioned if he wanted to discuss what had happened, and, after they had set up camp, Skywalker admitted he missed Tano and still could not understand how she left. Skywalker still felt that she was a Jedi and belonged with them. Kenobi disagreed with Skywalker's opinion, asserting that it had been Tano's decision to leave, but Skywalker believed that the Jedi Council had abandoned Tano, and therefore left her with no alternative to leaving the Order. Kenobi also felt mistakes had been made, but he still noted that leaving had been her choice and recalled that Tano had allowed her emotions to influence her judgment, which was not the Jedi way. When Kenobi told Skywalker to not take responsibility for her decision, the Jedi Knight asked how his former master would feel if he became a major disappointment, to which Kenobi admitted he would not feel very well about it.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Meeting the Martez sisters\n\nA short time after leaving the Jedi and close to the end of the Clone Wars, Tano was traveling Coruscant's Industrial District aboard a Joben T-85 speeder bike she had purchased, when the craft began to malfunction. Although she ultimately managed to avoid colliding with a Gozanti-class cruiser, she was forced to crash land on the platform of a repair shop on Level 1313.\n\nThis caught the attention of the shop's mechanic, a human female named Trace Martez, who approached Tano as she pulled together the remains of her speeder. After a brief conversation, both girls introduced themselves, with Trace claiming she owned one of the best repair shops on the level. Although she offered to fix the speeder for payment, Tano noted she could not afford to pay and would fit it herself with the necessary tools. After much negotiating, Martez eventually agreed to let Ahsoka fix her bike for free. Opening the doors to her shop, Tano noticed the mechanic's Nebula-class freighter, which Martez was modifying in the hopes of one day leaving Coruscant. After she pointed Tano to a workshop, Ahsoka questioned why the mechanic was helping her, with Martez stating it felt like the right thing to do. Although she offered Tano the option to leave if she wanted, the former Jedi elected to stay.\n\nAfter Tano had begun to repair her speeder bike, Martez offered to help the former Padawan, but Tano rejected any help that would cost her. Although the mechanic was annoyed by this, noting that everything on 1313 had a price, Tano asked if she had any sparkers she could purchase. Though Martez's only sparkers were already used on her freighter and there was no available stock. Stating that was not good and noting she needed to get out, she did not answer Martez after the mechanic asked if she was running from something. Although Martez called after her, stating she could stay as long as desired as long as she could pay, Tano walked out to the platform and looked up towards the sky of Coruscant.\n\nAfterwards, Tano heard the bike working inside the shop and entered, learning that Martez had helped with it for free. She vaguely admitted to being from Coruscant's upper levels, keeping out the fact that she had been a Jedi, but defended her former order when Martez accused them of starting the Clone Wars. Martez, who felt that the Jedi had forgotten about common people like her, admitted that the Jedi were not what she had imagined based on the stories she had heard, revealing that she wanted to get away from the war and Jedi aboard her starship with her older sister, Rafa. The mechanic's opinion of the Jedi persuaded Tano to continue to keep her past a secret.\n\nTano and Martez were suddenly interrupted when a low-level gangster, Pintu Son-El, and his henchmen entered, looking for money from Rafa that she had promised him. Martez initially told Tano to stay back and tried to fight Son-El's enforcers off, she was eventually overpowered and asked Tano for help. Having been trained as a Jedi, Tano made short-work of the two enforcers, although Son-El claimed the situation was not over as he fled. Given that she had witnessed Tano's prowess, Martez asked where Tano had learned to fight, so she lied and stated it was her \"older brother.\" The two then made their way to Rafa's Laundry to tell her about Son-El, where she stated she had a job coming up that would make everything better.\n\nRafa also asked who Tano was, and, after being introduced to her, Martez recounted how Tano had fallen onto the platform. After a brief conversation between Rafa and the Twi'lek Lokann, whose \"business partner\" had arranged a deal with Rafa to build three droids. Tano and Trace worked on the three binary loadlifters, with Tano reminding the mechanic to put the restraining bolt onto the droid. After Tano activated the droid she had been working on, she and Trace began a conversation about how people acted, with Martez mentioning her belief that some people were good, others were bad, and some were cross-wired like the loadlifter she had been building. By saying this, however, Tano realized they had been building Type II loadlifter droids and, after her Type II attacked and she shut it down, explained that the \"loadlifters\" units were actually frauds, being repurposed demolition droid which could cause violence. Unfortunately for the two, Trace had yet to put a restraining bolt on her droid, allowing it to escape from the shop.\n\nAfter passing Rafa on the street, Tano and Trace pursued the droid before it jumped to a lower street to rampage. As suggested by Trace, Tano ran back to Rafa's laundromat to find the unit's tracking device while she would find a speeder. Once there, Rafa questioned where the loadlifter and Trace were before Tano boarded the speeder the mechanic had found. The two located the droid and chased it, intending to grab the droid with the speeder's clamps and to use the blue off switch on the droid's face plate. After grabbing the type two, however, it began to climb, making Trace release the droid from the clamps and jump onto it herself. Although she managed to shut the unit down, the now lifeless body began to fall with Trace still holding on, forcing Tano to grab hold of it with the speeder's clamps. She quickly attached the vehicle's tow cable to nearby pipes to pull them up, but the droid and Trace proved to be too heavy. Before Trace could fall to her death, however, Tano secretly used the Force to help pull the vehicle up, with only a watching Twi'lek child realizing what she did. Relieved to see Trace safe, the two made their way back to the laundromat, where Rafa refused to take apart the loadlifters despite Tano's protests, believing them hurting anyone was not her problem.\n\nIgnoring Tano's argument by saying she was new, Rafa promised Trace that she would do the right thing. Tano and Trace made their way to the wharf, where Tano questioned if Trace had a role in making decisions with Rafa. Trace answered that Rafa was trying to make things better for them, although Tano questioned at what cost that came. Rafa then arrived to meet with them, revealing she had charged Lokann double the price, defending herself by saying they were not her property, someone else would have constructed them if they hadn't, and that it would have caused trouble for her and Trace. Although Trace was visibly disappointed, Rafa stated the credits had been used to pay off Son-El and gave money for new tools, hoping that would make it worth it. After sending a look at Tano, Rafa left the pair. Tano also started to leave to complete her speeder, and Trace thanked her for saving her life before leaving with the former Padawan.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Rescuing Even Piell\n\nArriving at the pipeline, Tano rushed ahead to gain a better perspective on it as Skywalker explained where the pipeline led and the plan for their escape. He then opened the hatch as the group had to shield their noses from the noxious fumes coming out of the pipeline. Tano then ventured into the pipeline, being the first to enter. As the group made it up the pipeline, Tano climbed from the outside and used her acrobatic skills to maneuver around and make it to the top of the pipeline. Cautiously skimming across it, Tano eventually stopped and informed the group that she thought she found a way out. Opening the hatch, she notified the group that there were no droids present as well as informing them that R2 had not yet arrived with the shuttle. As she attempted to climb out of the hatch, however, two battle droids pointed their blasters at her, but she easily managed to destroy them using her lightsabers, but soon discovered many more battle droids as well as crab droids advancing on their position. Even so, the group made their way out of the pipeline and towards the advancing droids. As Tarkin and the clones exited the pipeline, Tano and Skywalker defended them, deflecting as many of the droids' blaster bolts as was possible using their lightsabers. However, the group was soon forced to escape as they became overwhelmed by the number of droids. As Tano took cover along with the rest of the group, Skywalker took a thermal detonator and threw it at the hatch, closing it and destroying the entire pipeline along with the droids. With that, Skywalker informed them that they would now be following plan B, which was to meet up with the shuttle where Kenobi was supposed to be located.\n\nAs Skywalker's group arrived at the landing platform, they discovered Kenobi's group pinned down by several turrets surrounding the shuttle. In response to this, Skywalker's group was forced to take cover alongside Kenobi's group. While pinned down, Tano noted that the ship was surrounded to which Tarkin offered a solution in the way of a full-scale assault on the droids. However, Kenobi noted that if they did that the turrets would simply destroy the ship and their only chance of escape, but Tarkin offered up a counter solution where they take over the turrets and decimate the droids surrounding the shuttle. As they continued their conversation, Skywalker pointed out the STAPs headed for them as they began to fire upon them, destroying the crates behind them and forcing the four Jedi to ignite their lightsabers.\n\nThe Jedi managed to use this to their advantage, however, as Skywalker managed to grab hold of one of the STAPs in an attempt to destroy the turrets. However, more droid reinforcements continued to arrive alongside several commando droids, one of which climbed into one of the turrets and attempted to destroy the shuttle. Seeing this, ARC trooper CT-1409 \"Echo\" ran out into the open in an attempt to claim the shuttle, but the shuttle was instead destroyed and Echo was thought dead; however, the debris from the destruction of the shuttle managed to destroy the turret the commando droid was manning. With the shuttle now destroyed, the now once again combined group was forced to make a tactical retreat.\n\nAs the group escaped, Kenobi and Skywalker contacted the Jedi on Coruscant and informed them that they were going to need a rescue since their shuttle had been destroyed. Finally finding cover, Tano conversed with one of the rescued officers as Kenobi, Piell, and Skywalker discussed how they were going to make it to the rendezvous point and decided that they would just have to keep moving. With that, the group moved out, making their way towards the rendezvous point, believing that they still had a chance to escape.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Escape from Oba Diah\n\nUnderstanding that the syndicate's reputation was at stake, the former Padawan recognized that the Pykes had no desire to let them escape, so Rafa had Tano head to disable the gate while she and Trace went to distract the guards. The Martez sister claimed to give Tano the job because of her resourcefulness, though the former Padawan also believed it was because Rafa thought it was more difficult. As her friend left for the control tower, Trace speculated that her sister and Tano were getting along better, but Rafa denied that. Tano was able to sneak into the control tower and managed to dispatch the control room's guards in physical combat, but she quickly saw that the Martez sisters had gotten into a firefight with the Pykes outside. After opening the gates and traveling down, she secretly used the Force to pull the two guards into the open, giving Trace the chance to shoot both of them. Tano then called the sisters forward, and the three young women escaped into the city.\n\nAfter Trace, believing she saw the Silver Angel, excitedly ran past the two of them, Tano and Rafa were given the chance to talk in private about whether Trace should be involved in criminal jobs. Rafa changed the topic to question Tano about why she was interested in helping, although they were soon interrupted by a begging Gotal. Rafa claimed to have no credits, and she and Tano left him so they could catch up to Trace. Once they had, Rafa again asked what she wanted, so Tano informed the Martez sister that she made it her duty to help those in need, a trait that Rafa admitted sounded like her mother. She confided in Tano that she was simply trying to do what was best for her sister and herself. Trace then informed her friend and sister that she had in fact found the Angel, but the trio was spotted by the Pykes, who had been helped in their search by the angered Gotal beggar, after Trace and Rafa had argued about whether to use the Angel to escape. The three ran through the crowded street while pursued and under blaster fire, unknowingly attracting the attention of a hooded Mandalorian Nite Owl, who was on planet for a mission with Bo-Katan Kryze, the very Death Watch lieutenant Tano had fought during the battle on Carlac earlier in the war.\n\nWhile trying to escape the Pyke guards by riding on a civilian's landspeeder, one of the syndicate soldiers blasted out one of the craft's engines, throwing Rafa and Trace off the vehicle while pushing Tano further away from the Pykes. As the sisters were captured, Tano continued to escape through the city, unknowingly being watched by Kryze, who was unsure if the Force-sensitive was in fact Tano, Ursa Wren, and a third Mandalorian Nite Owl. Although Wren feared her presence could compromise their mission on Oba Diah, Kryze also recognized that they shared an enemy in the rogue Sith Lord Maul, who still had control over Mandalore. Thus, Kryze decided they would keep track of the former Padawan's movements.\n\nElsewhere, Tano watched over Rafa and Trace from a building-top, learning that Krim and Fife intended to kill the two sisters before torturing her to learn where the spice was. After discretely taking out a guard, the former Padawan took control of a construction vehicle, interrupting the planned execution by ramming the repulsorcraft into the Pykes and using its frontal cannons. Although she cleared away most of the Pyke guards in their path, Fife\u2014who had purposely drawn Tano into a trap with the execution\u2014returned with a cannon-equipped landspeeder. The cannon downed Tano's replusorcraft, preventing their escape and allowing them to be subsequently surrounded by Pyke guards.\n\nTano and the sisters were escorted back to their cell, with one of the guards shoving the secret Force-sensitive into the confinement. Rafa tried to arrange a deal, but Krim denied the three the chance at another job and stated his intention to torture them until he learned where the spice was. Once all but one of the guards left, Rafa apologized for taking the job, so Tano told the young woman that she would learn from the experience. Nevertheless, Trace asked her sister and friend how much longer they would be alive to learn those lessons.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Captured at Felucia\n\nTano would travel with Skywalker, Koon, and their respective troops to another engagement on Felucia. In a pincer movement, Tano took Clone Corporal \"Comet\" and several other troopers around the wall of a Separatist facility. As the clones scaled the wall with grappling hooks, Tano guarded the rear. However, when she tried to follow the troopers up the wall, she was captured in a stun net by the Trandoshan Lo-Taren. He placed her in a cage on a prisoner ship. Tano and multiple other prisoners were dropped on Island Four on the jungle moon Wasskah, where members of a Trandoshan hunting guild would hunt them for sport. Tano survived the night and met up with a trio of former Jedi younglings, Kalifa, Jinx, and O-Mer. She joined their small band that worked hard to survive but had already lost hope of any kind of escape. Tano tried to convince them that they should be more proactive in their attempts to make it off of the moon, but Kalifa told her that there had been Padawans like her in the past that got themselves killed. Glumly, Tano settled in on the group's routine of staying on the move during the day and returning to a hiding place to rest at night.\n\nHowever, Tano's constant energy and belief began to convince the other Jedi to have hope of eventual escape or rescue. As they worked to discover where the Trandoshan's base was, O-Mer noticed their Ubrikkian Floating Fortress in the air. The group was immediately attacked by several hunters, forcing them to split up. Tano broke off from the group with Kalifa and defended her after she was wounded by Dar. Using her more advanced abilities, she fended off Dar and eventually sent him plummeting to his death. Unfortunately, as she helped Kalifa rise to her feet, she was shot by Dar's father, Garnac, who was also the leader of the hunters. Howling in anger, Garnac continued to fire at Tano as Kalifa slumped against a tree, mortally wounded. Tano promised to look after the others and stayed with her until she breathed her last.\n\nReturning to their hiding place, Tano revealed to the others that Kalifa had been killed. Jinx and O-Mer plunged into despair, but Tano did her best to keep their spirits up, proposing a plan to attack a transport ship as it delivered new prisoners. That night, they assaulted a ship, but were unable to gain control of the ship as it crashed onto the beach. However, they gained a new companion in the Wookiee Chewbacca. Being the only one to understand Shyriiwook, Tano translated Chewbacca's ideas to the group, including his plan to build a transmitter from the wreckage of the ship to contact his people on the nearby Kashyyyk.\n\nThe next night, the four companions ventured back to the wreckage, with Jinx and O-Mer covering Tano and Chewbacca as they crawled through the remains of the ship. Tano helped Chewbacca find parts, and when they emerged from the ship, they were fired on by a sniper. Jinx and O-Mer incapacitated him and the group eventually took the Trandoshan prisoner. In the morning, Jinx used a mind trick to get the hunter to summon a pickup. Then, taking control of the hover pod, they used it to fly up to the Trandoshan base. The group entered hand-to-hand combat with the other hunters and eventually received support from the Wookiee chieftain Tarfful, who had gotten a message from Chewbacca's transmitter. Arriving in the assault gunship Halo, Tarfful and his warriors helped them defeat the hunters. Tano then entered the main hall of their base to confront Garnac and eventually pushed him off of the balcony, killing him.\n\nReturning to the Jedi Temple, Skywalker was relieved to see his Padawan. He profusely apologized for leaving her behind, but Tano instead gave her master her thanks, saying that without his training, she would not have made it back or helped the others survive. The two walked back towards the temple, with Master Yoda looking on and smiling.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Training Onderon's Rebels\n\nTano, along with Masters Skywalker, Kenobi, and Captain Rex was ordered by the Jedi Council to train and assist the rebels of Onderon in their fight against the newly installed King Sanjay Rash and his Confederate occupation forces. There, she met up with rebels' leaders, Steela Gerrera, her brother Saw, and former junior senator Lux Bonteri. Tano, her fellow Jedi, and Rex were successful in teaching the rebels how to fight the battle droids.\n\nAfter infiltrating Iziz, Tano was left behind to continue acting as liaison between the Rebels and the Jedi while Skywalker, Kenobi, and Rex returned to Republic lines. Even as the Rebels had continued success, public opinion did not think very highly of them. Hoping to change public opinion, the Rebels, Tano, Bonteri and the Gerreras destroyed the power generator to disrupt the battle droid patrols throughout Iziz, and after their victory, Steela was given the title of leader of the Rebels. However, the Separatist response to the growing resistance was swift. Dooku sent General Kalani to reinforce their grip on the planet and ordered the former King, Ramsis Dendup, to be executed. Saw went in to attempt to save the King himself, was captured. Tano then assisted Steela in planning a breakout of the two during the public execution. They rescued King Dendup and Saw and fled the city. However, she exposed the Jedi's presence when she had to use the Force during the rescue.\n\nTano and the rebels regrouped in their base, which was located in the highlands outside of Iziz and awaited a Separatist response. They were soon assaulted by Kalani's forces, including the new HMP droid gunship, which inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels' side and could not be touched by the weaponry at their disposal. Tano decided to call in a favor from Skywalker, who made a deal with Hondo Ohnaka to get several rocket launchers delivered to the rebels. Ohnaka made the delivery himself, and the new weapons turned the tide of the battle. As the Rebels turned their new weaponry on the last of the gunships, Tano and Bonteri rushed to save the King from a force of commando droids. While they saved the King, a gunship shot down by Saw careened into their location, causing Steela to almost fall off of the cliff. As she hung on, Bonteri rushed to save her, but fell over himself. Tano used the Force to save Bonteri, but while she did the same for Steela, the gunship fired on her, wounding her and causing her to drop Steela to her death. In the aftermath of the battle, Tano was shaken from her role in Steela's death despite their victory. Saw was also bitter and at his sister's funeral, rejecting Tano's attempt to apologize for her failure.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Christophsis[]\n\nThough troopers Jester, Punch, Sketch, and Gus all passed interrogation with credible alibis, trooper Chopper was forced to reveal that he had broken war protocols by stealing battle droid fingers from the battlefield and stringing them into a necklace. While attempting to derail Chopper's trustworthiness, Slick inadvertently revealed his knowledge of the Jedi's mission\u2014information he could only have obtained via the open comlink that Cody had found in the command center. When put on the spot, Slick attacked Cody and Chopper and promptly fled from the barracks, leaving his platoon charges, as well as Rex and Cody, shocked with the revelation of the sergeant's true allegiances.\n\nRex and Cody immediately gave chase to the exposed Slick, tracing a signal from his utility belt to the gunship landing platform. Instead of Slick, they found his utility belt attached to a primed thermal detonator, and they scrambled for cover just before the explosive triggered a series of others. The resulting explosion decimated the landing platform and the weapons supply depot, as well as the base's power generators. Upon learning from Gus and Chopper that Slick had been spotted running into the command center, Rex headed with Cody to apprehend the saboteur, leaving Slick's platoon and the other troops to seal the perimeter. In the command center, Rex and Cody noticed that Slick was hiding in the above ventilation shaft and engaged in a ploy to bait him out of his hiding place. While Cody secretly removed the ammunition from his DC-15S and left the weapon on the holotable console, Rex appeared to leave for the south exit to restart the base's power generators. Once the blast doors had closed behind him, he reentered the room and assisted Cody in confronting Slick, who had forsook his cover to steal Cody's empty blaster. Although held at blasterpoint, Slick refused to surrender, grabbing Rex's DC-15S and bowling him over.\n\nIn the ensuing brawl, Cody and Slick disarmed each other and engaged in unarmed combat. When Rex joined in, he received a blow to the head, and Slick knocked him to the floor and used the \"groin popper\" maneuver to dislocate his leg. Nevertheless, Cody swiftly knocked out Slick, and the enemy agent was detained and locked in handcuffs. When Skywalker and Kenobi returned, Rex and Cody presented them with Slick, who, no longer comatose, attempted to justify his actions with his hatred for the Jedi. Slick's accusations elicited rebuttals from his clone officers, who countered that his exploits had endangered the lives of the clone brothers he claimed to love. Once Slick had been ushered away to lockup, Rex and Cody reported the sabotage of the weapons depot to Skywalker and Kenobi, who replied that they had discovered the full strength of the on-world Separatist invasion force, numbering close to a thousand units.\n\nWhorm Loathsom soon launched his first assault on the Republic forces, which became based out of Crystal City. After several days of battle, the Jedi and clones were able to beat back the Separatists, forcing them into retreat for the time being. Rex took advantage of the lapse in fighting to shave his hair and review casualty reports on his datapad near the Republic's temporary forward aid station. He conferred and joked there with the medic on duty, Clone Sergeant Coric, as well as trooper Ged, who was being treated for a shoulder injury. The moment the Confederate forces initiated another attack, Rex grabbed his rifle and joined Skywalker and Kenobi in the streets. While Cody assisted Kenobi in marshaling a defense of their base, Rex took a clone platoon to accompany Skywalker along a route parallel to the city's main street.\n\nAs the clones made their way behind enemy lines, Rex recalled how the antebellum Crystal City had been glittering with beauty just days prior until the fighting crippled the city. He followed Skywalker and the rest of their men, including Coric and a patched-up Ged, to an energy sphere tower, where they divided their troops. While most of the platoon was tasked with targeting the street-level droids, Rex and Skywalker took several troopers to the roof to surprise a trio of advancing octuptarra magna tri-droids from above. Rex and his men used JT-12 jetpacks to reach the street below, while Skywalker landed on one of the tri-droids himself.",

While defending against them, Tano used both of her lightsabers in order to defend against her crab droid while Piell easily managed to destroy his. Tano soon managed to destroy one of the other crab droids that had arrived while the two were overlooked by one of the anoobas. It quickly sprung into action and tackled Piell, forcing Tano to attempt to save him. Tano was too late, however, as, after using the Force to push the anooba away, Piell laid dying on the ground. As Tano reattached her lightsabers to her belt, she checked for Piell's vitals and exclaimed that she needed to get help, but was stopped by Piell who told her that he needed to tell her his half of the Nexus Route coordinates. Tano attempted to tell him that she should go get Skywalker or Kenobi, but Piell insisted that she hear them instead. To this, Tano admitted that she hadn't truly been assigned to the mission, but Piell did not care, informing her that now she was one of the most important pieces of the mission whether she was meant to be here or not and that she give his half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route only to the Jedi Council. With that, Piell gave Tano his half of the coordinates.\n\nAs the rest of the group finished off the remaining droids, Tano arrived carrying the dead body of Piell. As she carried him, she gave his body to Skywalker who laid him on the ground. With this, Tano informed them that Piell had died honorably and that she had his half of the coordinates. The group then brought him to a lavafall where Kenobi and Skywalker used the Force to drop his body into the lava and took a moment to honor him before they moved on. As the group continued their journey to the rendezvous point, they finally came across the island where they were meant to be extracted, Cody and Skywalker used their ascension guns to launch a cable so that they could climb over to the island as it was surrounded by lava. However, more commando droids then arrived on STAPs along with Sobeck, who had finally decided to deal with them himself.\n\nAs Sobeck was knocked out of the sky by Fives, he grabbed onto Tarkin and began to choke him, preparing to throw him into the lava. Acting on her training from Skywalker, Tano quickly killed him with her one of her lightsabers in order to save Tarkin. Tarkin then thanked Tano and informed Skywalker that he had trained her well. Just then, Koon finally arrived with the gunship as more crab droids arrived. Tano, as well as the rest of the group, easily managed to board the gunship and they took off while being flanked by Jedi Masters Saesee Tiin, Adi Gallia, and Kit Fisto flanking them in their own interceptors. As the Venators prepared to jump to hyperspace, the gunship safely made its way back into the hangar as Koon gave Admiral Barton Coburn the go-ahead to jump to hyperspace, leaving Lola Sayu behind.",

He quickly ordered the heavy cannons to commence firing on the exposed Separatists and their Armored Assault Tanks, to great effect. With Republic Admiral Wullf Yularen and Jedi Grand Master Yoda arriving with reinforcements to complete the process of securing Christophsis, Rex allowed himself to breathe and personally feel the deaths of his men, acknowledging the pain that came with losing them.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The last meeting\n\nAfter allying herself with the Mandalorians, Tano was given a new outfit made from beskar and set to work trying to find where Maul was hiding. Tano and Kryze also developed a friendship, with Kryze becoming a combat mentor to the former Jedi. After some time, Tano and the Mandalore resistance managed to pinpoint Maul's location on Mandalore with the help of the information Tano managed to retrieve from the Pykes on Oba Diah. Knowing they did not have the numbers for a siege of Mandalore, Tano and Kryze contacted Skywalker and Kenobi, who were finishing up a battle on the planet Yerbana, for their assistance in the siege. Using the subspace frequency \"Fulcrum,\" Tano and Kryze were met by Yularen who then contacted Skywalker and Kenobi, calling them back to the ship.\n\nOnce Skywalker and Kenobi arrived, Tano greeted Skywalker and commented on how long it had been since they had last seen each other. There was a brief silence before Skywalker asked how Tano had been and where she was. Responding to Skywalker's inquiry, Tano said she was alright, but knew that they did not have time to make irrelevant conversation and needed to divulge the important information she and Kryze had immediately. After Kenobi asked what this information was, Tano explained that they had finally managed to locate Maul and that they might be able to capture him if they moved swiftly.\n\nWith this information, Skywalker and Kenobi allowed the Mandalorians onto their Star Destroyer. As Tano exited the boarding ramp, R2-D2 greeted her arrival warmly. After this, she walked towards Skywalker who said he was extremely glad to see her, but she interrupted him and told him that they would have to catch up another time as every moment they wasted there gave Maul more of an opportunity to escape, as noted by Kryze. With this, the group ventured to the strategy center to discuss the supposed siege. Arriving there, Tano explained to Kenobi and Skywalker that they had managed to pinpoint Maul's location using information she had managed to gather on Oba Diah to which Skywalker asked why she was on Oba Diah in the first place. However, Tano waved this aside by telling him that that wasn't really relevant at that present moment.\n\nAfter Kryze explained that Maul was on Mandalore, Kenobi asked what they wanted from the Republic. Kryze, embarrassed, explained that she didn't have the numbers that would be needed for a siege of this size and needed the assistance of the Republic's clones in order for a complete lockdown of Sundari. To gain this, she proposed that she would give them Maul once he was captured and that she would take the leadership role on Mandalore once the siege concluded. Nevertheless, Kenobi explained that if they aided them, it would break ancient treaties between the Republic and Mandalorians and that the two sides would once again be drawn into a war. To this, Kryze asked them what one more war was, but Skywalker explained that they didn't want another war when they were already fighting in the Clone Wars. With this, Kenobi explained that he would ask for the Jedi Council's guidance in this matter, but Kryze, desperate for help, yelled at him that there was no time to speak with them and attempted to incite Kenobi's feelings for Satine, whom Maul had murdered months prior. She scornfully looked at Kenobi as he walked away to speak with the Council, refusing to allow his feelings to control his actions. Kryze then angrily walked away as Tano watched her departure.\n\nWith Kryze gone, Skywalker quipped that that meeting had gone well with everything taken into account. Hearing Skywalker's witty remark, Tano turned back towards Skywalker and said that he and Kenobi hadn't changed much since the last time she had seen them. Skywalker then asked if that was a bad thing to which Tano smiled. He then asked her to follow him as he had a surprise for her waiting in the hangar. As they walked towards the hangar, Tano watched as the clones saluted her as she passed by, commenting that the clones shouldn't salute her anymore since she had left the Jedi Order and therefore no longer commanded them. However, Skywalker explained that they were just showing respect for the years she spent with them serving on the front lines in the Clone Wars. As they arrived, the door moved aside to reveal Rex and fellow members of the 501st's 332nd Company with their newly painted helmets bearing her markings. With her now having seen them, Skywalker motioned for her to move through the lines of troopers as they had been waiting for her.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Aftermath\n\nAs day broke on Mandalore, Tano arrived with the captured Maul to regroup with Kryze. Upon exiting the gunship, Kryze exclaimed her disbelief in Tano's ability to capture Maul, which she noted she was impressed by and handed Tano her lightsabers back. In response, Tano noted that it was what the Jedi Council wanted, with Kryze following that by saying that it was still an impressive achievement due to the fact many had failed to capture Maul in the past. As they continued to walk, Tano noted that this achievement was due to the fact that she had learned from the best the galaxy had, including Kryze. However, Kryze was not flattered as she expressed that she wished she was proficient in something other than combat. With this, Kryze looked out at the ruins the siege had caused, and Tano followed up Kryze's previous statement by saying that the people of Mandalore needed a new type of leader. However, Kryze continued by saying that her sister had tried and failed to be a new type of leader for Mandalore, wondering if she could be any different.\n\nBefore they could continue, Rex approached the two and informed Tano that he had managed to contact the Jedi Council. Leaving Kryze, Tano asked if Skywalker was with them to which Rex noted that he had been when he had left to inform her about the meeting. Before leaving, Kryze turned to Tano and gave her her blessing to leave, telling her that she could handle Maul. With this, Tano left with Rex.\n\nAs Tano and Rex walked into the meeting via hologram, the members of the Jedi Council turned to look at the pair, with Windu noting that her mission had been a success. Tano confirmed this and reaffirmed their belief that she would be escorting Maul back to Coruscant once they departed. With this, Yoda thanked Tano for her service to which Tano said that she was just doing her duty as a citizen of the Republic. Yoda then asked if she did this act instead as a Jedi, but Tano followed this up by informing them that she was not yet ready to be called a Jedi once more. Moving on from this, Tano noted that she wished to speak with Skywalker, but was instead informed that Skywalker had left to inform Palpatine that Grievous had been located on Utapau. Having received an earlier report of Kenobi being sent to Utapau, Tano asked if he was the one who had engaged Grievous to which Yoda confirmed that he had indeed engaged the Separatist forces on the planet. With this, Tano noted that the war could be over soon if Kenobi managed to kill Grievous, but, in response, Windu noted that the war's conclusion depended on if Palpatine decided to end it or not. With Tano questioning what he meant, Windu explained that this was exclusively for the Council to discuss. Tano bowed her head and told Windu that she understood.\n\nThe briefing was subsequently adjourned, although Yoda remained in contact with Tano after the other masters ceased their transmission, and asked if she had more to say or if she had a message for Skywalker. However, Tano said that she had neither, neglecting the information she had received from Maul and informing the Grand Master that she would talk to Skywalker herself once he managed to make contact with him. With this, Yoda wished for the Force to be with Tano and cut off his own transmission. With the meeting over, Rex walked over and noted that Tano had neglected to inform them upon the information Maul had mentioned about Skywalker, but Tano waved this aside and simply confirmed that she hadn't. The two then walked out to regroup with Kryze and witness Maul's transport into their Nu-class transport.",

        "content": "# Rex - Mission to JanFathal[]\n\nOnce all of the Jedi and clones were on board, Coric piloted the shuttle out of the area, barely evading the pursuant battle droids. En route to Leveler, Devis thanked Rex for his men's efforts, but he avoided initiating a conversation with her so as to reflect on Vere's death. He noticed that Ross, Boro, Joc, Hil, and Ince had opened up a private comlink frequency and respected their privacy, knowing they needed to discuss personal matters, including the painful loss of Vere, without him overhearing. He instead voiced his congratulations to his men on the successful rescue, though he noted that JanFathal was lost to the Republic. Meanwhile, the Separatist destroyer Reaper attacked Leveler and forced Pellaeon's warship to flee to hyperspace before Coric's shuttle could dock, leaving Rex and his team to fend for themselves. With their main source of life support\u2014Leveler\u2014gone, Rex ordered Coric to disable all nonessential systems. Boro calculated that with their limited oxygen supply, they would only be able to make it halfway to the shipyards at Kemla Yard, the closest Republic-allied location. Instead, they elected to return to Athar and mount a last stand against the Separatist army there. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker arrived in the system aboard the V-19 Torrent starfighter Echo-97 and contacted Rex, who updated him on their situation. Rex and the others rendezvoused with Skywalker in Athar, where Skywalker was introduced to the rookie clones and the Altisian Jedi.\n\nRex and his men's spirits were lifted when Skywalker told them he had spotted several of the Separatists' hyperdrive-equipped CR-20 troop carriers, which could be used to escape off-world. Altis presently received word from his colleague Ash Jarvee that Leveler was returning to the system from a miscalculated hyperspace jump. In the meantime, Skywalker sent Rex, Masana, and the clone troopers to a road bridge along the Cadaman Royal Highway while he and the other Jedi seized a CR-20. Rex and his comrades would provide covering fire until the troop carrier lifted off and would then board the ship. Once Rex, Masana, and the clones were in position, Skywalker commandeered the troop carrier with Tano, Altis, Eris, and Devis and arrived to rescue them. Yet Ince was injured in battle with the droids, and Hil hurriedly treated him for his wounds. A Vulture droid approached and fired at some paving behind them, but Masana diverted the falling debris with the Force and edged over to attend to Ince. While Masana and the others carried the injured Ince onto the hovering troop carrier, Rex and Ross remained on the ground to keep the droid starfighter occupied.\n\nThe Vulture droid landed and advanced on the two clones in walking mode, and Ross got the droid's attention while Rex tangled its legs with his rappel line, pulling himself toward the droid. He hung on despite its attempts to throw him off, causing the droid to become increasingly more tangled in the line. Rex and Ross's combined blasterfire brought down the droid, and they escaped to the CR-20, which Skywalker promptly piloted toward Leveler. While the wounded Ince was stabilized, the battle-weary Rex manned the CR-20's blaster cannons with Tano, returning fire at the attacking Separatist armada. As soon as their CR-20 landed aboard Leveler, the assault ship escaped to hyperspace; Ince, meanwhile, was rushed to the medbay. Rex joined his comrades there, trying to endure the aggravating wait for developments in Ince's case. When Ince died from blood loss, Rex, devastated and furious with the loss of a second soldier within a single day, took refuge in the mess hall. Tano found him there and consulted him about the Altisian Jedi views on the Clone Army, a discussion that soon undermined Rex's own beliefs as well as Tano's. Accepting that he and his comrades were making the best of an unwanted situation, Rex finally regained stability with his principles, though Tano found it more difficult to do so.",

        "content": "# Rex - Outpost inspections[]\n\nWhile Cody, Hevy, and Fives confronted the battle droids at the entrance, Rex and Echo ushered several PLNK-series power droids, or \"plunk droids,\" containing the liquid Tibanna into the command center. As they wired the three plunk droids together, Rex encountered problems with the detonator's remote handset. Hevy offered to stay and repair the remote, allowing Rex, Cody, Echo, and Fives to escape outside via a maintenance pipe. Rex assumed that Hevy had summarily fixed the remote and was right behind them, but when he told Hevy to detonate the explosives, he discovered that the trooper had not yet joined them. He contacted Hevy and ordered him to vacate the base, but Hevy stated that he would have to manually activate the charges due to the remote's defectiveness, ignoring Rex's protests. Although Rex and the others backtracked to help their comrade, Hevy sacrificed himself to destroy the base and warn the Republic of the Separatist invasion. The termination of the all-clear signal elicited an immediate reaction from the Republic fleet, which arrived and drove Grievous's invasion force out of the system. LAAT/i gunships collected Rex, Cody, Fives, and Echo from the moon and brought them aboard the Resolute. In the Star Destroyer's hangar, Skywalker and Kenobi commended Echo and Fives for their valor, awarding them medals, and also honored Hevy's sacrifice. Rex, impressed by the efforts of the former \"shinies,\" inducted Fives and Echo into the 501st Legion.",

        "content": "# Rex - Outpost inspections[]\n\nRex was stationed with Skywalker, Tano, and Admiral Yularen aboard Skywalker's flagship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute, when it was deployed to the Bith system during the emerging threat of a new Separatist superweapon. After the enemy weapon executed a devastating assault on Plo Koon's forces in the nearby Abregado system, the Resolute was reassigned to protect the Republic's supply convoys alongside Kenobi; his flagship, the Negotiator; and the rest of their fleet. Skywalker thereafter divided his armada to increase their defensive perimeter and departed with Tano to scout ahead for enemy activity. Rex was present on the Resolute's bridge with Yularen when Kenobi contacted them to check on their progress as well as Skywalker's whereabouts. Yularen reported that the convoys were on schedule and also informed Kenobi of Skywalker's orders. Skywalker and Tano soon discovered that the Separatist superweapon was the Malevolence, a powerful Subjugator-class heavy cruiser that was equipped with an ion pulse cannon. Rex later reviewed the file on the Abregado incident, hoping that it would give him an edge in future battles against the Separatists. The Resolute was again reassigned, this time to join a Republic naval strike on the Malevolence near the Kaliida Nebula. The ensuing Battle of the Kaliida Nebula saw the battleship eradicated, its threat to the Republic ended.\n\nRex and Commander Cody were next assigned to inspect several small but integral Republic bases and listening posts. Their first inspection site was a tracking station in the Pastil system. Upon arrival on Pastil aboard Rex's Nu-class attack shuttle, the Obex, Rex began assessing the outpost with Cody and commented on the station's extreme cleanliness. Trooper Stripe informed them that an MSE-series droid nicknamed \"Rodent\" maintained the base, mentioning that the droid had a glitch and spent hours cleaning the outpost. Recognizing the droid's characteristics as those of a spy droid, Rex called out a Code Aurek alert and ordered the facility's troopers to track down Rodent. The rookie clones were unaware of Rex's suspicions and initially thought he was crazy, but when Rex found the droid and blasted its body, the droid's wheels activated of their own accord and fled, a feature uncommon in regular MSE droids. The troopers eliminated three of the wheels, and when the fourth made for a grate, Stripe destroyed it with a thermal detonator; the resulting explosion caused a significant amount of damage to the hallway. Amused with Stripe's solution, Rex told the troops to clean up the mess before leaving the station with Cody.\n\nAfter Cody reported their successful inspection to Skywalker and Kenobi, who were aboard the Resolute, he and Rex proceeded to Rishi Station, an outpost in the Outer Rim's Rishi system. They were unaware that Confederate BX-series droid commandos had just overrun the base. When Cody contacted Rishi Station for landing authorization, a droid commando posing as a clone trooper answered the transmission. Hearing the trooper's droid-like responses, Rex sensed that something was amiss but continued with Cody to the moon where the outpost was located, with Cody placing him in charge of the inspection. Upon landing at the station, Rex noted the absence of an on-duty deck officer, remarking that such an error was sloppy. A droid commando disguised in clone armor came out to greet Rex and Cody. When Rex caught sight of a droid attack flare launched from close by, he promptly shot the \"trooper\" who had greeted them in the head. At first, Cody was shocked with his brazen behavior, but Rex removed his victim's helmet to unmask the disabled droid.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Order 66\n\nTano declined this, however, to Rex's puzzlement as he didn't see any other way besides killing them in a bid to escape. Tano then walked over to the viewport to see the army of clone troopers standing before them and informed him that she had an idea. As Rex began to look slightly puzzled, Tano handed him back his helmet and assured him that she thought it was a good idea. She then knelt down and asked the droids if she could count on them to which all three of them agreed that she could. With their acknowledgement, she stood up and informed her four allies that she would explain her plan on the way to the hangar. As they approached the hangar, Tano explained that Rex would feign her capture to the clones as a distraction, while the droids snuck past them and activated the lifts beneath clones' feet. Before they arrived, Rex took Tano's lightsabers to make their ruse seem more plausible.\n\nAs Rex and Tano reached the hangar, Rex asked for the clones to hold their fire as he escorted a supposedly captured Tano with her arms on her head. As the clones prepared to fire on Tano, Rex once again asked them to hold their fire as Jesse told him that he had his orders to execute Tano and asked him to eliminate her or else he would do it himself. As the clones continued to aim their blasters upon Tano, Rex explained that the order had been to eliminate the Jedi for treason and that since Tano was no longer a Jedi, she should not be considered a traitor under the directive. This caused Jesse to briefly pause before he informed Rex that he himself had informed the clones that they were under special orders from Darth Sidious to eliminate Tano, even though she was no longer considered a Jedi, as well as any clone who disobeyed the directive. As Jesse spoke, Tano turned to look at the droids who informed her that they needed a little more time, leading Tano to tell Rex to keep the clones talking for a little longer.\n\nResponding to what Jesse said, Rex tried to appeal to his friend one final time, but the ARC trooper, despite taking another moment to process what Rex said, stripped Rex of his title of commander, accusing him of treason. However, the droids turned towards Tano again and signaled that they had completed their task prompting Tano to ask Rex if he was ready, which he responded to by saying that he hadn't much liked being a commander anyway. As Jesse signaled for the clones to fire upon Rex and Tano, Tano's plan came to fruition; the lifts beneath the clones began to drop. With that, Tano pushed Jesse down the shaft with the Force and was thrown back her lightsabers by Rex.\n\nNow wielding her lightsabers once more, Tano, alongside Rex, easily managed to incapacitate the remaining clone troopers. However, as they fought the remaining clones, Maul appeared inside the hangar, also attempting to escape the crashing Star Destroyer. As Rex and Tano continued to fight the remaining clones, Maul ran past them, and, noticing Maul running past them thanks to G-G, Tano notified Rex. Finding the remaining clones insignificant, Tano chased after Maul and allowed Rex to deal with the rest of them as he followed her. As she arrived to stop Maul, he threw several crates at her with the Force, telling her that she had wanted this chaos and threw a cart at her as she jumped to avoid it. Finally arriving to attack Maul, Tano slashed at Maul before he used the Force in a powerful push, knocking her all the way back to the lifts; however, before she could fall into the starship bay below, G-G managed to use one of his cables to help her back up. As G-G helped Tano up, the clones began to regain consciousness, forcing Tano to use one of her lightsabers to defend against the incoming blaster bolts.",

For the mission she chose Miara, Neera and the Rodian Kolvin to accompany her; Miara to help set the charges, Neera for her swift thinking, and Kolvin for his nimbleness. Due to the weak stormtrooper security, Tano and her team infiltrated the spaceport easily. While planting charges, Tano took her time to observe the patrols, feeling that they would not be able to infiltrate the compound as easily after. After observing a couple patrol cycles passed, Neera advised the Togruta that it was time to leave.\n\nTano branched from the group with Miara to continue setting charges, and the Togruta was reminded of her time on Onderon during the Clone Wars. During their work, she also discovered that Miara had smuggled a real bomb, asking the girl of it. Miara tried to dismiss this as an accident, but the Togruta pressed her inquiry, asking if her companion had been plotting behind her back. The pair were briefly interrupted when another patrol passed, this time scanning the compound for a moment. After they passed, Tano and Miara continued their mission and soon reunited with Neera and Kolvin.\n\nAfter evading stormtrooper sentries, Tano and her team headed back to Selda's cantina. There, she discovered that Vartan had sent Hoban and Kaeden on an unsanctioned mission to attack the Imperial admin building. Since the uprising was premature, Tano urged the farmers to return home and to disavow any knowledge of what had happened that night to evade any arresting that could ensue. However, Miara refused to abandon her older sister. A reluctant Tano agreed to rescue Kaeden and the others but warned Miara to follow her orders and bring the explosives.\n\nTano ran through the streets with Miara and Neera towards the Imperial admin building when the alarms sounded from the Imperial compound, where the damage to the walkers had been discovered. As they continued to the compound, an explosion sounded and Miara denied that it was one of her bombs. When Tano told her two comrades to reveal the real plan, Neera revealed that Hoban had split the resistance fighters into three groups and that they were armed with explosives and blasters.\n\nTano ordered Miara to hide in the caves and Neera to bring the remaining resistance fighters to the caves. Tano decided to disable the Imperial tanks. When Miara asked \"Ashla\" what she was going to do, Tano responded that she would head to the thickest part of the fighting and evacuate as many people as she could. Tano also confided that she was a veteran of the Clone Wars when Miara asked again where she had come from. After separating from Miara, Tano and Neera headed to the Imperial compound, where Hoban's ill-equipped fighters had been repelled by the garrison's heavy artillery and the five remaining survivors including Hoban and Kaeden were pinned down by enemy fire.\n\nWhile Neera rounded up the surviving farmers, Tano planted explosives behind the Imperial tanks. These explosives immobilized the vehicles, halting the Imperial advance. Tano then took the opportunity to lead the five survivors to safety, knocking a stormtrooper to the ground and stealing the soldier's blaster. While fleeing the fighting, Tano and the farmers were blocked by a row of stormtroopers. Hoban surrendered but was gunned down by the troopers. Before these stormtroopers could execute the remaining survivors, though, Tano used the Force to fling the stormtroopers' blasters to the ground. Tano and the Raadian farmers then fled to the caves, with the former using the force to deflect artillery.\n\nAfter arriving in the caves, the resistance fighters turned to Tano and Kaeden told her that she had some explaining to do. With Neera being sedated to prevent her from harming herself, the farmers took some time to be quiet before Tano decided to reveal her identity as a former Jedi apprentice. Kaeden was angry with Tano for not revealing her Jedi identity since she could have saved Hoban's life and stormed off before the Togruta could continue explaining herself. Having been discovered by the Empire, Tano considered leaving to avoid drawing further attention from the Empire. While meditating, Tano was interrupted by Miara, who informed her that her sister Kaeden had left the caves and headed back to town. Tano instructed Miara to stay in the caves with Neera while she went to find Kaeden, knowing that the Imperials would catch her.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Siege of Mandalore\n\nArriving at Mandalore, Tano boarded a gunship alongside Kryze, Rex, and ARC trooper CT-5597 \"Jesse\" and joined the assault team in their approach to Sundari. During their approach, Prime Minister Almec contacted them and questioned them on why the Republic was attacking Mandalore, but after Kryze announced her presence to Almec, declaring their knowledge of him being a puppet of Maul, Almec understood. As he informed her that this attack would make her an enemy to the citizens of Sundari, she ended the transmission, noting that she didn't care. Tano turned to address Kryze and commented on how much of a difference there was between her and her sister, Satine. Kryze then contacted Ursa Wren, another one of the Nite Owls, and asked her if she could confirm where Maul was located, but Wren was only able to confirm that he had not yet left the city and also informed them that Maul's forces were preparing for combat.\n\nAs she ended the transmission with Wren, their gunship began to violently shake as Maul's forces had arrived and had begun their attack. They opened the gunship's doors to see the carnage ensuing outside as a gunship was destroyed next to them, forcing Tano to shield herself from the oncoming debris. Shortly afterwards, everyone aboard their respective gunships left to engage the enemy in the air using their jetpacks. Rex apologized for not bringing Tano one, however, Tano instead smiled and informed him that she didn't one, declaring a race to the surface between the two.\n\nJumping out of their gunship, Tano ignited both of her lightsabers and landed on another gunship, destroying both of the attacking super commandos' jetpacks with her lightsabers. Noticing more super commandos inside another gunship, she jumped down onto it, destroying one of their jetpacks before jumping inside the gunship and kicking two of the others. She then sliced the blasters off two other super commandos before kicking one and pushing another into the side of the gunship with the Force. Before leaving, she kicked one of the last super commandos aboard before destroying the last super commando's jetpack, allowing her to hitch a ride as it sputtered out before landing on a Kom'rk-class fighter/transport.\n\nWhile running across the fighter, Tano noticed a crashing gunship. Landing atop it, she noticed the pilot's ejector seat had failed and needed assistance escaping the gunship. In order to do this, she used her lightsabers to cut the top off of the cockpit, allowing the pilot's ejector seat to launch as the pilot thanked her. Before the gunship crashed, she hitched a short ride as the super commandos on the surface prepared to fire at her. Jumping down onto a platform, the gunship exploded behind her as the super commandos began to fire at her, forcing her to deflect their blaster bolts, allowing her to kill several of them. As she continued to defend herself, Wren and many other Mandalorians arrived alongside Rex. With Rex's arrival, Tano mentioned that she had beaten him to the surface, reminding Rex that some things never changed. The two friends then rushed into Sundari.\n\nShortly afterward, Gar Saxon, one of the leaders of the super commandos, escaped into the Undercity of Sundari, taking several super commandos along with him. Watching the fighting occurring in the city atop a balcony, Tano watched as Rex returned from his scouting mission and confirmed to them that Maul had not yet been found. With this news, Kryze informed them that she and her Mandalorians would be heading to the Sundari Royal Palace to capture Almec and ordered her to find Maul as they would not be able to sustain a long siege. After Kryze left, Tano ordered Rex to support Wren at Sundari's docks in order to ensure Maul didn't escape. Before he left, Rex informed Tano that if Maul wasn't in Sundari then the entire siege would be playing into his plans. Just then, Clone Captain CT-0292 \"Vaughn\" contacted Rex, informing him that they had a lead on Maul's location as Tano and Rex rushed off to go investigate the situation.\n\nAfter being dropped off by a gunship, Tano ventured into the Undercity and was met by Vaughn, who informed her that they had engaged Saxon, but he escaped into an access tunnel, seeming to be in a hurry. Tano asked what was down there and Vaughn told her that it was a series of mainly sewer tunnels and conduit access points, but he didn't know if it led outside of the city. Tano then ordered the clones to move in to investigate where the tunnels led.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, they were walking into a trap as another leader of the super commandos, Rook Kast, was prepping her super commandos to ambush Tano and her forces. As they continued to explore, Kast emerged from hiding and fired an explosive at them, forcing Tano to use the Force to divert the explosive on an alternate path. However, it still exploded near them, knocking Tano to the ground and briefly disorienting her and her forces. As Tano recovered herself, Vaughn and the rest of the clones chased after Kast and her super commandos, ignoring Tano's cries for them to wait. As Tano followed the trail of bodies, she was led to an opening in the Undercity where Vaughn apologized for his actions, dying while she held his hand.\n\nShortly thereafter, the super commandos rushed in and surrounded Tano who ignited her lightsabers to defend herself as Maul similarly emerged from hiding. Upon his emergence, Maul explained that he had been hoping for Kenobi to show up instead of Tano and asked her why she was here instead. Tano then looked around at her opponents and readjusted her stand, turning her head back to Maul. Maul proceeded explained that he did not know who Tano was to which she said that she knew who he was. Maul went on to say that he assumed that they both mutually knew several people.\n\nAs Maul spoke, Tano pressed a button on her wrist comm, informing Rex that she needed assistance. While Rex traced her signal, Maul explained that he was certain Kenobi would've come instead of sending Tano to which she explained that he was needed at the Battle of Coruscant as opposed to fighting Maul. Maul then began to wonder if Sidious' plan was finally coming to fruition, but did not explain as much to Tano. Maul then asked why he sent Tano to which she taunted Maul by asking him to surrender so that they could both go and ask Kenobi themselves. However, Maul explained that that would be pointless as he believed the Jedi and the Republic would soon be toppled by Darth Sidious.\n\nHowever, before they could finish talking, Rex and several other clones arrived, attacking two super commandos from behind as Maul ignited his lightsaber and attacked Tano who just barely managed to defend herself in time. However, after they very briefly fought, Maul declared that it was not time for their true confrontation to take place and pushed Tano back. Before she could recover, Maul picked Rex up with the Force and tossed him into her. Maul, Kast, and one other super commando then escaped to which Tano ordered her men to chase after them as she recovered and chased after him herself. As they split up, Tano chased after what she thought was Maul, but after attempting to take a shortcut, ran into Rex instead, losing Maul. Knowing they had failed, Tano declared that they had lost him.\n\nAfter Maul's escape, Tano met with a hologram of Kenobi along with Rex in the Grand Salon of the Sundari Royal Palace while overlooking a hologram of Sundari itself. During their conference, Kryze walked over and informed the group that firefights were still occurring in Sector 11 and congratulated the clones on how effective they had performed in the siege; however, she also noted that Maul still needed to be in custody by the end of it or the entire siege would've been for nothing. With this, Tano noted that while she was in the Undercity, Maul mentioned the name of Darth Sidious to which Kryze asked Kenobi who he was, but Kenobi could share very little information on him, only being able to tell them what the Jedi Council suspected.\n\nAfter Rex turned off the holo-map for Sundari and motioning the astromech droid away, Kenobi informed the group that the council suspected that Sidious was a Sith Lord who had orchestrated the Clone Wars and had played both sides throughout the entire conflict. He then went on to note that he learned the name from Count Dooku on Geonosis, but any chances of learning more about Sidious from him were severed after Skywalker beheaded him during the Battle of Coruscant, briefly shocking Tano. After this, Kenobi noted that by capturing Maul, they may be able to discover the mystery behind Sidious and put the final pieces of the puzzle into place. With this, Tano asked for more troops, but Kenobi informed her that that would not be possible from his front as he was being sent to hunt down General Grievous on Utapau. Tano then asked if Skywalker could reinforce them, but, instead, Kenobi asked for Rex and Kryze to leave them while he talked with Tano alone.\n\nWith their departure, Kenobi informed Tano that Skywalker had been assigned to spy on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by the Jedi Council, which Tano found distasteful. When she asked why, Kenobi told her that the Galactic Senate had allowed Palpatine to stay in office far longer than his term allowed, even with the emergency powers granted to Palpatine shortly before The Clone Wars Begin and that the council was suspicious of Palpatine's true intentions. Tano then noted that Palpatine had been a great friend to Skywalker for a long time and that she did not believe he would be happy with his current assignment. Kenobi affirmed her suspicions and said that it was best for her to talk with him. Tano was displeased with this, believing that Kenobi was asking for her to hold up the Council's judgment in the situation, not believing she was the right person for that role after everything they had put her through. However, Kenobi relented and admitted that the Council wasn't always right in its decisions, which was why he was asking for her help.\n\nJust then, Rex rushed in, apologizing to both for interrupting them, but telling the two that there had been an attack in the Undercity. Kenobi allowed Tano to go and, as she ran off, she began to ask the Jedi Master to tell Anakin something. Kenobi did not let her finish, simply responding that he would. Tano then rushed off to the Undercity as Kenobi watched.\n\nArriving back in the Undercity, Tano immediately received news that the clones there were ambushed on their way to reinforce C-deck leading Tano to order Rex to reinforce the location and him to run off to fulfill his orders. After this, Tano walked over to an injured clone named Sterling who had called her name. He informed her that Maul tore right through their defenses, asking about Tano the entire time. Eventually, Maul realized that Jesse was the oldest clone in the unit present by looking into his mind and had most likely served under Tano for longer, so he took him deeper into the Undercity as a prisoner in order to get as much information from him as possible. With this, Tano looked deeper into the Undercity.\n\nSoon after, Tano departed the Undercity and went to the royal prison alongside Rex and Kryze to interrogate Almec in order to learn more about Maul's plan. Upon entering his cell, Almec sarcastically mentioned how flattered he was upon the three being able to find the time to meet with him. After this, Kryze began the interrogation by asking Almec what Maul's plan was and how he was planning on escaping. In response, Almec informed them that Maul was not attempting to escape as he saw no point in it. Kryze believed this meant that Maul believed he could win, but Almec assured her that that was not the reason as he had become filled with a sense of dread in recent days. Tano then asked him if he had mentioned Sidious to which Almec said he hadn't yet at that point. Continuing the questions, Kryze asked why Almec wanted Kenobi here to which Almec said that he didn't exclusively want Kenobi and that there was another individual Maul wanted as well, however; Almec feigned his forgetting of this person's name.\n\nWith this, Tano asked Kryze to \"help\" Almec remember and, with this, he became very defensive, but was immediately shot by Gar Saxon, who had infiltrated to prison to assassinate Almec under Maul's orders so that he could not tell them anything. While Kryze ran after Saxon, Tano ordered Rex to get a medic as Almec informed Tano that Maul had had a vision in which the name had come to him. As Almec slowly died, Tano cried out for him to tell her the name of the individual. With this, Almec slowly breathed out \"Skywalker\" before dying in Tano's arms. Tano, briefly shocked by this, eventually recovered and rejoined Rex and Kryze\u2014who had lost Saxon in her pursuit of him\u2014in returning to the royal palace.\n\nAfter heading back to the palace, Tano, alongside Kryze, Rex, Wren, and several other Mandalorians, stood atop a balcony overlooking one of Sundari's streets where the citizens were being ordered to move to shelter locations by clones to which they received major backlash from the citizens for, not liking to clones present in Sundari. Eventually, Kryze had had enough of this and walked away as Tano and Rex followed close behind. As they entered the palace, Kryze informed Rex and Tano that the citizens of Sundari would not accept a Republic occupation for much longer and that neither would she. As a response, Rex argued that he and his men did not want to remain as a police force within the city with Tano adding that they would leave once Maul was captured and that Kryze would then be granted her opportunity to lead the people. However, as she said this, Maul appeared sitting in the throne of the Grand Salon along with the captured Jesse, whom Maul had managed to retrieve information from regarding Tano using the Force.\n\nKryze attempted to attack Maul by pulling out her WESTAR-35 blaster pistols and firing several blaster bolts at the Sith Lord before being stopped by Maul who used the Force to hold her in place. He briefly held her there before dropping her, leading to Tano and Rex to rush to her aid. Maul then released Jesse back into their care as a show of good faith towards them. As Jesse arrived back with them, Rex asked if he was alright to which Jesse apologized, noting that he had told Maul everything before Tano ordered Rex to get Jesse out of the palace. As Rex left, explosions began to ring outside\u2014having been orchestrated by Maul in a counterattack from the super commandos in order for Tano and him to be left alone\u2014causing Tano to turn her head and Maul to ask that one of them deal with the explosions. Tano asked for Kryze to go, which led Maul to stand up and announce that he and Tano would be fine together. With a final plea from Tano for her to leave, Kryze put her helmet back on and rushed outside to defend her people.\n\nNow left alone, Maul began to note how ignorant all combatants outside were, which led to Tano asking why Maul was doing this for either her or the Jedi Council to hear. To this, Maul noted that he specifically wanted to speak with her. With this, Maul mentioned Tano's betrayal by the Jedi Order and asked if this were true to which Tano asserted that she had left voluntarily. Maul acknowledged this but pointed out that her decision was motivated by the Jedi Council's hypocrisy. Him noting this caused Tano to briefly pause before Maul mentioned how he too had been a tool used by another power beyond himself.\n\nTano then walked forward and announced that she was there to bring Maul to justice, to which he claimed that justice was just the construct of the current power structure's morals. He also noted that he believed that the current government would soon be toppled, leading Tano to ask if Darth Sidious would be behind what he predicted. Maul then explained that Sidious was behind everything that had recently transpired in the galaxy, always orchestrating events from the shadows, but that would soon reveal himself. Tano then asked for Maul to join her and help the Jedi stop Sidious before he took control over the galaxy. However, Maul knew that the Republic had already fallen and that she just couldn't see this. He went on to explain that the Jedi would not be able to defeat Sidious and that their time had already passed, but that he believed that he and Tano might be able to defeat Sidious if they worked together.\n\nAs explosions continued to ring outside, Maul extended his hand for Tano to join him as she contemplated her decision. As she did this, an explosion shattered the glass around the pair. Eventually, Tano decided that she would help Maul on the condition that he answer her question on why he wanted Skywalker to come to Mandalore. To this, Maul explained that Skywalker was the key to Sidious' plan, which led Tano to ask if he was the Chosen One, but Maul knew that his role was in fact to destroy the Jedi and that he had long been groomed for his task. Tano then claimed that Maul was lying, but Maul remained firm in his beliefs, claiming that he had orchestrated the current war on Mandalore in order to lure Skywalker and Kenobi there in an effort to kill Skywalker, depriving Sidious of his prized pupil and his main pawn.\n\nTano rejected this answer and ignited her lightsabers, ready to fight Maul and take him into custody, claiming that Maul's vision was flawed and that she knew Skywalker well enough to know what he said could never happen. To this, Maul ignited his own weapon and claimed that he needed to teach her one last lesson. Maul then lunged at Tano and the two began their duel.\n\nTano managed to dodge several of his attacks before being forced to parry several of his other attacks. She then saw an opening in Maul's defenses and began to attack him, forcing him back on the defensive. Tano attempted to kick Maul to no avail, leading to him managing to elbow her in the face and forcing her shoto blade to leave her hand. Tano was now on the defensive once more, being forced to fight with only one saber; however, she soon managed to kick Maul, allowing her a brief opening to use the Force and retrieve her blade, forcing Maul to evade the saber as it returned to her hand. The fight then took a brief pause as Tano insulted Maul by claiming that if Skywalker had shown up, Maul wouldn't have lasted long in their fight to which Maul commented that Tano had Kenobi's arrogance before she swung her saber at him, mentioning that she likely had many qualities he disliked.\n\nResuming the fight, Tano managed to gain the upper hand but was eventually forced to jump back several times to evade Maul's attacks. Forced in a saber lock, Maul grunted, attempting to disorient Tano, but this gave her the opportunity to kick him outside of one of the palace's windows. Tano briefly paused to catch her breath before chasing after Maul to resume their fight.\n\nAs Tano emerged outside, she witnessed Mandalorian reinforcements arrive to aid the clones in warding off the super commandos' attack; however, as she turned her head, she noticed Maul attempting to escape atop a building leading her to chase him to the support beams of the domed city's ceiling. As she reached the support beams, Tano reignited her lightsabers and claimed that Kenobi had been right in his comment that Maul would be hard to kill. As Maul turned to look at her, Tano rushed at him as he reignited his own lightsaber to continue their duel.\n\nHe blocked her oncoming attacks as she lunged at him, briefly forcing her on the defensive before regaining herself and attempting to kick Maul, but he managed to evade. As the fight continued, Tano jumped back on one of the support beams and almost lost her footing, but managed to regain herself before Maul exclaimed that if she had joined him they could have destroyed Sidious together, but Tano knew that this would have only been for Maul to take his place, which she commented in response. As Maul jumped towards her, Tano managed to elbow and kick him to another support beam, causing Maul to briefly be caught off balance. She then once again lunged at him, but was forced off and kicked back, barely managing to hold onto a support beam.\n\nJust then, Maul's fighter arrived and asked for him to depart. As Maul shattered the glass on the dome of the city in an attempt to escape, Tano chased after him, jumping up and knocking him off of where he stood. As the two regained their balance once more, their duel continued. However, Maul soon managed to knock one of Tano's lightsabers free from her hand, causing it to tumble down to the fighting below. As she attempted to fight with only one of her sabers, Maul managed to easily disarm her of her second saber. Having gained the upper hand, Maul sliced the support beam the two were standing on, causing it to sag. Tano remained in a fighting position, ready for Maul to attack her once more. As Maul jumped onto her sagging support beam, he gave her one last chance to join him, which she refused leading to Maul continuing his attack, but being stopped when Tano managed to grab hold of his lightsaber and throw him off of the beam. She then stopped him from falling by using the Force as Maul cried out for Tano to let him die.\n\nAs gunships arrived to extract him, Maul wailed in terror of what was to come, claiming they were all going to die before one of the Mandalorians used the whipcord within his vambrace and entangled Maul within it, allowing Rex to stun him. Rex then told Tano that they would take it from there as Tano caught her breath and looked out at the crack in the dome Maul had created.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Teth[]\n\nFollowing the victory on Christophsis, Skywalker and Tano were assigned to rescue Rotta, the son of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, from enemy kidnappers. Their orders came as part of the Republic's overall effort to convince Jabba to grant the Grand Army access to hyperspace lanes running through Hutt-controlled space. Rex and Torrent Company accompanied the two Jedi to the planet Teth\u2014where Republic Advanced Recon Force trooper scouts had tracked the Huttlet\u2014in an Acclamator-class transport. Because the clifftop monastery where Rotta was being held was a half-mile off the ground and was being guarded by a detachment of battle droids, Skywalker elected to launch a vertical assault up the cliff face to reach the monastery. LAAT/i gunships ferried Torrent Company to the surface, and LAAT carriers brought a pair of AT-TE walkers along as extra support. When the monastery's droid defenders opened fire on the approaching craft, Clone Lieutenant Hawk\u2014the pilot of the gunship carrying Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and their men\u2014closed the gunship's blast shields to deflect the incoming fire. The gunships landed in the forest below the cliff, and the AT-TEs returned fire at the droids, providing cover for the Jedi and clones to take refuge in an overhang.\n\nRex soon sighted an object falling from the cliff, and what he initially believed was an explosive device turned out to be a fallen battle droid. Following Skywalker and Tano's lead, the men of Torrent Company employed their blasters' ascension cables to scale the cliff, with Rex using his rappel line to ascend it. As a vertical crossfire commenced, the droid cannonades felled one of the AT-TE walkers, severing its grip on the cliff. Rex watched in horror as the AT-TE plummeted to the ground, taking all of the troops beneath along with it. When B1 battle droids on Single Trooper Aerial Platforms flew in to attack the clones in mid-climb, Rex trained his blasterfire at the airborne droids before Skywalker eliminated them. Torrent Company reached the monastery and destroyed the remainder of the droid infantry, albeit at the loss of half of its men. Upon arrival at the summit, Rex called in a gunship to casevac their fifteen wounded troopers, assigning several men to look after them in the meantime. He and Skywalker deduced from the heavy droid presence that the Separatists were the Huttlet's captors.\n\nLeaving most of the men outside in the event of another assault, Rex took Sergeant Coric and troopers Lunn, Vaize, and Ayar to help Skywalker and Tano scour the monastery for the missing Huttlet. Entering the dimly lit castle, Rex and his men activated their helmet's headlights for better vision. Inside, the protocol droid 4A-7, claiming to be the monastery's caretaker, greeted and thanked them for liberating him from the battle droids. Learning from the protocol droid that the Separatists had kept their prisoners on the detention level, Skywalker and Tano proceeded there to rescue the Huttlet while Rex and his men stayed behind to guard the entrance. Though unable to confirm his suspicions, Rex correctly suspected that 4A-7 was not what he appeared to be\u2014the droid was aiding the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress as part of a Separatist plot to frame the Republic and the Jedi Order for Rotta's kidnapping. Rex returned to the monastery courtyard and finished securing the castle with his troops. As midday approached, he learned from Skywalker that Rotta had been found and sent Coric to help transport the Huttlet with a backpack. Upon their return, Skywalker and Tano prepared to leave Teth with Rotta aboard a gunship that Rex had on standby for them. However, Tano's discovery that the Huttlet was ill halted their preparations for an evacuation and forced them to consider another solution.\n\nWhile Skywalker and Tano were delivering a status report to Kenobi through R2-D2's holoprojector link, a pair of Confederate C-9979 landing craft approached the monastery and deployed Vulture droid starfighters and ground troops. With battle droids invading the courtyard, Rex and Skywalker mobilized Torrent Company to defend their position while Tano returned inside with Rotta. After briefly conferring with Skywalker on the weak chances of getting Tano and Rotta safely off-planet, Rex dispatched Sergeants Coric and Hez and their squads to provide covering fire for the rest of the company. Their remaining AT-TE walker was shot down, and Torrent Company began to take heavy losses. Rex joined his men in retreating into the monastery, and with everyone else inside, Skywalker ordered his captain to shut the entrance door. He initially refused, as Skywalker would be locked outside with the droids, but when his general tersely repeated the order, he complied and fired a blaster round at the controls. Skywalker used the Force to propel himself through the closing gap and into the entrance chamber, sealing all of them inside. With three-quarters of their men dead, several wounded, and only three medic-trained troopers remaining, Tano convinced her Master that it was best to find medical attention for the sick Rotta. Skywalker and his Padawan left with R2-D2 to escape from the castle while Rex remained with Torrent Company to hold their position.\n\nRex and his men braced themselves as the Separatist battalion\u2014under the command of Asajj Ventress\u2014disabled the door's lock mechanism, allowing B1, B2, and DSD1 dwarf spider droids to flood into the stronghold in overwhelming numbers. Rex watched as his men fell to enemy fire one by one before being knocked to the ground himself. Feigning death, he secretly contacted his surviving comrades through their private comm frequency and learned that only five of his men, including Coric, remained. As Ventress entered the antechamber and gave orders to an OOM command battle droid, Rex destroyed the droid with one of his DC-17 hand blasters and then targeted the Dark Acolyte. However, Ventress immediately drew her double-bladed lightsabers and deflected his laser shots. She telekinetically disarmed him of his blaster pistol and Force-choked him, demanding that he reveal Skywalker's whereabouts. Having been trained in mental resistance, Rex kept repeating his name, rank, trooper designation, and battle group to avoid succumbing to her influence. She finally gave up her interrogation and, after dropping the defiant Rex to the floor, performed a mind trick, ordering him to contact Skywalker and ask for his general's location.\n\nRex resisted Ventress's influence and commed Skywalker of his own accord, using a false voice and addressing him as \"Anakin\" instead of his usual \"General Skywalker\" to allude to Ventress's presence. Unaware of his exploit, Ventress threw him aside and departed to personally confront Skywalker, tasking her battle droids with guarding the survivors of Torrent Company. Though he suspected that his ribs had been broken, Rex mimicked unconsciousness to avoid attracting the droids' attention. He repeatedly checked in with his men over their private frequency, keeping them prepared to mount a last stand. Skywalker soon made contact via comlink, and because Rex had forgotten to divert the signal to his helmet, the battle droids overheard the device. As the enemy units converged on him, he destroyed several of the droids closest to him and stole an E-5 blaster rifle from one of them. Moving as one, the other 501st survivors\u2014Coric, Nax, Zeer, Del, and Attie\u2014sprang to their feet and also attacked their captors, pilfering blasters for themselves. Using the fallen AT-TE as cover, they engaged the droids in a crossfire. Rex took a painkiller from his utility belt medpac before reporting their situation to Skywalker. Eventually, Zeer planted explosives in an eviscerated super battle droid and detonated the unit once it had been sent back into the Confederate lines. The trap droid destroyed many of its comrades, but only a few minutes elapsed before the droids regrouped to resume their attack.\n\nRex and his comrades were able to bring down an advancing Vulture droid starfighter, using it as cover to combat the droids at a closer proximity. Nevertheless, the clone troopers were seriously outnumbered, and the battle droids demanded their surrender. At that moment, Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived at Teth with Commander Cody, the 212th Attack Battalion, and an armada under the command of Wullf Yularen. Leading an aerial assault on the droids, Kenobi jumped out of his Delta-7B starfighter to assist Rex and the other Torrent Company survivors while LAAT/i gunships deployed Cody and his men. Learning from Rex that Skywalker was most likely still in the stronghold, Kenobi left to find his fellow Jedi General. Eventually, Skywalker\u2014having found and commandeered the Twilight, an old spice freighter, with Tano and Rotta\u2014contacted Rex, reluctantly telling him that they would be unable to give support since returning Rotta to his father on Tatooine was still their priority. Rex understood his general's dilemma and replied that he and his men would be able to hold out thanks to Kenobi's aid. Under covering fire from his men, Rex charged at an advancing dwarf spider droid and planted a primed thermal detonator on it, jumping away in time to avoid the explosion that engulfed it.\n\nAs Rex and his men cut through the battle droids, Kenobi returned from a duel with Ventress. Rex voiced his doubt that Skywalker and Tano would be able to reach Tatooine in their dilapidated freighter, but Kenobi was confident that Skywalker's expertise at a starship's controls would prove adequate. After the Republic finally emerged victorious on Teth, Rex conferred with Cody amidst the settling dust, venting his frustration with the poorly handled operation. Although Rex was still devastated with the loss of Torrent Company, his friend stated that their efforts had not been in vain, as Skywalker and Tano had reached Tatooine with Rotta. The two clone officers accompanied Masters Yoda and Kenobi to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine to retrieve Skywalker and Tano, who had returned Rotta to his father and established a treaty with the Hutts for Grand Army access through Hutt Space. Upon meeting with Rex, Skywalker and Tano wanted to hear all the details of the battle's end, of the men who had won and paid the ultimate price for the victory. Despite his distress, Rex agreed to recount it to them. Though Torrent Company was replenished with new troops, the defeat of the original unit stayed with Rex for a long time.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Aftermath\n\nAs day broke on Mandalore, Tano arrived with the captured Maul to regroup with Kryze. Upon exiting the gunship, Kryze exclaimed her disbelief in Tano's ability to capture Maul, which she noted she was impressed by and handed Tano her lightsabers back. In response, Tano noted that it was what the Jedi Council wanted, with Kryze following that by saying that it was still an impressive achievement due to the fact many had failed to capture Maul in the past. As they continued to walk, Tano noted that this achievement was due to the fact that she had learned from the best the galaxy had, including Kryze. However, Kryze was not flattered as she expressed that she wished she was proficient in something other than combat. With this, Kryze looked out at the ruins the siege had caused, and Tano followed up Kryze's previous statement by saying that the people of Mandalore needed a new type of leader. However, Kryze continued by saying that her sister had tried and failed to be a new type of leader for Mandalore, wondering if she could be any different.\n\nBefore they could continue, Rex approached the two and informed Tano that he had managed to contact the Jedi Council. Leaving Kryze, Tano asked if Skywalker was with them to which Rex noted that he had been when he had left to inform her about the meeting. Before leaving, Kryze turned to Tano and gave her her blessing to leave, telling her that she could handle Maul. With this, Tano left with Rex.\n\nAs Tano and Rex walked into the meeting via hologram, the members of the Jedi Council turned to look at the pair, with Windu noting that her mission had been a success. Tano confirmed this and reaffirmed their belief that she would be escorting Maul back to Coruscant once they departed. With this, Yoda thanked Tano for her service to which Tano said that she was just doing her duty as a citizen of the Republic. Yoda then asked if she did this act instead as a Jedi, but Tano followed this up by informing them that she was not yet ready to be called a Jedi once more. Moving on from this, Tano noted that she wished to speak with Skywalker, but was instead informed that Skywalker had left to inform Palpatine that Grievous had been located on Utapau. Having received an earlier report of Kenobi being sent to Utapau, Tano asked if he was the one who had engaged Grievous to which Yoda confirmed that he had indeed engaged the Separatist forces on the planet. With this, Tano noted that the war could be over soon if Kenobi managed to kill Grievous, but, in response, Windu noted that the war's conclusion depended on if Palpatine decided to end it or not. With Tano questioning what he meant, Windu explained that this was exclusively for the Council to discuss. Tano bowed her head and told Windu that she understood.\n\nThe briefing was subsequently adjourned, although Yoda remained in contact with Tano after the other masters ceased their transmission, and asked if she had more to say or if she had a message for Skywalker. However, Tano said that she had neither, neglecting the information she had received from Maul and informing the Grand Master that she would talk to Skywalker herself once he managed to make contact with him. With this, Yoda wished for the Force to be with Tano and cut off his own transmission. With the meeting over, Rex walked over and noted that Tano had neglected to inform them upon the information Maul had mentioned about Skywalker, but Tano waved this aside and simply confirmed that she hadn't. The two then walked out to regroup with Kryze and witness Maul's transport into their Nu-class transport.\n\nAs they walked out, Kryze, Wren, and several other Mandalorians walked by with the captured Maul contained within an old Mandalorian vault. Kryze walked up to Tano and the two acknowledged each other with a bow of their heads with Rex leaving Tano to accompany the Mandalorians as they escorted Maul. As the Mandalorians boarded the transport, Tano acknowledged the vault and noted that it was impressive, leading to Kryze mentioning that the vault was from an era when the Mandalorians were at war with the Jedi. With this, Tano jokingly remarked that she thought Kryze's sister, Satine, had outlawed such devices as these while she was duchess of Mandalore, which Kryze said that she had and that this was the last one the Mandalorians possessed. With their conversation finished, Kryze and Tano shook hands and the two said their goodbyes as Tano left to board the transport.\n\nNow with Maul in their custody, the transport took off to board the Star Destroyer Tribunal. While onboard, Tano and Rex made conversation between one another. Arriving on the Venator, Tano and Rex exited the transport and made their way to the ship's bridge. As Tano and Rex entered the bridge, the officers present turned and saluted Tano with a smile on their faces. The Star Destroyer soon entered hyperspace as Rex and Tano watched.\n\nAs Tano looked into the void of hyperspace, Rex asked if something was on her mind, leading Tano to explain that all she had ever been since she was a Padawan had been a soldier, contrary to her training as a peacekeeper. To this, Rex said that all his life he had only been a soldier and that he and his brothers received a mixed feeling about the war because of it, but he knew that without the war, he and his brothers would've never existed. Tano then turned and smiled, telling Rex that the clones' existence was one of the few good things that had come out of the Clone Wars, nothing that the Republic would never have been able to find better soldiers and that it had allowed her to receive her best friend in Rex. The two then saluted one another as an officer walked in to report that a new briefing had come in and, when asked if she would like to join him to look at it, Tano declined, believing it was more good news. Tano then looked back into streaking blue void of hyperspace.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Order 66\n\nAs Tano stared into hyperspace, she received a vision of Windu dueling Palpatine within his office and Skywalker betraying Windu, but did not fully understand what she was feeling. With this, Tano rushed into the command center and informed Rex that she believed something terrible had happened to Skywalker. However, instead, the clones began to turn their blasters towards her in accordance with Order 66. Joining them, Rex asked for them to lower their blasters so that he could kill her himself and raised his own blasters, a tear rolling down his face as he attempted to fight his inhibitor chip, an organic brain implant that compelled each clone trooper to comply with the directive.\n\nWhile his whole body shook and a tear rolled down his face, Rex asked for Tano to find Fives before firing upon her. Tano, forced to jump out of the way, ran towards Rex and tackled him, igniting her lightsabers to defend against the other clones' incoming blaster bolts, managing to kill both attacking her. She then closed the blast door as Rex began to stand up, rubbing his head from being forced into the command console. However, Jesse along with several other clones arrived, forcing Tano to divert her attention as all of the clones present began to fire upon her. With this, Tano attempted to direct the blaster bolts into the wiring above in an attempt to escape. As she escaped, the clones believed they had managed to kill her, but soon found that Tano had instead escaped into a vent above.\n\nExiting the vents, Tano made her way to the detention level in a bid to free Maul from capture in an attempt to create a diversion for herself. As she arrived, members of the Coruscant Guard were taking aim at Maul, ready to execute him, but she instead used the Force to push one aside and knocked the other one out by throwing him into the ceiling. With this, Tano looked towards Maul and told him not to make her regret her decision before she freed him from captivity. As Maul fell out of the vault, he expressed his surprise that she had survived, but instead of feeling flattered, Tano held her lightsaber to his throat and asked him if he was behind the clone's turning. Maul instead explained that he did not know exactly what had transpired, but instead said that he was sure Tano had felt the voices crying out in pain and death as Jedi across the galaxy were killed, including Tano's former mentor Plo Koon. Tano then explained that her clones had turned against her and she didn't know why to which Maul began to laugh and say that he had not known what Sidious' had been playing, but that he now did\u2014the Grand Army of the Republic had turned against the Jedi Order.\n\nHe then stood up and said that Tano had done the right thing in seeking his help and asked her to follow his lead, but Tano instead held her lightsaber up to him once more and made clear that she just wanted to use him as a diversion and not as a partner. With this, Tano ordered Maul to go cause some chaos as Maul looked at her with hatred displayed on his face. As the two walked out of the cell, Maul asked for one of Tano's lightsabers so that he might be granted a fighting chance, but Tano declined his offer and commanded him to leave once more. Now having freed Maul, Tano made her way to the droid storage room to recruit help from the droids located there.\n\nAs clones ran by, Tano snuck her way through the Venator, eventually arriving at her destination. Once Tano arrived in the droid storage room, she reactivated her old astromech droid R7-A7 who was ecstatic to see her, but Tano told him to quiet down as she required his help. R7 began to beep profusely, but Tano continued to attempt to quiet him down as the other two droids CH-33P and RG-G1 activated. As they activated, the droids began to profusely ask Tano questions upon what was happening, but Tano couldn't give them answers as she didn't know herself; however, she asked them for their help in discovering why. With this, the droids pledged their allegiance to her as Tano ordered them to get started.\n\nWith all of them in agreement, Tano ordered R7 to patch into the central computer and search for any secure file in relation to CT-5555 as asked of her by Rex. As R7 searched, he discovered files in relation to an incident that occurred aboard a space station above Ringo Vinda between CT-5385 \"Tup\" and Jedi Master Tiplee as well as a report from Kaminoan doctor Nala Se that said that Fives had had a malfunction with his inhibitor chip. She went on to mention a grievance report filed by Rex, which Tano asked R7 to open for her, but soon discovered that it was sealed. In order to open it, Tano tried Skywalker's passcode of 8108, which managed to open the file. Upon opening the file, Rex said that the inhibitor chips within the clones' brains could possibly have an alternative purpose they did not yet know. With this new information, Tano took the droids in an attempt to capture Rex and remove his inhibitor chip.\n\nAs Rex rushed across a hallway, R7 and CH-33P stopped him, sealing the blast doors between him and the other clones to leave him and Tano alone. With Rex trapped, R7 displayed a hologram of Tano, informing Rex that she believes she knew why he turned against her and that she saw his report on Fives. On top of this, she informed him that he had been programmed to turn against her and that his mind had been altered by the inhibitor chip, continuing by saying that she could help him. As Rex took aim at R7 and asked where Tano was, she appeared behind him, with R7 electrocuting him in order to bring him to the medical bay. As Rex fell to the ground, Tano asked the droids to be careful as they had not been trying to hurt Rex. As clones began to yell from outside the blast doors, Tano asked CH-33P if all the doors were sealed between them and the medical bay, which he confirmed. With this, Tano lifted Rex and placed him on top of R7, G-G, and CH-33P, and the combined efforts of the three droids allowed Tano to bring him to the medical bay. As the clones broke through the blast doors, Tano sealed even more doors to cover their escape.\n\nReaching the medical bay, Tano placed Rex on the medical bed. With Rex in position, Tano ordered R7 to run a scan for the inhibitor chip within Rex's brain; however, the initial scans came up empty prompting Tano to ask the medical droid to check again. As they scanned once more, CH-33P alerted Tano that the clones had begun to hack into the door and, with this, Tano ordered G-G to reseal the door as fast as possible if the clones managed to break through. Tano then asked R7 once more if anything had come up in the scans, but nothing had yet been located.\n\nWith this news, Tano walked over to Rex and put her hands around his head, beginning to chant \"I am one with the Force and the Force is with me.\" Continuing to chant, the unconscious Rex began to join in as the inhibitor chip was finally located. With its location finally having been discovered, Tano ordered R7 to remove the inhibitor chip to which R7 originally objected by asking if it would work, but Tano didn't know, only clarifying that if it didn't, the four of them were dead anyway. While they attempted to remove the inhibitor chip, the clones finally broke through the door, and Tano, in an effort to ward them off, reignited her lightsabers. As the clones began to fire upon Tano, she deflected their blaster bolts and used the Force to throw several of them while CH-33P attempted to reseal the door. As the clones began to overwhelm Tano, Rex woke up from his surgery and used his blasters to kill several clones as CH-33P finally resealed the door.\n\nWith Rex awake, Tano asked if he was alright. Rex assured her that he was and apologized for turning against and almost killing her earlier. With that, Tano asked how widespread the inhibitor chips were and how many Jedi were currently being betrayed across the galaxy, to which Rex responded with the crushing news that the entire Grand Army of the Republic had betrayed their Jedi and had been ordered to hunt down and kill the remaining ones. However, soon after, the clones began to cut through the door again as Tano and Rex turned to watch.\n\nWith Rex now awake and on Tano's side, the two friends were ready to escape the Tribunal. Standing in front of the entrance as clones attempted to break through, Rex asked how Tano was planning on getting them out of the medical bay, to which she informed him that she had an idea. As Rex asked what her idea was, Tano instead asked Rex to set his blasters to stun as they were not attempting to kill any of them. As the clones continued cutting through the door, Rex informed Tano that they had almost finished cutting through, but Tano still told him to wait. As they finished cutting through, Tano used the Force to push the door out and knock several clones aside, making their escape easier. Briefly stunned, the three remaining troopers were easily knocked out by Rex; however, several more clones appeared from both sides as Tano rushed out of the med bay, lightsabers ignited, blocking each of their shots while Rex stunned all clones standing in their way.\n\nAs they fought the oncoming clones, Tano ordered R7 to find them a path off of the Star Destroyer. While doing so, R7 managed to close the blast doors around them, sealing off several oncoming troopers, allowing Rex and Tano to mop up the few remaining troopers. Now at a pause in the action, R7 informed Tano that all of the escape pods had been destroyed, leading Tano to conclude that taking a shuttle would be their best bet to escape. With this, Tano began to leave, but while she walked away Rex informed her that Maul had escaped his imprisonment, but Tano, having let him out herself, informed Rex upon this fact, to his surprise. He began to question her on why she would do such a thing, but she simply said that it was for a diversion as Tano began to rush for the hangar, asking Rex to hurry.\n\nAs they continued to run towards the hangar, the ship jolted as it exited hyperspace, having been stopped by Maul who had destroyed the hyperdrive using the Force, crippling it and causing it to be caught in the gravitational pull of a nearby moon. Finally arriving at the hangar's control center, Rex was the first to enter, stunning an unsuspecting officer shortly before Tano rushed in and used the Force to push one aside as Rex stunned the other two. As they reached the controls, Rex informed Tano that the clones had already locked everything down and that if they weren't trying to kill them, he would've been proud. As Rex said this, Tano ordered R7 to unlock the doors in Bay 12, CH-33P to prep the shuttle, and G-G to find out what had happened to the ship that had caused it to jolt. As G-G attempted to discover what happened, he informed the pair that the hyperdrive had been completely destroyed to Rex's disbelief. The two soon discovered that they had become entrenched in the gravitational field of a moon nearby. With this, Tano asked R7 to open the main hangar doors, and with that, they saw the oncoming moon, causing Tano to exclaim that they needed to get out of there. As the ship continued to jolt profusely, Rex asked about the status of the hangar doors as Tano asked about the shuttle. With that, R7 managed to open one of the hangar doors, revealing a shuttle for them; however, as R7 continued to open the rest of the hangar doors, it revealed an army of clone troopers, led by Jesse, waiting for them.\n\nAs the clones took their positions in the hangar, Rex quickly asked what they were going to do, but Tano admitted that there were too many clones standing in their path to make a break for the shuttle and that she didn't want to hurt any of them, leading Rex to tell her that the troops did not care about what she wanted. Continuing on, Rex told her that the Star Destroyer was going down and that all of the clones aboard were willing to die in order to kill them both. With that, Tano walked over to Rex and removed his helmet, revealing his distraught state. With this, Tano explained that Rex was a good soldier, but that every one of the clones trying to kill was too. Tano continued to state that they may be willing to die, but she wasn't willing to be the one to kill them, leading Rex to believe that she was admitting defeat.\n\nTano declined this, however, to Rex's puzzlement as he didn't see any other way besides killing them in a bid to escape. Tano then walked over to the viewport to see the army of clone troopers standing before them and informed him that she had an idea. As Rex began to look slightly puzzled, Tano handed him back his helmet and assured him that she thought it was a good idea. She then knelt down and asked the droids if she could count on them to which all three of them agreed that she could. With their acknowledgement, she stood up and informed her four allies that she would explain her plan on the way to the hangar. As they approached the hangar, Tano explained that Rex would feign her capture to the clones as a distraction, while the droids snuck past them and activated the lifts beneath clones' feet. Before they arrived, Rex took Tano's lightsabers to make their ruse seem more plausible.\n\nAs Rex and Tano reached the hangar, Rex asked for the clones to hold their fire as he escorted a supposedly captured Tano with her arms on her head. As the clones prepared to fire on Tano, Rex once again asked them to hold their fire as Jesse told him that he had his orders to execute Tano and asked him to eliminate her or else he would do it himself. As the clones continued to aim their blasters upon Tano, Rex explained that the order had been to eliminate the Jedi for treason and that since Tano was no longer a Jedi, she should not be considered a traitor under the directive. This caused Jesse to briefly pause before he informed Rex that he himself had informed the clones that they were under special orders from Darth Sidious to eliminate Tano, even though she was no longer considered a Jedi, as well as any clone who disobeyed the directive. As Jesse spoke, Tano turned to look at the droids who informed her that they needed a little more time, leading Tano to tell Rex to keep the clones talking for a little longer.\n\nResponding to what Jesse said, Rex tried to appeal to his friend one final time, but the ARC trooper, despite taking another moment to process what Rex said, stripped Rex of his title of commander, accusing him of treason. However, the droids turned towards Tano again and signaled that they had completed their task prompting Tano to ask Rex if he was ready, which he responded to by saying that he hadn't much liked being a commander anyway. As Jesse signaled for the clones to fire upon Rex and Tano, Tano's plan came to fruition; the lifts beneath the clones began to drop. With that, Tano pushed Jesse down the shaft with the Force and was thrown back her lightsabers by Rex.\n\nNow wielding her lightsabers once more, Tano, alongside Rex, easily managed to incapacitate the remaining clone troopers. However, as they fought the remaining clones, Maul appeared inside the hangar, also attempting to escape the crashing Star Destroyer. As Rex and Tano continued to fight the remaining clones, Maul ran past them, and, noticing Maul running past them thanks to G-G, Tano notified Rex. Finding the remaining clones insignificant, Tano chased after Maul and allowed Rex to deal with the rest of them as he followed her. As she arrived to stop Maul, he threw several crates at her with the Force, telling her that she had wanted this chaos and threw a cart at her as she jumped to avoid it. Finally arriving to attack Maul, Tano slashed at Maul before he used the Force in a powerful push, knocking her all the way back to the lifts; however, before she could fall into the starship bay below, G-G managed to use one of his cables to help her back up. As G-G helped Tano up, the clones began to regain consciousness, forcing Tano to use one of her lightsabers to defend against the incoming blaster bolts.\n\nAs she defended herself, Rex did all he could to assist her, stunning as many clones as he could using his blasters. However, Tano began to lose the fight as the blaster bolts began to hit her beskar-plated armor. The clones, realizing the droids were at fault, began to fire upon them, forcing CH-33P and G-G to move back. However, as this occurred, Maul stole the shuttle and began to use it to escape the Venator. Finally managing to fully climb up, Tano ran towards the shuttle and used the Force in an attempt to stop Maul from escaping. As she did this, Maul increased power to the thrusters, causing her to begin sliding across the floor of the hangar and forcing Rex to grab her hand to stop her from slipping away. However, reinforcements began to arrive in the hangar, which Rex noted to Tano, who was still attempting to hold Maul back. Being forced to divert his attention, Rex was forced to let go and defend her from the oncoming clones. Tano continued to strain and witnessed as R7 was killed by one of the clones' stray blaster bolts. However, seeing that Rex was beginning to become overwhelmed by the clones, Tano was forced to let go of the shuttle and allow Maul to escape. Tano then rushed back into battle alongside Rex.\n\nBeing forced to defend herself from all sides, Tano saw that they were vastly outnumbered and threw her lightsabers into the ground, using the Force to cut a hole through it in order to escape into the starship bay below. However, they were once again met by clones\u2014Jesse and the other troopers whom the astromechs had dropped below\u2014ready to fight them once again. As Jesse ordered for the clones to attack, Tano was once again forced to defend herself. Luckily, from above, CH-33P and G-G managed to manipulate the lifts once more, forcing many clones back up into the main hangar. However, the two droids' efforts did not go unnoticed and the two were promptly executed by the clones. Finishing off the remaining troopers, Rex and Tano began to look around the starship bay for another ship to escape with, coming up with nothing as most ships located there were under maintenance.\n\nEventually, Tano managed to spot a lone Y-wing starfighter, but, before they could reach it, they were once again attacked by the clones. In an attempt to reach the shuttle, Tano jumped across one of the lifts and used the Force to push Rex onto the Y-wing. As many more clones arrived on the lifts, Tano used the Force to push them all aside, but still began to be overwhelmed. Concurrently, the Star Destroyer began to break apart and lost all artificial gravity onboard, causing everything on the ship to begin falling towards the moon's surface. This forced Tano to use her lightsabers in an attempt to stop herself from falling. As she did this, Rex asked her to hurry up and rush to the Y-wing, leading Tano to muster enough energy to run across the surface of the hangar and attempted to jump onto the Y-wing, but fell the into open air as the Y-wing fell out of the hangar.\n\nTano began to fly through the open air as Rex searched for her within the Y-wing, eventually spotting her and opening the gunner's hatch for her to climb inside. Tano attempted to use the air around her to reach the Y-wing, but, as she grabbed hold, she lost her grip and flew away. Tano was now forced to use the debris to her advantage and ran across one of the destroyed engines in an attempt to regroup with Rex. With one final jump, Tano was forced to use the Force to pull herself closer to the gunner's seat, finally being able to grab hold and climb into the hatch. Having finally rescued her, Rex flew the Y-wing away as the Tribunal, and the clones, went down in flames.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Shipyards of Gwori[]\n\nAs warfare continued to devastate the galaxy, the Confederate Navy, outnumbering the Republic Navy fourfold, put the Republic's war effort at a supreme disadvantage. With the likelihood of being prematurely defeated in the war, the Jedi High Council decided to impair Separatist starship production by targeting the InterGalactic Banking Clan's Confederate-allied Gwori shipyards. Because the shipyards' exact location on Gwori's planetary surface had yet to be determined, the task of pinpointing it fell to Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi. To penetrate Gwori's defenses\u2014namely, a droid-operated blockade and a radiation beam that eradicated all life forms bound for the planet\u2014Skywalker chalked out a plan for a small strike force to be temporarily frozen in carbonite. R2-D2, whose presence would not cause much suspicion to the blockade's droid security, would then pilot the team to Gwori. After locating the shipyards, they would relay the coordinates to Generals Plo Koon and Saesee Tiin, who would eliminate the facility with a Republic squadron. Initiating preparations on Coruscant, Rex gathered a clone squad at carbonite freezing plant CT-642, where Skywalker assured his captain that they would not be frozen long enough for hibernation sickness to take effect. Rex and his men, along with Skywalker and Kenobi, were encased in carbonite with the addition of Tano, who had been ordered not to participate in the mission but nonetheless manipulated Admiral Yularen to grant her clearance.\n\nRex and the strike team proceeded to Gwori aboard the freighter VX-391, with R2-D2 at the controls. When the blockade's battle droids discovered that the ship was unregistered, R2-D2 was forced to release the task force and jettison from the vessel just before the battle droids shot down the freighter. The astromech droid freed Tano from her carbonite slab, and she in turn released Rex and the others. Once they had found the enemy facility, Skywalker and Kenobi sent Rex, Tano, R2-D2, and two other clone troopers to contact Koon and Tiin from a nearby communication tower. After the group broke into the station, Tano transmitted the shipyards' coordinates to Koon, Tiin, and Yularen, who were waiting in the Moskk system. Before Rex and his comrades could arrange to be evacuated from Gwori, the transmission was cut off when the shipyards' supervisor, Overseer Juhm, contacted the station and discovered the presence of the Republic strike team. Rex, Tano, and their men managed to flee with R2-D2 just before Juhm remotely destroyed the station, and Tano relayed the developments to Skywalker and Kenobi. While their superiors infiltrated the shipyards, Rex, Tano, and their team went to find cover on Gwori's plains, where a squad of jetpack-equipped B2-RP battle droids attacked them.\n\nAfter escaping from the droids, Rex and his comrades took refuge in a cave that they soon found was the current residence of a large lizard-like creature, which killed one of the clones before Tano could eliminate it. As time passed, the extended lack of communication from Skywalker and Kenobi led Tano to conclude that their commanders were in trouble. She decided that it was time to \"alter\" Skywalker's orders of staying concealed, and though Rex voiced some doubt, he left the cave with Tano and the other trooper. However, Juhm was waiting for them just outside with a squad of B2 super battle droids and killed their clone companion on sight. Presented with the choice of capitulating or being immediately gunned down, Rex and Tano decided to comply with Juhm's demands and were taken away, leaving R2-D2 back in the cave. As night fell, Juhm had Rex and Tano attached to electrically charged frames alongside Skywalker and Kenobi, who had been captured at the shipyards. Before departing, Juhm left a trio of IG-100 MagnaGuards to guard them from a horde of local spiders, his intent being to let them survive as a reminder to the shipyards' slaves of his absolute superiority. Although the four were tortured and electrocuted in turn, Rex grudgingly expressed his gratitude for the MagnaGuards' protection from the spiders.\n\nIn an attempt to free themselves, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi used the Force to destroy the MagnaGuards, and R2-D2 arrived and cut them and Rex from their frames before the spiders could attack. The team proceeded to the shipyards and convinced Juhm's slaves, who numbered over a thousand, to emancipate themselves from their servitude. At dawn the next day, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi stole one of the shipyards' near-completed Munificent-class star frigates and escaped aboard it with the ex-slaves, just as Koon and Tiin arrived with their team of bombers. Koon and Tiin led the BTL-B Y-wing starfighters of Hunter Squadron on their strike on the Banking Clan facility, dropping their munitions on the site. Skywalker, meanwhile, used their frigate's tractor beam to retrieve trooper Toomer, who had been left behind at the drop zone when his carbonite slab's controls malfunctioned, and headed for the Separatist blockade. However, the battle droids overseeing the blockade detected the multitude of life forms aboard the stolen frigate, and at Juhm's behest, they activated the radiation beam. Before the beam could vaporize Rex and the other passengers, Koon and Tiin intervened, disabling the scan gate that was projecting the beam. The two Jedi Masters hitched a ride on the vessel, as their hyperdrive booster rings had been destroyed, and they left the Gwori system for Coruscant, where Juhm's ex-slaves found employment with the Republic. Once Toomer had been freed from his carbonite, Rex reassured the disappointed trooper that there would be more fighting to come.\n\n",

They would also scavenge the remains of R7-A7 to rebuild him. Upon completion of the burial site, Tano stood over the fallen clones, taking out her lightsabers and looking at one of them one final time before dropping them to the ground and leaving them behind. Now fugitives and enemies of the Republic, Tano and Rex were forced to fake their own deaths and go into exile aboard their Y-wing. Tano also received a message from Kenobi sent to all surviving Jedi, warning to stay away from the Jedi Temple. She also came to understand that Palpatine had been a Sith Lord, and she was forced to stay on the run as Palpatine transformed the Republic into his Galactic Empire.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Jedi Order, Tano was listed amongst the Inquisitorius' priority targets of presumed survivors of the purge. Some years later during the early Imperial Era, the lightsaber she left behind was discovered and taken by Darth Vader, a Sith Lord who was in fact Tano's former master, Anakin Skywalker. Neither Tano nor Rex were aware that Maul's suspicions during the last days of the Clone Wars came true: Darth Sidious used Skywalker's frustration with the Jedi Council and his fear of losing his Amidala in childbirth to lure him to the dark side of the Force. Skywalker had clung closer to Amidala after losing Tano, who would have served as a counterbalance to his passions and fears, out of concern that she could leave him as well.\n\nAmidala ultimately did pass away, but her body was prepared by the mortician Commodex Tahn to make it look like she was still pregnant at the time of her death, keeping the existence of the children a secret from the Sith and, by extension, anyone who saw the late Senator's body. Wearing a hood to keep her identity a secret, Tano secretly attended Amidala's funeral in Naboo's capital of Theed, but she was noticed by Senator Bail Prestor Organa. She was left unaware of the existence of Skywalker's children. Parting ways with Tano, Rex and the rebuilt R7-A7, meanwhile, began to work against the newly formed Empire with Tano's friends Trace and Rafa Martez. When Rex reunited with Clone Force 99, he kept Tano's survival a secret, merely telling them that he had help when his chip was removed.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Teth[]\n\nFollowing the victory on Christophsis, Skywalker and Tano were assigned to rescue Rotta, the son of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, from enemy kidnappers. Their orders came as part of the Republic's overall effort to convince Jabba to grant the Grand Army access to hyperspace lanes running through Hutt-controlled space. Rex and Torrent Company accompanied the two Jedi to the planet Teth\u2014where Republic Advanced Recon Force trooper scouts had tracked the Huttlet\u2014in an Acclamator-class transport. Because the clifftop monastery where Rotta was being held was a half-mile off the ground and was being guarded by a detachment of battle droids, Skywalker elected to launch a vertical assault up the cliff face to reach the monastery. LAAT/i gunships ferried Torrent Company to the surface, and LAAT carriers brought a pair of AT-TE walkers along as extra support. When the monastery's droid defenders opened fire on the approaching craft, Clone Lieutenant Hawk\u2014the pilot of the gunship carrying Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and their men\u2014closed the gunship's blast shields to deflect the incoming fire. The gunships landed in the forest below the cliff, and the AT-TEs returned fire at the droids, providing cover for the Jedi and clones to take refuge in an overhang.\n\nRex soon sighted an object falling from the cliff, and what he initially believed was an explosive device turned out to be a fallen battle droid. Following Skywalker and Tano's lead, the men of Torrent Company employed their blasters' ascension cables to scale the cliff, with Rex using his rappel line to ascend it. As a vertical crossfire commenced, the droid cannonades felled one of the AT-TE walkers, severing its grip on the cliff. Rex watched in horror as the AT-TE plummeted to the ground, taking all of the troops beneath along with it. When B1 battle droids on Single Trooper Aerial Platforms flew in to attack the clones in mid-climb, Rex trained his blasterfire at the airborne droids before Skywalker eliminated them. Torrent Company reached the monastery and destroyed the remainder of the droid infantry, albeit at the loss of half of its men. Upon arrival at the summit, Rex called in a gunship to casevac their fifteen wounded troopers, assigning several men to look after them in the meantime. He and Skywalker deduced from the heavy droid presence that the Separatists were the Huttlet's captors.\n\nLeaving most of the men outside in the event of another assault, Rex took Sergeant Coric and troopers Lunn, Vaize, and Ayar to help Skywalker and Tano scour the monastery for the missing Huttlet. Entering the dimly lit castle, Rex and his men activated their helmet's headlights for better vision. Inside, the protocol droid 4A-7, claiming to be the monastery's caretaker, greeted and thanked them for liberating him from the battle droids. Learning from the protocol droid that the Separatists had kept their prisoners on the detention level, Skywalker and Tano proceeded there to rescue the Huttlet while Rex and his men stayed behind to guard the entrance. Though unable to confirm his suspicions, Rex correctly suspected that 4A-7 was not what he appeared to be\u2014the droid was aiding the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress as part of a Separatist plot to frame the Republic and the Jedi Order for Rotta's kidnapping. Rex returned to the monastery courtyard and finished securing the castle with his troops. As midday approached, he learned from Skywalker that Rotta had been found and sent Coric to help transport the Huttlet with a backpack. Upon their return, Skywalker and Tano prepared to leave Teth with Rotta aboard a gunship that Rex had on standby for them. However, Tano's discovery that the Huttlet was ill halted their preparations for an evacuation and forced them to consider another solution.",

Kryze walked up to Tano and the two acknowledged each other with a bow of their heads with Rex leaving Tano to accompany the Mandalorians as they escorted Maul. As the Mandalorians boarded the transport, Tano acknowledged the vault and noted that it was impressive, leading to Kryze mentioning that the vault was from an era when the Mandalorians were at war with the Jedi. With this, Tano jokingly remarked that she thought Kryze's sister, Satine, had outlawed such devices as these while she was duchess of Mandalore, which Kryze said that she had and that this was the last one the Mandalorians possessed. With their conversation finished, Kryze and Tano shook hands and the two said their goodbyes as Tano left to board the transport.\n\nNow with Maul in their custody, the transport took off to board the Star Destroyer Tribunal. While onboard, Tano and Rex made conversation between one another. Arriving on the Venator, Tano and Rex exited the transport and made their way to the ship's bridge. As Tano and Rex entered the bridge, the officers present turned and saluted Tano with a smile on their faces. The Star Destroyer soon entered hyperspace as Rex and Tano watched.\n\nAs Tano looked into the void of hyperspace, Rex asked if something was on her mind, leading Tano to explain that all she had ever been since she was a Padawan had been a soldier, contrary to her training as a peacekeeper. To this, Rex said that all his life he had only been a soldier and that he and his brothers received a mixed feeling about the war because of it, but he knew that without the war, he and his brothers would've never existed. Tano then turned and smiled, telling Rex that the clones' existence was one of the few good things that had come out of the Clone Wars, nothing that the Republic would never have been able to find better soldiers and that it had allowed her to receive her best friend in Rex. The two then saluted one another as an officer walked in to report that a new briefing had come in and, when asked if she would like to join him to look at it, Tano declined, believing it was more good news. Tano then looked back into streaking blue void of hyperspace.",

He then went on to note that he learned the name from Count Dooku on Geonosis, but any chances of learning more about Sidious from him were severed after Skywalker beheaded him during the Battle of Coruscant, briefly shocking Tano. After this, Kenobi noted that by capturing Maul, they may be able to discover the mystery behind Sidious and put the final pieces of the puzzle into place. With this, Tano asked for more troops, but Kenobi informed her that that would not be possible from his front as he was being sent to hunt down General Grievous on Utapau. Tano then asked if Skywalker could reinforce them, but, instead, Kenobi asked for Rex and Kryze to leave them while he talked with Tano alone.\n\nWith their departure, Kenobi informed Tano that Skywalker had been assigned to spy on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by the Jedi Council, which Tano found distasteful. When she asked why, Kenobi told her that the Galactic Senate had allowed Palpatine to stay in office far longer than his term allowed, even with the emergency powers granted to Palpatine shortly before The Clone Wars Begin and that the council was suspicious of Palpatine's true intentions. Tano then noted that Palpatine had been a great friend to Skywalker for a long time and that she did not believe he would be happy with his current assignment. Kenobi affirmed her suspicions and said that it was best for her to talk with him. Tano was displeased with this, believing that Kenobi was asking for her to hold up the Council's judgment in the situation, not believing she was the right person for that role after everything they had put her through. However, Kenobi relented and admitted that the Council wasn't always right in its decisions, which was why he was asking for her help.\n\nJust then, Rex rushed in, apologizing to both for interrupting them, but telling the two that there had been an attack in the Undercity. Kenobi allowed Tano to go and, as she ran off, she began to ask the Jedi Master to tell Anakin something. Kenobi did not let her finish, simply responding that he would. Tano then rushed off to the Undercity as Kenobi watched.\n\nArriving back in the Undercity, Tano immediately received news that the clones there were ambushed on their way to reinforce C-deck leading Tano to order Rex to reinforce the location and him to run off to fulfill his orders. After this, Tano walked over to an injured clone named Sterling who had called her name. He informed her that Maul tore right through their defenses, asking about Tano the entire time. Eventually, Maul realized that Jesse was the oldest clone in the unit present by looking into his mind and had most likely served under Tano for longer, so he took him deeper into the Undercity as a prisoner in order to get as much information from him as possible. With this, Tano looked deeper into the Undercity.\n\nSoon after, Tano departed the Undercity and went to the royal prison alongside Rex and Kryze to interrogate Almec in order to learn more about Maul's plan. Upon entering his cell, Almec sarcastically mentioned how flattered he was upon the three being able to find the time to meet with him. After this, Kryze began the interrogation by asking Almec what Maul's plan was and how he was planning on escaping. In response, Almec informed them that Maul was not attempting to escape as he saw no point in it. Kryze believed this meant that Maul believed he could win, but Almec assured her that that was not the reason as he had become filled with a sense of dread in recent days. Tano then asked him if he had mentioned Sidious to which Almec said he hadn't yet at that point. Continuing the questions, Kryze asked why Almec wanted Kenobi here to which Almec said that he didn't exclusively want Kenobi and that there was another individual Maul wanted as well, however; Almec feigned his forgetting of this person's name.",

As R7 searched, he discovered files in relation to an incident that occurred aboard a space station above Ringo Vinda between CT-5385 \"Tup\" and Jedi Master Tiplee as well as a report from Kaminoan doctor Nala Se that said that Fives had had a malfunction with his inhibitor chip. She went on to mention a grievance report filed by Rex, which Tano asked R7 to open for her, but soon discovered that it was sealed. In order to open it, Tano tried Skywalker's passcode of 8108, which managed to open the file. Upon opening the file, Rex said that the inhibitor chips within the clones' brains could possibly have an alternative purpose they did not yet know. With this new information, Tano took the droids in an attempt to capture Rex and remove his inhibitor chip.\n\nAs Rex rushed across a hallway, R7 and CH-33P stopped him, sealing the blast doors between him and the other clones to leave him and Tano alone. With Rex trapped, R7 displayed a hologram of Tano, informing Rex that she believes she knew why he turned against her and that she saw his report on Fives. On top of this, she informed him that he had been programmed to turn against her and that his mind had been altered by the inhibitor chip, continuing by saying that she could help him. As Rex took aim at R7 and asked where Tano was, she appeared behind him, with R7 electrocuting him in order to bring him to the medical bay. As Rex fell to the ground, Tano asked the droids to be careful as they had not been trying to hurt Rex. As clones began to yell from outside the blast doors, Tano asked CH-33P if all the doors were sealed between them and the medical bay, which he confirmed. With this, Tano lifted Rex and placed him on top of R7, G-G, and CH-33P, and the combined efforts of the three droids allowed Tano to bring him to the medical bay. As the clones broke through the blast doors, Tano sealed even more doors to cover their escape.\n\nReaching the medical bay, Tano placed Rex on the medical bed. With Rex in position, Tano ordered R7 to run a scan for the inhibitor chip within Rex's brain; however, the initial scans came up empty prompting Tano to ask the medical droid to check again. As they scanned once more, CH-33P alerted Tano that the clones had begun to hack into the door and, with this, Tano ordered G-G to reseal the door as fast as possible if the clones managed to break through. Tano then asked R7 once more if anything had come up in the scans, but nothing had yet been located.\n\nWith this news, Tano walked over to Rex and put her hands around his head, beginning to chant \"I am one with the Force and the Force is with me.\" Continuing to chant, the unconscious Rex began to join in as the inhibitor chip was finally located. With its location finally having been discovered, Tano ordered R7 to remove the inhibitor chip to which R7 originally objected by asking if it would work, but Tano didn't know, only clarifying that if it didn't, the four of them were dead anyway. While they attempted to remove the inhibitor chip, the clones finally broke through the door, and Tano, in an effort to ward them off, reignited her lightsabers. As the clones began to fire upon Tano, she deflected their blaster bolts and used the Force to throw several of them while CH-33P attempted to reseal the door. As the clones began to overwhelm Tano, Rex woke up from his surgery and used his blasters to kill several clones as CH-33P finally resealed the door.\n\nWith Rex awake, Tano asked if he was alright. Rex assured her that he was and apologized for turning against and almost killing her earlier. With that, Tano asked how widespread the inhibitor chips were and how many Jedi were currently being betrayed across the galaxy, to which Rex responded with the crushing news that the entire Grand Army of the Republic had betrayed their Jedi and had been ordered to hunt down and kill the remaining ones. However, soon after, the clones began to cut through the door again as Tano and Rex turned to watch.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Order 66\n\nWith Rex now awake and on Tano's side, the two friends were ready to escape the Tribunal. Standing in front of the entrance as clones attempted to break through, Rex asked how Tano was planning on getting them out of the medical bay, to which she informed him that she had an idea. As Rex asked what her idea was, Tano instead asked Rex to set his blasters to stun as they were not attempting to kill any of them. As the clones continued cutting through the door, Rex informed Tano that they had almost finished cutting through, but Tano still told him to wait. As they finished cutting through, Tano used the Force to push the door out and knock several clones aside, making their escape easier. Briefly stunned, the three remaining troopers were easily knocked out by Rex; however, several more clones appeared from both sides as Tano rushed out of the med bay, lightsabers ignited, blocking each of their shots while Rex stunned all clones standing in their way.\n\nAs they fought the oncoming clones, Tano ordered R7 to find them a path off of the Star Destroyer. While doing so, R7 managed to close the blast doors around them, sealing off several oncoming troopers, allowing Rex and Tano to mop up the few remaining troopers. Now at a pause in the action, R7 informed Tano that all of the escape pods had been destroyed, leading Tano to conclude that taking a shuttle would be their best bet to escape. With this, Tano began to leave, but while she walked away Rex informed her that Maul had escaped his imprisonment, but Tano, having let him out herself, informed Rex upon this fact, to his surprise. He began to question her on why she would do such a thing, but she simply said that it was for a diversion as Tano began to rush for the hangar, asking Rex to hurry.\n\nAs they continued to run towards the hangar, the ship jolted as it exited hyperspace, having been stopped by Maul who had destroyed the hyperdrive using the Force, crippling it and causing it to be caught in the gravitational pull of a nearby moon. Finally arriving at the hangar's control center, Rex was the first to enter, stunning an unsuspecting officer shortly before Tano rushed in and used the Force to push one aside as Rex stunned the other two. As they reached the controls, Rex informed Tano that the clones had already locked everything down and that if they weren't trying to kill them, he would've been proud. As Rex said this, Tano ordered R7 to unlock the doors in Bay 12, CH-33P to prep the shuttle, and G-G to find out what had happened to the ship that had caused it to jolt. As G-G attempted to discover what happened, he informed the pair that the hyperdrive had been completely destroyed to Rex's disbelief. The two soon discovered that they had become entrenched in the gravitational field of a moon nearby. With this, Tano asked R7 to open the main hangar doors, and with that, they saw the oncoming moon, causing Tano to exclaim that they needed to get out of there. As the ship continued to jolt profusely, Rex asked about the status of the hangar doors as Tano asked about the shuttle. With that, R7 managed to open one of the hangar doors, revealing a shuttle for them; however, as R7 continued to open the rest of the hangar doors, it revealed an army of clone troopers, led by Jesse, waiting for them.\n\nAs the clones took their positions in the hangar, Rex quickly asked what they were going to do, but Tano admitted that there were too many clones standing in their path to make a break for the shuttle and that she didn't want to hurt any of them, leading Rex to tell her that the troops did not care about what she wanted. Continuing on, Rex told her that the Star Destroyer was going down and that all of the clones aboard were willing to die in order to kill them both. With that, Tano walked over to Rex and removed his helmet, revealing his distraught state. With this, Tano explained that Rex was a good soldier, but that every one of the clones trying to kill was too. Tano continued to state that they may be willing to die, but she wasn't willing to be the one to kill them, leading Rex to believe that she was admitting defeat.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Raada\n\nTano found herself on the remote agrarian moon of Raada in the Outer Rim. Tano landed the Fardi ship at the planet's main settlement. Under the alias of Ashla, Tano befriended a local girl named Kaeden Larte, who was part of a farming community. Kaeden allowed Tano to move into an abandoned home formerly owned by Cietra. Tano agreed to work as a mechanic, repairing droids and other machinery in return for ration packs. While adjusting to her new surroundings, Tano reminisced about her droid friend R2-D2 and having to hide her Force powers. The following day, Kaeden hired Tano to repair her thresher. While repairing the machinery, Tano learned more about Kaeden's life and work as a farmer and considered settling on the remote moon due to the lack of an Imperial presence. After repairing Kaeden's thresher, Tano explored the town and sighted several nearby hills and caves which she identified as a potential hiding place.\n\nOn her third day on Raada, Tano took the opportunity to explore the hills and caves ringing the settlement. She found a cave which she identified as her hiding place. Tano later met with Kaeden, her sister Miara Larte and several local friends including the farmer Tibbola, the work crew leader Vartan, and the twins Hoban and Neera at Selda's cantina, which had the best food in the settlement. The cantina was owned by the Togruta bartender Selda and run by the Sullustan woman Malat, who reminded Tano of Jedi Master Plo Koon. While socializing with her hosts, Tano learned that Kaeden and Miara were orphans who had lost their parents in an accident. Vartan had adopted the two girls. When Kaeden asked \"Ashla\" about her family, Tano claimed that she was adopted. When Selda asked Tano if she was part of the influx of aliens that had migrated out of the Core Worlds, Tano claimed that she was not running from anything but only longed for quiet. Selda advised her to talk to him or Vartan if she encountered any changes.\n\nAs time passed, Tano became the settlement's mechanic and repaired numerous broken threshers and other farming equipment. Kaeden and Miara came to regard \"Ashla\" as an adopted family member and regularly visited Tano to chat and deliver gifts including a door lock. Despite the friendship of the Larte sisters, Tano decided that she had grown bored with her new rustic, backwater adopted home. One free day, she packed up some supplies and went to meditate in the caves alone. Tano sensed a disturbance in the Force and witnessed the arrival of an Imperial Star Destroyer above the settlement. The Imperial official Jenneth Pilar had decided to exploit Raada as a source of crops for the Imperial Military. Despite initially panicking, Tano decided that the Empire had not come to hunt her.\n\nTano traveled to Selda's cantina and discussed the arrival of the Empire with Kaeden and her friends. Miara speculated that the Empire had come to explore the possibility of growing crops on Raada. The arrival of Imperial rule saw the introduction of new restrictive measures including night curfews, rules forbidding large group meetings, and restricting cantinas' operating hours, food, and alcohol. In response, Tano advised her friends to start stockpiling rations. While several Imperial personnel visited the cantina, Tano and her friends avoided contact with the Imperials by playing a game of crokin. When they inquired about Ahsoka's knowledge regarding their new situation, Tano decided not to reveal her past yet.\n\nThe following morning, Tano was visited by a pair of stormtroopers who asked why she was working. Tano informed them that her job was fixing broken machines, and so one of them asked for her information, saying that she may be reassigned to field if they deem it necessary. Wishing to maintain the freedom she had under her job repairing machines, Tano used a mind trick to convince the stormtroopers that her work was important for food production and they did not need to reassign her. With the pair in agreement with her, she asked if there was anything else she could help with and one reminded her of the new rules posted around the settlement. Tano closed the door on them and accumulated her rations to take to the caves. Being cautious of any surveillance that could be watching her, she made her way to the caves and hid the rations.\n\nWishing to move her freighter from the spaceport before the Empire locked it down, Tano scouted a place to hide it, discovering a gully where the starship could fit. She then headed to the spaceport to retrieve the freighter. There, an Imperial officer took list of the starships in the port. He asked Tano of her purpose there, to which she told him that she wished to move her ship. The officer tried to assure her that the local garrison would keep it safe, but she then began mocking the security, making her way past the haggled officer before he could continue to dispute.\n\nTano proceeded to the pilot's seat of the freighter and prepared for takeoff. The Imperial officer reattempted to argue but was muffled out by the engines as she flew the ship away. Tano flew her freighter the opposite way to the gully, taking it the long way around Raada to cover her tracks. Although she briefly considered abandoning the moon forever to run from the Empire, she chose to continue instead and hid her ship in the gully with its nose positioned upwards towards the sky to ensure a swift take off.\n\nLater, Tano met up with Kaeden, Miara, and number of other farmers at Selda's cantina. Neera informed Tano that Malat and her husband had already found work on the planet Sullust. Tano lied that her freighter had been stolen when Kaeden asked why she had not also decided to leave Raada. She and Miara then discussed the capabilities of the security lock the latter had created for her, with Vartan asking about making bigger charges. As Tano shut this down, Hoban argued that explosives would get rid of the Empire, to which the Togruta claimed would provoke reinforcements from the Empire, insisting that surviving with the Empire was a better strategy.\n\nTano then learned from Kaeden and Miara that the overseers were adding two hours to the farmers' shifts, with the Empire was planning on speeding up the crops and bringing their own seeds in. In this time, a number of uniformed Imperials entered the cantina. Tano then tabled the idea that the Empire was going to buy off the overseers and overwork the farmers, brushing off Neera's inquiry into her past. Hoban insisted in blowing up Imperials, but as Tano began arguing with him, a drunken Tibbola got into a scuffle with an Imperial officer. The Imperial officer overpowered Tibbola and let a stormtrooper shoot the farmer dead.\n\nAfter Vartan, Hoban and Neera left, Tano watched Kaeden play crokin and suggested that the safest way to hurt the Empire on Raada was for the farmers to begin working slower to slow the growth of their crops. Before Kaeden and Miara departed, Tano told them to relay the suggestion to Vartan, who presumably knew how to slow crop growth. Tano briefly spoke to Selda, who deduced that she had seen deaths like Tibbola's before and told her to be careful. The bartender then gave her some leftover food. Tano quickly walked home after.\n\nFor the next two weeks, Tano spent her days smuggling food, medical supplies, and water recyclers out to the caves. Tano was aided by the bartender Selda and several local vendors. In response to the slow growth of crops, thanks to the farmers, the new Imperial overseers extended the farmers' work shifts without increasing food rations, water, and breaks. Vartan discovered that the Empire was growing a new artificial crop on Raada that leached the planet's soils, preventing the farms from growing more crops. This fueled local resentment against the Empire since Raada had little arable land.\n\nIn a conversation about the artificial crops, Tano convinced Vartan to lend her Miara and Kaeden, whom she recruited for assembling bombs that were to be used to attack Imperial forces. Tano showed Kaeden her caves on a map and later handed the farmer and Miara food at those same caves. The sisters became questioned Tano's intentions in stockpiling at the caves so early on, but Tano dismissed it as habits and directed the conversation towards Kaeden and Miara's parents. Over the next several days, Vartan recruited forty farmers including Hoban into a resistance movement for Tano. He briefed the Togruta on the matter at Selda's cantina, displaying how the recruits were organized into crews. Before leaving, Tano told him that she would brief the farmers the next day and departed the cantina.\n\nLater, Tano led a mission to plant the corrosive charges on the Imperial walkers stored at the Raadian shipyard. For the mission she chose Miara, Neera and the Rodian Kolvin to accompany her; Miara to help set the charges, Neera for her swift thinking, and Kolvin for his nimbleness. Due to the weak stormtrooper security, Tano and her team infiltrated the spaceport easily. While planting charges, Tano took her time to observe the patrols, feeling that they would not be able to infiltrate the compound as easily after. After observing a couple patrol cycles passed, Neera advised the Togruta that it was time to leave.\n\nTano branched from the group with Miara to continue setting charges, and the Togruta was reminded of her time on Onderon during the Clone Wars. During their work, she also discovered that Miara had smuggled a real bomb, asking the girl of it. Miara tried to dismiss this as an accident, but the Togruta pressed her inquiry, asking if her companion had been plotting behind her back. The pair were briefly interrupted when another patrol passed, this time scanning the compound for a moment. After they passed, Tano and Miara continued their mission and soon reunited with Neera and Kolvin.\n\nAfter evading stormtrooper sentries, Tano and her team headed back to Selda's cantina. There, she discovered that Vartan had sent Hoban and Kaeden on an unsanctioned mission to attack the Imperial admin building. Since the uprising was premature, Tano urged the farmers to return home and to disavow any knowledge of what had happened that night to evade any arresting that could ensue. However, Miara refused to abandon her older sister. A reluctant Tano agreed to rescue Kaeden and the others but warned Miara to follow her orders and bring the explosives.\n\nTano ran through the streets with Miara and Neera towards the Imperial admin building when the alarms sounded from the Imperial compound, where the damage to the walkers had been discovered. As they continued to the compound, an explosion sounded and Miara denied that it was one of her bombs. When Tano told her two comrades to reveal the real plan, Neera revealed that Hoban had split the resistance fighters into three groups and that they were armed with explosives and blasters.\n\nTano ordered Miara to hide in the caves and Neera to bring the remaining resistance fighters to the caves. Tano decided to disable the Imperial tanks. When Miara asked \"Ashla\" what she was going to do, Tano responded that she would head to the thickest part of the fighting and evacuate as many people as she could. Tano also confided that she was a veteran of the Clone Wars when Miara asked again where she had come from. After separating from Miara, Tano and Neera headed to the Imperial compound, where Hoban's ill-equipped fighters had been repelled by the garrison's heavy artillery and the five remaining survivors including Hoban and Kaeden were pinned down by enemy fire.\n\nWhile Neera rounded up the surviving farmers, Tano planted explosives behind the Imperial tanks. These explosives immobilized the vehicles, halting the Imperial advance. Tano then took the opportunity to lead the five survivors to safety, knocking a stormtrooper to the ground and stealing the soldier's blaster. While fleeing the fighting, Tano and the farmers were blocked by a row of stormtroopers. Hoban surrendered but was gunned down by the troopers. Before these stormtroopers could execute the remaining survivors, though, Tano used the Force to fling the stormtroopers' blasters to the ground. Tano and the Raadian farmers then fled to the caves, with the former using the force to deflect artillery.\n\nAfter arriving in the caves, the resistance fighters turned to Tano and Kaeden told her that she had some explaining to do. With Neera being sedated to prevent her from harming herself, the farmers took some time to be quiet before Tano decided to reveal her identity as a former Jedi apprentice. Kaeden was angry with Tano for not revealing her Jedi identity since she could have saved Hoban's life and stormed off before the Togruta could continue explaining herself. Having been discovered by the Empire, Tano considered leaving to avoid drawing further attention from the Empire. While meditating, Tano was interrupted by Miara, who informed her that her sister Kaeden had left the caves and headed back to town. Tano instructed Miara to stay in the caves with Neera while she went to find Kaeden, knowing that the Imperials would catch her.\n\nMeanwhile, Kaeden returned to her home only to be captured by a stormtrooper patrol. Despite being tortured, the farmer refused to reveal Tano's name and the location of her fellow rebels. Tano, though, managed to infiltrate the Imperial admin building to retrieve Kaeden from her cell. Using one of Miara's corrosive explosives, the Togruta infiltrated the cell and carried the drugged farmer out of the high window using the Force, who told Tano that the Imperials wanted her very badly in a moment of consciousness. After escaping to the outskirts, Kaeden told Tano that the Imperial commander had taken an interest in her and advised her to leave offworld, thanking the Jedi for helping them. Tano promised that she would return, parting from the farmer shortly after.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Teth[]\n\nRex and his comrades were able to bring down an advancing Vulture droid starfighter, using it as cover to combat the droids at a closer proximity. Nevertheless, the clone troopers were seriously outnumbered, and the battle droids demanded their surrender. At that moment, Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived at Teth with Commander Cody, the 212th Attack Battalion, and an armada under the command of Wullf Yularen. Leading an aerial assault on the droids, Kenobi jumped out of his Delta-7B starfighter to assist Rex and the other Torrent Company survivors while LAAT/i gunships deployed Cody and his men. Learning from Rex that Skywalker was most likely still in the stronghold, Kenobi left to find his fellow Jedi General. Eventually, Skywalker\u2014having found and commandeered the Twilight, an old spice freighter, with Tano and Rotta\u2014contacted Rex, reluctantly telling him that they would be unable to give support since returning Rotta to his father on Tatooine was still their priority. Rex understood his general's dilemma and replied that he and his men would be able to hold out thanks to Kenobi's aid. Under covering fire from his men, Rex charged at an advancing dwarf spider droid and planted a primed thermal detonator on it, jumping away in time to avoid the explosion that engulfed it.\n\nAs Rex and his men cut through the battle droids, Kenobi returned from a duel with Ventress. Rex voiced his doubt that Skywalker and Tano would be able to reach Tatooine in their dilapidated freighter, but Kenobi was confident that Skywalker's expertise at a starship's controls would prove adequate. After the Republic finally emerged victorious on Teth, Rex conferred with Cody amidst the settling dust, venting his frustration with the poorly handled operation. Although Rex was still devastated with the loss of Torrent Company, his friend stated that their efforts had not been in vain, as Skywalker and Tano had reached Tatooine with Rotta. The two clone officers accompanied Masters Yoda and Kenobi to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine to retrieve Skywalker and Tano, who had returned Rotta to his father and established a treaty with the Hutts for Grand Army access through Hutt Space. Upon meeting with Rex, Skywalker and Tano wanted to hear all the details of the battle's end, of the men who had won and paid the ultimate price for the victory. Despite his distress, Rex agreed to recount it to them. Though Torrent Company was replenished with new troops, the defeat of the original unit stayed with Rex for a long time.",

The Imperial official Jenneth Pilar had decided to exploit Raada as a source of crops for the Imperial Military. Despite initially panicking, Tano decided that the Empire had not come to hunt her.\n\nTano traveled to Selda's cantina and discussed the arrival of the Empire with Kaeden and her friends. Miara speculated that the Empire had come to explore the possibility of growing crops on Raada. The arrival of Imperial rule saw the introduction of new restrictive measures including night curfews, rules forbidding large group meetings, and restricting cantinas' operating hours, food, and alcohol. In response, Tano advised her friends to start stockpiling rations. While several Imperial personnel visited the cantina, Tano and her friends avoided contact with the Imperials by playing a game of crokin. When they inquired about Ahsoka's knowledge regarding their new situation, Tano decided not to reveal her past yet.\n\nThe following morning, Tano was visited by a pair of stormtroopers who asked why she was working. Tano informed them that her job was fixing broken machines, and so one of them asked for her information, saying that she may be reassigned to field if they deem it necessary. Wishing to maintain the freedom she had under her job repairing machines, Tano used a mind trick to convince the stormtroopers that her work was important for food production and they did not need to reassign her. With the pair in agreement with her, she asked if there was anything else she could help with and one reminded her of the new rules posted around the settlement. Tano closed the door on them and accumulated her rations to take to the caves. Being cautious of any surveillance that could be watching her, she made her way to the caves and hid the rations.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Order 66\n\nAs Tano stared into hyperspace, she received a vision of Windu dueling Palpatine within his office and Skywalker betraying Windu, but did not fully understand what she was feeling. With this, Tano rushed into the command center and informed Rex that she believed something terrible had happened to Skywalker. However, instead, the clones began to turn their blasters towards her in accordance with Order 66. Joining them, Rex asked for them to lower their blasters so that he could kill her himself and raised his own blasters, a tear rolling down his face as he attempted to fight his inhibitor chip, an organic brain implant that compelled each clone trooper to comply with the directive.\n\nWhile his whole body shook and a tear rolled down his face, Rex asked for Tano to find Fives before firing upon her. Tano, forced to jump out of the way, ran towards Rex and tackled him, igniting her lightsabers to defend against the other clones' incoming blaster bolts, managing to kill both attacking her. She then closed the blast door as Rex began to stand up, rubbing his head from being forced into the command console. However, Jesse along with several other clones arrived, forcing Tano to divert her attention as all of the clones present began to fire upon her. With this, Tano attempted to direct the blaster bolts into the wiring above in an attempt to escape. As she escaped, the clones believed they had managed to kill her, but soon found that Tano had instead escaped into a vent above.\n\nExiting the vents, Tano made her way to the detention level in a bid to free Maul from capture in an attempt to create a diversion for herself. As she arrived, members of the Coruscant Guard were taking aim at Maul, ready to execute him, but she instead used the Force to push one aside and knocked the other one out by throwing him into the ceiling. With this, Tano looked towards Maul and told him not to make her regret her decision before she freed him from captivity. As Maul fell out of the vault, he expressed his surprise that she had survived, but instead of feeling flattered, Tano held her lightsaber to his throat and asked him if he was behind the clone's turning. Maul instead explained that he did not know exactly what had transpired, but instead said that he was sure Tano had felt the voices crying out in pain and death as Jedi across the galaxy were killed, including Tano's former mentor Plo Koon. Tano then explained that her clones had turned against her and she didn't know why to which Maul began to laugh and say that he had not known what Sidious' had been playing, but that he now did\u2014the Grand Army of the Republic had turned against the Jedi Order.\n\nHe then stood up and said that Tano had done the right thing in seeking his help and asked her to follow his lead, but Tano instead held her lightsaber up to him once more and made clear that she just wanted to use him as a diversion and not as a partner. With this, Tano ordered Maul to go cause some chaos as Maul looked at her with hatred displayed on his face. As the two walked out of the cell, Maul asked for one of Tano's lightsabers so that he might be granted a fighting chance, but Tano declined his offer and commanded him to leave once more. Now having freed Maul, Tano made her way to the droid storage room to recruit help from the droids located there.\n\nAs clones ran by, Tano snuck her way through the Venator, eventually arriving at her destination. Once Tano arrived in the droid storage room, she reactivated her old astromech droid R7-A7 who was ecstatic to see her, but Tano told him to quiet down as she required his help. R7 began to beep profusely, but Tano continued to attempt to quiet him down as the other two droids CH-33P and RG-G1 activated. As they activated, the droids began to profusely ask Tano questions upon what was happening, but Tano couldn't give them answers as she didn't know herself; however, she asked them for their help in discovering why. With this, the droids pledged their allegiance to her as Tano ordered them to get started.",

        "content": "# Rex - Redeployment[]\n\nRex and Skywalker soon returned to Coruscant, where Rex manned a blaster training range to maintain his troops' marksmanship skills. Just over a week after their return, word reached the Jedi High Council that General Grievous was targeting the planet Bothawui, home to the key Republic-affiliated Bothan Spynet. Skywalker was subsequently given command of his own battle group to defend the strategic world from the Confederacy. Kenobi, who was out of action due to being injured in a recent terrorist bombing, had Rex and the 501st Legion put on standby, knowing that Skywalker would want them for his strike force. After receiving his orders, Rex got his men settled on the Resolute, which was being prepared for Skywalker's fleet along with two other Venator-class Star Destroyers, the Pioneer and Dauntless. He enjoyed a brief reunion with Skywalker and Tano, who were pleased that he had been assigned to their task force. Once all was ready, they set off for the Both system, with Grievous and an armada of four Munificent-class star frigates pursuing them there. Although they beat Grievous to Bothawui, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano learned from Kenobi that Grievous had not abandoned his pursuit of them.\n\nAs Kenobi told them, Grievous was still on course to the Both system, having merely stopped to take on two additional frigates, which he had used to overwhelm Republic forces on the planet Falleen. Despite being outnumbered two-to-one in vessels, Skywalker was intent on protecting Bothawui and was unwilling to let it fall to the Confederacy. He deployed a detachment of AT-TE walkers under Rex's command to the asteroid belt surrounding the gas giant Bothawui Prime, from where they would be able to outflank Grievous once his fleet passed through the asteroids. After Grievous's frigates arrived in the system, proceeded through the asteroid belt\u2014as well as the AT-TEs hidden there\u2014and opened fire on the Republic Star Destroyers, Rex and his men turned the tide of the battle by attacking the frigates, targeting their aft sections. The ambush was all the more successful because the unsuspecting Grievous had diverted all of his frigates' power to their forward shields instead of their rear ones. The Resolute, Pioneer, and Dauntless annihilated the trapped Separatist armada but not before Grievous could flee from his command ship. Skywalker's Delta-7B starfighter took on damage while pursuing Grievous's personal starfighter, Soulless One, and veered off-course toward the asteroid belt.\n\nRex led a search-and-rescue mission into the asteroid belt; he managed to save Skywalker from his crippled starfighter but could not retrieve R2-D2, who had served as the Jedi General's astromech co-pilot. Rex and Tano met with Skywalker in the Resolute's medbay once he had regained consciousness and brought him up to date with the battle's success, albeit with the loss of R2-D2. After conducting an unsuccessful search for his astromech droid, Skywalker was forced to declare R2-D2 missing in action. Believing that the Resolute, Dauntless, and Pioneer could use modifications, Skywalker took his fleet back to the Allanteen Six shipyards, where they had been manufactured. Eventually, Kenobi contacted Skywalker and Tano and tasked them with finding a new Confederate listening post that was intercepting Grand Army transmissions. Departing from the shipyards on his new assignment, Skywalker elected to personally reconnoiter space suspected of Confederate activity while the rest of his forces concentrated on a more central path. Upon being informed of Skywalker's reconnaissance plan, Rex questioned whether he was sure about scouting ahead alone, but Skywalker was certain that more than one fighter would attract too much enemy attention.",

        "content": "# Rex - Further campaigns[]\n\nAs the war continued, Rex participated in a battle on a world against anti-Republic forces with Skywalker and Tano. During the fighting, Rex oversaw the operation of the Republic's AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons and had them return bombardment to the enemy artillery. Eventually, Skywalker learned that Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, a member of the ruling Separatist Council, had been arrested on the planet Rodia. While Tano departed to assist Jedi Master Luminara Unduli in transporting Gunray to Coruscant for trial, Skywalker and Rex stayed to maintain the Republic's position on the embattled world. When the Republic launched a later campaign to capture Confederate Head of State Count Dooku, Rex served with Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi aboard the Resolute, searching for traces of the Sith Lord in the hopes that removing him from the Confederate leadership would effect a quicker end to the war. Once they located Dooku's Munificent-class star frigate in the Vanqor system, Skywalker and Kenobi infiltrated the frigate to detain the Separatist leader while Rex, remaining behind with Tano, took Wullf Yularen's place of commanding the Resolute, as the admiral was recovering from the previous run-in with the Malevolence.\n\nAs soon as Skywalker and Kenobi were aboard Dooku's frigate, Rex had the Resolute move into position and open fire, crippling the enemy vessel. However, Dooku escaped aboard his solar sailer, and Skywalker and Kenobi gave pursuit in a stolen Sheathipede-class transport shuttle, ordering Rex and Tano to follow in any available craft. Although Skywalker and Kenobi crash-landed on the planet Vanqor alongside Dooku, a band of pirates brought the Sith Lord to their base on Florrum. After Tano retrieved Skywalker and Kenobi from Vanqor, Rex was present on the Resolute's bridge when Masters Yoda and Mace Windu of the Jedi Council delivered new orders to them. Hondo Ohnaka, the leader of the pirate gang that had captured Dooku, had issued a ransom of a million credits for their prisoner, and Skywalker and Kenobi were to verify that the Florrum pirates had custody of Dooku so that the Republic could pay the ransom. Yet Ohnaka's pirates also briefly captured Skywalker and Kenobi, who failed to prevent Dooku from escaping from Florrum.\n\nWhile liberating the planet Queel from the Confederacy alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and Tano, Rex accompanied the latter to eliminate the enemy's artillery encampment. Rex used a jetpack to cross a swamp to the artillery base, while Tano rode a large dragon-like creature. Attacking the battle droids guarding the blaster cannons, Tano threw a blaster battery at the artillery stations with the Force, and Rex detonated the explosive by shooting the flying target, annihilating the cannons. He and Tano then returned to the Republic's forward command post with Skywalker and Kenobi to receive an incoming message from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In a conference with Jedi Masters Yoda and Ki-Adi-Mundi, Skywalker and Tano were assigned to intercept the Separatist agent Messo\u2014who had stolen a Republic data file\u2014in the Mon Gazza system, while Kenobi was to finish the campaign on Queel. Rex went with Skywalker and Tano aboard the Twilight to undertake their assignment on the planet Mon Gazza, where Skywalker left to find Messo while Rex and Tano stayed behind to secure the freighter. After changing out of his usual armor, Rex donned a heavily covered-up disguise and traveled with Tano to find her Master. When Skywalker confronted Messo in a Podracing arena, he discovered that the enemy agent had already transferred the data file. To further complicate matters, Messo was killed in a collision with a Podracer before he could reveal any more information.\n\nRex and Tano joined Skywalker in the stands to watch the race and learned that Skywalker, who believed that Messo's contact belonged to one of the teams in the racing circuit, had entered Tano as a contestant to go undercover with the other racers. They proceeded to the Podracing stalls to begin outfitting Tano's Podracer, with Rex, Skywalker, and R2-D2 posing as her pit crew. The skilled Podracer Kidd Kareen became their prime suspect for being Messo's correspondent, as Tano learned via Jedi intelligence that several recent espionage incidents had coincided with the racing circuit's presence in the same system, with Kareen and his crew being present for each of the events. Once Kareen's crew had left their stall for the day, Tano kept Kareen occupied while Skywalker took a look around the stall, with Rex and R2-D2 on lookout. However, Kareen's fellow crew member San Maxus caught Skywalker snooping around, and a fistfight erupted between the Jedi and Kareen's crew. Shortly after Rex joined the fray, Tano and Kareen returned and halted the fight, and Tano was forced to apologize for her crew's actions. Rex and his comrades hurriedly left to prepare when they learned that the Padawan's debut race was next.\n\nAt the race, Rex and Skywalker tracked Tano's progress through the course via R2-D2's hololink, rushing to her aid when another Podracer rammed her from behind near the finish line. Although Tano's Podracer had been demolished in the crash, Kareen offered to loan her one of his spare Podracers. Rex and Skywalker later trailed Maxus into a pub and used R2-D2 to eavesdrop on him. They discovered that Maxus was the Separatist spy when he contacted Count Dooku, and they also overheard Dooku arranging to have another agent collect the stolen Republic datachip from Maxus the next day. That day, during Tano's next race alongside Kareen and Maxus, Rex and Skywalker noticed Maxus recovering the stolen datachip from the Podracing pits and chased after him. Though Maxus escaped, he left the rest of Kareen's crew to engage them in blaster combat. While Rex and R2-D2 fought off the Podracers, Skywalker departed to help his Padawan, and the Jedi managed to prevent Maxus from handing over the datachip to Asajj Ventress thanks to assistance from Kareen. With their task completed, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano bid farewell to Kareen before leaving Mon Gazza aboard the Twilight. The three reported their success to Kenobi, who was still on Queel.\n\nWhen rumors abounded of a new Confederate project in the Outer Rim, Rex became involved with sending Denal on various missions to counter the menace. While Denal was on Rodia investigating the rumors, Rex contacted him and ordered him to make way for Republic reinforcements by purging a nearby jungle clearing of battle droids. Once Denal had done so, Rex sent him to destroy a transport factory by activating its self-destruct mechanism. At Rex's behest, Denal next took a squad to Tatooine to scout out an allegedly deserted Separatist base, which was discovered to be teeming with droid forces. After Denal's team cleared the outpost of hostiles, Rex relayed the news that another enemy base\u2014this time a research station\u2014had been discovered on Tatooine. As the outpost was reportedly connected to the new Separatist project, Rex told Denal to act quickly before the facility could be evacuated and any evidence destroyed. Denal infiltrated the station and uncovered plans for a superweapon that could cloak entire armies from the Republic. He later destroyed the superweapon at its construction site on the ice world Orto Plutonia. Shortly after Denal returned to the Republic fleet and received commendations from Kenobi, Rex dispatched the trooper on yet another assignment.\n\nRex was sent with Skywalker and Tano to the planet Taronda to secure raw materials that the Republic desperately needed. However, Taronda's resources were also of interest to the Separatists, who targeted a mining settlement on the world to divert the Republic's attention. With Vulture droid starfighters attacking from overhead, Skywalker had Rex gather the miners and prepare the encampment's deflector shield. Though Tano fell down a crevice leading to a mineshaft, Rex informed Skywalker of a more pressing matter: the arrival of a Separatist assault force composed of a C-9979 troopship, Multi-Troop Transports, and multiple Armored Assault Tanks. After bringing the wounded civilians to safety, Rex triggered the shield and called in Republic reinforcements. Asajj Ventress materialized just beyond the shield and revealed that she had sent dwarf spider droids after Tano, but Rex told Skywalker to have faith in his Padawan and restrained him from confronting Ventress. She withdrew her droid forces from Taronda upon discovering that a Republic Star Destroyer was inbound. Rex thereafter deemed it safe to disable the shield, and Tano, who had defeated the spider droids on her own, soon rejoined him and Skywalker.\n\nWhen the Republic Ninth Fleet received a distress call from the Deyvus, a malfunctioning merchant starship locked on course with an unstable nebula, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano were sent to rescue the ship aboard the Twilight, as their craft was the nearest and fastest one available. On approach to the Deyvus, Rex noted that the damage appeared to be severe, with its ion drive gone critical and it's stabilizers offline. As they prepared to send R2-D2 to access the Deyvus's maintenance systems, the vessel revealed a number of battle droid\u2013manned laser cannons, leading Rex, Skywalker, and Tano to realize that it was a Separatist trap. Before they could maneuver the Twilight out of range, the droids targeted its engines; Rex used a fire extinguisher to put out the accompanying flames in the cockpit. He informed Skywalker that another impact would cripple the Twilight, as its hull could not withstand further damage. While the Twilight began to be pulled toward the collapsing nebula, General Grievous holographically contacted Rex, Skywalker, and Tano and lured them aboard the Deyvus, from where he claimed to be watching their deaths. Skywalker had R2-D2 begin repairing the Twilight's engines and took Rex with him to the Deyvus to capture Grievous.\n\nRex and Skywalker used a pair of grappling hooks to pull themselves toward the Deyvus through the void of space. Along the way, Rex questioned the boldness of their plan, to which Skywalker replied that it was boldness that distinguished them from the Separatists. Sneaking past the heavy laser cannons, Rex and Skywalker boarded the gun deck and proceeded into the Deyvus's system of hallways. Before they could get far, B1 battle droids and shielded droidekas surrounded them. Skywalker responded by slicing a hole in an adjacent wall with his lightsaber to blaze a detour to the bridge, where they assumed Grievous was sequestered. They passed through three floors, eliminating all of the battle droids in their path. On the bridge, they discovered that Grievous was not aboard the Deyvus; instead, a plethora of primed thermal detonators greeted them. Grievous contacted them from the safety of a Separatist cruiser and taunted their predictability before severing the connection. Skywalker quickly cut intersecting slices in the cockpit's roof with his lightsaber, and Rex blasted a hole through the weakened metal, allowing them to return to the Twilight moments before the Deyvus exploded. Though they failed to capture Grievous, they had foiled his trap for them.\n\nEventually, the Jedi Order learned\u2014via a datachip that Ros Lai, an outcast of the Nightsisters clan of Dathomir, had provided\u2014that the Confederacy had entered into an alliance with the Nightsisters. Rex returned to Christophsis with Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, her protocol droid C-3PO, and R2-D2 to pursue Lai's leads about the new enemy partnership for the Jedi High Council. During their investigations, Amidala discovered that the Separatist Droid Army was mining for something on Christophsis, though she was unable to determine what. Amidala reported her findings to the High Council and prepared to leave Christophsis with Rex and her droids. Before they could get off-world, enemy forces shot down their ship, and Rex was injured in the subsequent crash. He, Amidala, C-3PO, and R2-D2 were imprisoned in the Separatist base, where the battle droids were conducting their mining operation. While there, they overheard their guards saying that the Confederacy was harvesting crystals from the planet core, which were to be used to power the Devastation, a newly constructed warship and the sister ship of the Malevolence.\n\nSkywalker and Kenobi\u2014who had been sent with Clone Commander CC-1004, nicknamed \"Gree,\" to rescue Amidala\u2014soon freed Rex and his friends from their prison cell. While C-3PO and R2-D2 remained behind to assist in the Jedi's continuing investigation, Amidala helped Rex to Gree's LAAT/i gunship, which had a medical console on standby for him. The Jedi later destroyed the Devastation before it could assault Coruscant, killing the Nightsister leader, Sai Sircu, and terminating her alliance with Dooku and the Confederacy.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Life on Thabeska\n\nAhsoka Tano fled into the Outer Rim, intent on hiding from the Empire. Eventually, she found the planet Thabeska, a planet that dealt largely in small-scale water and technology trading, and one with a relatively small and unorganized population located far away from major hyperspace routes. Believing the rural world to be of little interest to the Empire, and a steady stream of newcomers would allow herself to blend into the quiet world, Tano made landing on Thabeska. However, the refugee did not account for the presence of the local Fardi clan, an influential family that either touched or ran most of Thabeska's businesses, including their own smuggling operations, though the family fronted such with several legal businesses. In time, Tano came to hear rumors that some kind of dark lord who was serving the Emperor and hunting Jedi, yet she was unable to confirm such reports.\n\nIn order to hide her identity, Tano took on the name \"Ashla,\" which was also the name of a moon that orbited the scared Jedi world of Tython, another term for the light side of the Force, and the name of a Jedi youngling from the Clone Wars-era. Upon arrival on Thabeska, Tano was greeted by several young girls. They showed her where she could find food and a place to stay, and introduced her to Fardi, who bought Ashla's ship for what she thought was a nearly decent price. Nevertheless, Fardi did not inquire the reason for Ashla's arrival at the dawn of the Empire, and the girls, who Ashla realized to be Fardi's daughters and nieces, took the Togruta arrival under their wing. Followed ceaselessly by the young Fardi sisters, Ashla soon found herself working for the Fardi family once they learned that she was a good mechanic, and the refugee was given her own room in the Fardi compound and paid fair amounts of money for her work. Ashla had secured her place in the Fardi clan, becoming a friend amongst the Fardi girls.\n\nTwo months before Empire Day, the first anniversary of Emperor Palpatine's rise to power, Ahsoka Tano was working on some droids in the shipyard on Thabeska when she noticed some of the Fardi children playing by a stack of crates. As Tano observed, the crates began to fall onto the children who cried out of fear, forcing Tano to save the Fardis by levitating the crates through the Force. Tano had kept her Jedi powers a secret since leaving Mandalore, and feared that she had revealed herself to the young Fardis. Ashla reminded them that they should not have been playing near the crates, and they begged her not to tell Fardi, giving up their sweets\u2014their only form of currency\u2014and ignoring the supernatural incident they had just witnessed. Only Hedala Fardi, the youngest of her family, looked at Ashla with fascination. Sometime later, the Togruta outlander discovered that Hedala Fardi was Force-sensitive, as the Fardi youngling lifted several small stones with subtle hand gestures before the eyes of Ahsoka Tano.\n\nOn Empire Day, Tano was informed by the Fardi girls that their father was having important Imperial guests over for dinner and that they wanted to meet anyone who was new to the planet. The girls offered for Tano to come and sit with them at the Empire Day parade and flyby, and told her about how security was a disaster due to the high amount of ships in the shipyard.\n\nTano took this invitation as a subtle warning and opportunity to escape the planet, and Tano used this opportunity to her advantage. She gathered the belongings she had and escaped through the city streets for the landing field.\n\nAfter numerous run-ins with Imperial stormtroopers, Ahsoka Tano was forced to steal one of Fardi's ships, leaving the planet. Once in orbit, Tano remembered Hedala Fardi and the danger that she was in, being a Force-sensitive child who would likely be sought out by the Empire, but Tano knew that she was too late, so she left.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Mission to JanFathal[]\n\nAt least six months into the war, Rex agreed to relieve Skywalker of his Padawan for a few days by taking her along on a three-day shakedown cruise aboard Republic Navy Captain Gilad Pellaeon's newly refitted assault ship, Leveler, in the Dantus sector. After Pellaeon, an old acquaintance of his, permitted him to take part in Leveler's testing session, Rex departed to join the cruise with Tano, Sergeant Coric, and six clone troopers new to Torrent Company\u2014Ross, Boro, Joc, Hil, Vere, and Ince, who had completed their training several days prior. En route to Leveler aboard a shuttle, Tano questioned if her Master had taken a respite from training just for a break from her, but Rex abstained from directly answering to avoid speculating about Skywalker. He was more concerned about his new troops: He was considering using the inconsiderate tally sensor to tell the six apart because they had so far failed to display unique personalities. After Rex and his men arrived aboard Leveler, Pellaeon greeted them and allowed them to move into their barracks. At Tano's request, Rex took her to examine Leveler's experimental concussion missiles, and Pellaeon joined them at one of the missile bays.\n\nRex and Pellaeon were cut off from a discussion about Leveler's new weapons by an alert that a flotilla of Confederate ships had exited hyperspace in the nearby Fath sector. While Rex and Pellaeon monitored the Separatist activity, Tano sensed a disturbance in the Force that, at Rex's advice, Pellaeon took seriously. Despite the possibility that the enemy activity would not result in anything, Rex took precautions and went to round up his men in case they were needed. After Rex returned to Torrent Company's barracks and relayed the situation, Joc's inquiries into Pellaeon's private life sparked a debate between Tano and the rookie clones about the Jedi Code's ban on emotional attachment. Rex ended the argument by putting his men on standby, while Tano departed to check out the ops room at his suggestion. Once she had left, Rex reproved his men for putting her on the spot but was also pleased that they were settling in and expressing themselves. In an effort to keep them occupied, he took his men to the hangar deck to perform some deck circuits and familiarize themselves with the Fath system, where Leveler was headed to keep a closer eye on the active Separatist armada.\n\nRex contacted Skywalker to inform him of their diversion to the Fath system, and Skywalker responded by setting off to rendezvous with Leveler despite his captain's admission that his involvement was unnecessary. After taking a moment to shave his hair from a blue-dyed haircut\u2014in support of the Sullustan Bylluran Athletic bolo-ball team\u2014Rex joined Tano and Pellaeon on the bridge just as the warship became host to the Altisian Jedi sect. Jedi Master Djinn Altis, who spoke for the group, asked for permission to dock his freighter, Wookiee Gunner, on the grounds of receiving a distress signal from a Republic agent on the nearby planet JanFathal. Republic Intelligence confirmed Altis's story and reported that the agent had been captured during a Separatist-allied rebel uprising. Pellaeon approved the rendezvous with Altis, and Rex promised his men for the hostage extraction that they would soon be performing. However, matters were complicated when the captive operative was identified as Hallena Devis, a close acquaintance of Pellaeon. While Rex and his men were examining JanFathal's capital of Athar\u2014where Devis was being held\u2014via a holochart in Leveler's meeting room, Altis and fellow Jedi Callista Masana and Geith Eris convened with them, Pellaeon, and Tano to formulate a plan to rescue Devis.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Raada\n\nWishing to move her freighter from the spaceport before the Empire locked it down, Tano scouted a place to hide it, discovering a gully where the starship could fit. She then headed to the spaceport to retrieve the freighter. There, an Imperial officer took list of the starships in the port. He asked Tano of her purpose there, to which she told him that she wished to move her ship. The officer tried to assure her that the local garrison would keep it safe, but she then began mocking the security, making her way past the haggled officer before he could continue to dispute.\n\nTano proceeded to the pilot's seat of the freighter and prepared for takeoff. The Imperial officer reattempted to argue but was muffled out by the engines as she flew the ship away. Tano flew her freighter the opposite way to the gully, taking it the long way around Raada to cover her tracks. Although she briefly considered abandoning the moon forever to run from the Empire, she chose to continue instead and hid her ship in the gully with its nose positioned upwards towards the sky to ensure a swift take off.\n\nLater, Tano met up with Kaeden, Miara, and number of other farmers at Selda's cantina. Neera informed Tano that Malat and her husband had already found work on the planet Sullust. Tano lied that her freighter had been stolen when Kaeden asked why she had not also decided to leave Raada. She and Miara then discussed the capabilities of the security lock the latter had created for her, with Vartan asking about making bigger charges. As Tano shut this down, Hoban argued that explosives would get rid of the Empire, to which the Togruta claimed would provoke reinforcements from the Empire, insisting that surviving with the Empire was a better strategy.\n\nTano then learned from Kaeden and Miara that the overseers were adding two hours to the farmers' shifts, with the Empire was planning on speeding up the crops and bringing their own seeds in. In this time, a number of uniformed Imperials entered the cantina. Tano then tabled the idea that the Empire was going to buy off the overseers and overwork the farmers, brushing off Neera's inquiry into her past. Hoban insisted in blowing up Imperials, but as Tano began arguing with him, a drunken Tibbola got into a scuffle with an Imperial officer. The Imperial officer overpowered Tibbola and let a stormtrooper shoot the farmer dead.\n\nAfter Vartan, Hoban and Neera left, Tano watched Kaeden play crokin and suggested that the safest way to hurt the Empire on Raada was for the farmers to begin working slower to slow the growth of their crops. Before Kaeden and Miara departed, Tano told them to relay the suggestion to Vartan, who presumably knew how to slow crop growth. Tano briefly spoke to Selda, who deduced that she had seen deaths like Tibbola's before and told her to be careful. The bartender then gave her some leftover food. Tano quickly walked home after.\n\nFor the next two weeks, Tano spent her days smuggling food, medical supplies, and water recyclers out to the caves. Tano was aided by the bartender Selda and several local vendors. In response to the slow growth of crops, thanks to the farmers, the new Imperial overseers extended the farmers' work shifts without increasing food rations, water, and breaks. Vartan discovered that the Empire was growing a new artificial crop on Raada that leached the planet's soils, preventing the farms from growing more crops. This fueled local resentment against the Empire since Raada had little arable land.\n\nIn a conversation about the artificial crops, Tano convinced Vartan to lend her Miara and Kaeden, whom she recruited for assembling bombs that were to be used to attack Imperial forces. Tano showed Kaeden her caves on a map and later handed the farmer and Miara food at those same caves. The sisters became questioned Tano's intentions in stockpiling at the caves so early on, but Tano dismissed it as habits and directed the conversation towards Kaeden and Miara's parents. Over the next several days, Vartan recruited forty farmers including Hoban into a resistance movement for Tano. He briefed the Togruta on the matter at Selda's cantina, displaying how the recruits were organized into crews. Before leaving, Tano told him that she would brief the farmers the next day and departed the cantina.",

        "content": "# Rex - Further campaigns[]\n\nAs the war continued, Rex participated in a battle on a world against anti-Republic forces with Skywalker and Tano. During the fighting, Rex oversaw the operation of the Republic's AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons and had them return bombardment to the enemy artillery. Eventually, Skywalker learned that Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, a member of the ruling Separatist Council, had been arrested on the planet Rodia. While Tano departed to assist Jedi Master Luminara Unduli in transporting Gunray to Coruscant for trial, Skywalker and Rex stayed to maintain the Republic's position on the embattled world. When the Republic launched a later campaign to capture Confederate Head of State Count Dooku, Rex served with Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi aboard the Resolute, searching for traces of the Sith Lord in the hopes that removing him from the Confederate leadership would effect a quicker end to the war. Once they located Dooku's Munificent-class star frigate in the Vanqor system, Skywalker and Kenobi infiltrated the frigate to detain the Separatist leader while Rex, remaining behind with Tano, took Wullf Yularen's place of commanding the Resolute, as the admiral was recovering from the previous run-in with the Malevolence.\n\nAs soon as Skywalker and Kenobi were aboard Dooku's frigate, Rex had the Resolute move into position and open fire, crippling the enemy vessel. However, Dooku escaped aboard his solar sailer, and Skywalker and Kenobi gave pursuit in a stolen Sheathipede-class transport shuttle, ordering Rex and Tano to follow in any available craft. Although Skywalker and Kenobi crash-landed on the planet Vanqor alongside Dooku, a band of pirates brought the Sith Lord to their base on Florrum. After Tano retrieved Skywalker and Kenobi from Vanqor, Rex was present on the Resolute's bridge when Masters Yoda and Mace Windu of the Jedi Council delivered new orders to them. Hondo Ohnaka, the leader of the pirate gang that had captured Dooku, had issued a ransom of a million credits for their prisoner, and Skywalker and Kenobi were to verify that the Florrum pirates had custody of Dooku so that the Republic could pay the ransom. Yet Ohnaka's pirates also briefly captured Skywalker and Kenobi, who failed to prevent Dooku from escaping from Florrum.\n\nWhile liberating the planet Queel from the Confederacy alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and Tano, Rex accompanied the latter to eliminate the enemy's artillery encampment. Rex used a jetpack to cross a swamp to the artillery base, while Tano rode a large dragon-like creature. Attacking the battle droids guarding the blaster cannons, Tano threw a blaster battery at the artillery stations with the Force, and Rex detonated the explosive by shooting the flying target, annihilating the cannons. He and Tano then returned to the Republic's forward command post with Skywalker and Kenobi to receive an incoming message from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In a conference with Jedi Masters Yoda and Ki-Adi-Mundi, Skywalker and Tano were assigned to intercept the Separatist agent Messo\u2014who had stolen a Republic data file\u2014in the Mon Gazza system, while Kenobi was to finish the campaign on Queel. Rex went with Skywalker and Tano aboard the Twilight to undertake their assignment on the planet Mon Gazza, where Skywalker left to find Messo while Rex and Tano stayed behind to secure the freighter. After changing out of his usual armor, Rex donned a heavily covered-up disguise and traveled with Tano to find her Master. When Skywalker confronted Messo in a Podracing arena, he discovered that the enemy agent had already transferred the data file. To further complicate matters, Messo was killed in a collision with a Podracer before he could reveal any more information.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Siege of Mandalore\n\nAfter being dropped off by a gunship, Tano ventured into the Undercity and was met by Vaughn, who informed her that they had engaged Saxon, but he escaped into an access tunnel, seeming to be in a hurry. Tano asked what was down there and Vaughn told her that it was a series of mainly sewer tunnels and conduit access points, but he didn't know if it led outside of the city. Tano then ordered the clones to move in to investigate where the tunnels led.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, they were walking into a trap as another leader of the super commandos, Rook Kast, was prepping her super commandos to ambush Tano and her forces. As they continued to explore, Kast emerged from hiding and fired an explosive at them, forcing Tano to use the Force to divert the explosive on an alternate path. However, it still exploded near them, knocking Tano to the ground and briefly disorienting her and her forces. As Tano recovered herself, Vaughn and the rest of the clones chased after Kast and her super commandos, ignoring Tano's cries for them to wait. As Tano followed the trail of bodies, she was led to an opening in the Undercity where Vaughn apologized for his actions, dying while she held his hand.\n\nShortly thereafter, the super commandos rushed in and surrounded Tano who ignited her lightsabers to defend herself as Maul similarly emerged from hiding. Upon his emergence, Maul explained that he had been hoping for Kenobi to show up instead of Tano and asked her why she was here instead. Tano then looked around at her opponents and readjusted her stand, turning her head back to Maul. Maul proceeded explained that he did not know who Tano was to which she said that she knew who he was. Maul went on to say that he assumed that they both mutually knew several people.\n\nAs Maul spoke, Tano pressed a button on her wrist comm, informing Rex that she needed assistance. While Rex traced her signal, Maul explained that he was certain Kenobi would've come instead of sending Tano to which she explained that he was needed at the Battle of Coruscant as opposed to fighting Maul. Maul then began to wonder if Sidious' plan was finally coming to fruition, but did not explain as much to Tano. Maul then asked why he sent Tano to which she taunted Maul by asking him to surrender so that they could both go and ask Kenobi themselves. However, Maul explained that that would be pointless as he believed the Jedi and the Republic would soon be toppled by Darth Sidious.\n\nHowever, before they could finish talking, Rex and several other clones arrived, attacking two super commandos from behind as Maul ignited his lightsaber and attacked Tano who just barely managed to defend herself in time. However, after they very briefly fought, Maul declared that it was not time for their true confrontation to take place and pushed Tano back. Before she could recover, Maul picked Rex up with the Force and tossed him into her. Maul, Kast, and one other super commando then escaped to which Tano ordered her men to chase after them as she recovered and chased after him herself. As they split up, Tano chased after what she thought was Maul, but after attempting to take a shortcut, ran into Rex instead, losing Maul. Knowing they had failed, Tano declared that they had lost him.\n\nAfter Maul's escape, Tano met with a hologram of Kenobi along with Rex in the Grand Salon of the Sundari Royal Palace while overlooking a hologram of Sundari itself. During their conference, Kryze walked over and informed the group that firefights were still occurring in Sector 11 and congratulated the clones on how effective they had performed in the siege; however, she also noted that Maul still needed to be in custody by the end of it or the entire siege would've been for nothing. With this, Tano noted that while she was in the Undercity, Maul mentioned the name of Darth Sidious to which Kryze asked Kenobi who he was, but Kenobi could share very little information on him, only being able to tell them what the Jedi Council suspected.",

As Maul shattered the glass on the dome of the city in an attempt to escape, Tano chased after him, jumping up and knocking him off of where he stood. As the two regained their balance once more, their duel continued. However, Maul soon managed to knock one of Tano's lightsabers free from her hand, causing it to tumble down to the fighting below. As she attempted to fight with only one of her sabers, Maul managed to easily disarm her of her second saber. Having gained the upper hand, Maul sliced the support beam the two were standing on, causing it to sag. Tano remained in a fighting position, ready for Maul to attack her once more. As Maul jumped onto her sagging support beam, he gave her one last chance to join him, which she refused leading to Maul continuing his attack, but being stopped when Tano managed to grab hold of his lightsaber and throw him off of the beam. She then stopped him from falling by using the Force as Maul cried out for Tano to let him die.\n\nAs gunships arrived to extract him, Maul wailed in terror of what was to come, claiming they were all going to die before one of the Mandalorians used the whipcord within his vambrace and entangled Maul within it, allowing Rex to stun him.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Siege of Mandalore\n\nArriving at Mandalore, Tano boarded a gunship alongside Kryze, Rex, and ARC trooper CT-5597 \"Jesse\" and joined the assault team in their approach to Sundari. During their approach, Prime Minister Almec contacted them and questioned them on why the Republic was attacking Mandalore, but after Kryze announced her presence to Almec, declaring their knowledge of him being a puppet of Maul, Almec understood. As he informed her that this attack would make her an enemy to the citizens of Sundari, she ended the transmission, noting that she didn't care. Tano turned to address Kryze and commented on how much of a difference there was between her and her sister, Satine. Kryze then contacted Ursa Wren, another one of the Nite Owls, and asked her if she could confirm where Maul was located, but Wren was only able to confirm that he had not yet left the city and also informed them that Maul's forces were preparing for combat.\n\nAs she ended the transmission with Wren, their gunship began to violently shake as Maul's forces had arrived and had begun their attack. They opened the gunship's doors to see the carnage ensuing outside as a gunship was destroyed next to them, forcing Tano to shield herself from the oncoming debris. Shortly afterwards, everyone aboard their respective gunships left to engage the enemy in the air using their jetpacks. Rex apologized for not bringing Tano one, however, Tano instead smiled and informed him that she didn't one, declaring a race to the surface between the two.\n\nJumping out of their gunship, Tano ignited both of her lightsabers and landed on another gunship, destroying both of the attacking super commandos' jetpacks with her lightsabers. Noticing more super commandos inside another gunship, she jumped down onto it, destroying one of their jetpacks before jumping inside the gunship and kicking two of the others. She then sliced the blasters off two other super commandos before kicking one and pushing another into the side of the gunship with the Force. Before leaving, she kicked one of the last super commandos aboard before destroying the last super commando's jetpack, allowing her to hitch a ride as it sputtered out before landing on a Kom'rk-class fighter/transport.\n\nWhile running across the fighter, Tano noticed a crashing gunship. Landing atop it, she noticed the pilot's ejector seat had failed and needed assistance escaping the gunship. In order to do this, she used her lightsabers to cut the top off of the cockpit, allowing the pilot's ejector seat to launch as the pilot thanked her. Before the gunship crashed, she hitched a short ride as the super commandos on the surface prepared to fire at her. Jumping down onto a platform, the gunship exploded behind her as the super commandos began to fire at her, forcing her to deflect their blaster bolts, allowing her to kill several of them. As she continued to defend herself, Wren and many other Mandalorians arrived alongside Rex. With Rex's arrival, Tano mentioned that she had beaten him to the surface, reminding Rex that some things never changed. The two friends then rushed into Sundari.\n\nShortly afterward, Gar Saxon, one of the leaders of the super commandos, escaped into the Undercity of Sundari, taking several super commandos along with him. Watching the fighting occurring in the city atop a balcony, Tano watched as Rex returned from his scouting mission and confirmed to them that Maul had not yet been found. With this news, Kryze informed them that she and her Mandalorians would be heading to the Sundari Royal Palace to capture Almec and ordered her to find Maul as they would not be able to sustain a long siege. After Kryze left, Tano ordered Rex to support Wren at Sundari's docks in order to ensure Maul didn't escape. Before he left, Rex informed Tano that if Maul wasn't in Sundari then the entire siege would be playing into his plans. Just then, Clone Captain CT-0292 \"Vaughn\" contacted Rex, informing him that they had a lead on Maul's location as Tano and Rex rushed off to go investigate the situation.",

        "content": "# Rex - Shipyards of Gwori[]\n\nAs warfare continued to devastate the galaxy, the Confederate Navy, outnumbering the Republic Navy fourfold, put the Republic's war effort at a supreme disadvantage. With the likelihood of being prematurely defeated in the war, the Jedi High Council decided to impair Separatist starship production by targeting the InterGalactic Banking Clan's Confederate-allied Gwori shipyards. Because the shipyards' exact location on Gwori's planetary surface had yet to be determined, the task of pinpointing it fell to Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi. To penetrate Gwori's defenses\u2014namely, a droid-operated blockade and a radiation beam that eradicated all life forms bound for the planet\u2014Skywalker chalked out a plan for a small strike force to be temporarily frozen in carbonite. R2-D2, whose presence would not cause much suspicion to the blockade's droid security, would then pilot the team to Gwori. After locating the shipyards, they would relay the coordinates to Generals Plo Koon and Saesee Tiin, who would eliminate the facility with a Republic squadron. Initiating preparations on Coruscant, Rex gathered a clone squad at carbonite freezing plant CT-642, where Skywalker assured his captain that they would not be frozen long enough for hibernation sickness to take effect. Rex and his men, along with Skywalker and Kenobi, were encased in carbonite with the addition of Tano, who had been ordered not to participate in the mission but nonetheless manipulated Admiral Yularen to grant her clearance.\n\nRex and the strike team proceeded to Gwori aboard the freighter VX-391, with R2-D2 at the controls. When the blockade's battle droids discovered that the ship was unregistered, R2-D2 was forced to release the task force and jettison from the vessel just before the battle droids shot down the freighter. The astromech droid freed Tano from her carbonite slab, and she in turn released Rex and the others. Once they had found the enemy facility, Skywalker and Kenobi sent Rex, Tano, R2-D2, and two other clone troopers to contact Koon and Tiin from a nearby communication tower. After the group broke into the station, Tano transmitted the shipyards' coordinates to Koon, Tiin, and Yularen, who were waiting in the Moskk system. Before Rex and his comrades could arrange to be evacuated from Gwori, the transmission was cut off when the shipyards' supervisor, Overseer Juhm, contacted the station and discovered the presence of the Republic strike team. Rex, Tano, and their men managed to flee with R2-D2 just before Juhm remotely destroyed the station, and Tano relayed the developments to Skywalker and Kenobi. While their superiors infiltrated the shipyards, Rex, Tano, and their team went to find cover on Gwori's plains, where a squad of jetpack-equipped B2-RP battle droids attacked them.\n\nAfter escaping from the droids, Rex and his comrades took refuge in a cave that they soon found was the current residence of a large lizard-like creature, which killed one of the clones before Tano could eliminate it. As time passed, the extended lack of communication from Skywalker and Kenobi led Tano to conclude that their commanders were in trouble. She decided that it was time to \"alter\" Skywalker's orders of staying concealed, and though Rex voiced some doubt, he left the cave with Tano and the other trooper. However, Juhm was waiting for them just outside with a squad of B2 super battle droids and killed their clone companion on sight. Presented with the choice of capitulating or being immediately gunned down, Rex and Tano decided to comply with Juhm's demands and were taken away, leaving R2-D2 back in the cave. As night fell, Juhm had Rex and Tano attached to electrically charged frames alongside Skywalker and Kenobi, who had been captured at the shipyards. Before departing, Juhm left a trio of IG-100 MagnaGuards to guard them from a horde of local spiders, his intent being to let them survive as a reminder to the shipyards' slaves of his absolute superiority. Although the four were tortured and electrocuted in turn, Rex grudgingly expressed his gratitude for the MagnaGuards' protection from the spiders.",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Teth[]\n\nWhile Skywalker and Tano were delivering a status report to Kenobi through R2-D2's holoprojector link, a pair of Confederate C-9979 landing craft approached the monastery and deployed Vulture droid starfighters and ground troops. With battle droids invading the courtyard, Rex and Skywalker mobilized Torrent Company to defend their position while Tano returned inside with Rotta. After briefly conferring with Skywalker on the weak chances of getting Tano and Rotta safely off-planet, Rex dispatched Sergeants Coric and Hez and their squads to provide covering fire for the rest of the company. Their remaining AT-TE walker was shot down, and Torrent Company began to take heavy losses. Rex joined his men in retreating into the monastery, and with everyone else inside, Skywalker ordered his captain to shut the entrance door. He initially refused, as Skywalker would be locked outside with the droids, but when his general tersely repeated the order, he complied and fired a blaster round at the controls. Skywalker used the Force to propel himself through the closing gap and into the entrance chamber, sealing all of them inside. With three-quarters of their men dead, several wounded, and only three medic-trained troopers remaining, Tano convinced her Master that it was best to find medical attention for the sick Rotta. Skywalker and his Padawan left with R2-D2 to escape from the castle while Rex remained with Torrent Company to hold their position.\n\nRex and his men braced themselves as the Separatist battalion\u2014under the command of Asajj Ventress\u2014disabled the door's lock mechanism, allowing B1, B2, and DSD1 dwarf spider droids to flood into the stronghold in overwhelming numbers. Rex watched as his men fell to enemy fire one by one before being knocked to the ground himself. Feigning death, he secretly contacted his surviving comrades through their private comm frequency and learned that only five of his men, including Coric, remained. As Ventress entered the antechamber and gave orders to an OOM command battle droid, Rex destroyed the droid with one of his DC-17 hand blasters and then targeted the Dark Acolyte. However, Ventress immediately drew her double-bladed lightsabers and deflected his laser shots. She telekinetically disarmed him of his blaster pistol and Force-choked him, demanding that he reveal Skywalker's whereabouts. Having been trained in mental resistance, Rex kept repeating his name, rank, trooper designation, and battle group to avoid succumbing to her influence. She finally gave up her interrogation and, after dropping the defiant Rex to the floor, performed a mind trick, ordering him to contact Skywalker and ask for his general's location.\n\nRex resisted Ventress's influence and commed Skywalker of his own accord, using a false voice and addressing him as \"Anakin\" instead of his usual \"General Skywalker\" to allude to Ventress's presence. Unaware of his exploit, Ventress threw him aside and departed to personally confront Skywalker, tasking her battle droids with guarding the survivors of Torrent Company. Though he suspected that his ribs had been broken, Rex mimicked unconsciousness to avoid attracting the droids' attention. He repeatedly checked in with his men over their private frequency, keeping them prepared to mount a last stand. Skywalker soon made contact via comlink, and because Rex had forgotten to divert the signal to his helmet, the battle droids overheard the device. As the enemy units converged on him, he destroyed several of the droids closest to him and stole an E-5 blaster rifle from one of them. Moving as one, the other 501st survivors\u2014Coric, Nax, Zeer, Del, and Attie\u2014sprang to their feet and also attacked their captors, pilfering blasters for themselves. Using the fallen AT-TE as cover, they engaged the droids in a crossfire. Rex took a painkiller from his utility belt medpac before reporting their situation to Skywalker. Eventually, Zeer planted explosives in an eviscerated super battle droid and detonated the unit once it had been sent back into the Confederate lines. The trap droid destroyed many of its comrades, but only a few minutes elapsed before the droids regrouped to resume their attack.",

        "content": "# Rex - Redeployment[]\n\nSkywalker brought along the replacement astromech droid R3-S6 and departed from the Resolute in his retrieved Delta-7B starfighter, unaware that R3-S6 was a spy working for Grievous. Not long after Skywalker left, Tano received a signal from the homing beacon of her Master's interceptor\u2014his covert position had been compromised. Rex quickly gathered a squad of troopers to accompany Tano aboard the Twilight, and they arrived to reinforce Skywalker, whom Grievous was cornering with two Munificent-class frigates and a squadron of Vulture droids. Because enemy fire had ruptured his hyperspace docking ring, Skywalker piloted his starfighter into the Twilight's cargo bay to retreat aboard the freighter. With Rex and his men providing covering fire as gunners, Tano maneuvered the Twilight right between the adjacent wings of the enemy frigates. As soon as they were clear, Rex engaged the Twilight's hyperdrive, executing a successful escape. A short while later, R2-D2, whom the scavenger Gha Nachkt had captured, was able to get a message through to the Twilight. Rex tracked the transmission's origin to Ruusan 2, a moon of the planet Ruusan, where they proceeded to investigate the source.\n\nWithin the upper atmosphere of Ruusan 2, Rex and his comrades found Skytop Station, the Separatist listening post that they were after, and they concluded from R2-D2's message that the astromech droid was aboard the station. Despite orders from Kenobi to focus on sabotaging the enemy outpost, Skywalker resolved to mount a dual operation to destroy the base and save R2-D2. Once the Twilight entered the gassy atmosphere of the moon, Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and four other troopers used the Force and JT-12 jetpacks, respectively, to safely land on the station many meters below. Rex carried R3-S6 to the station at Tano's behest, a job he was not enthusiastic about undertaking because of the astromech's substantial weight. Upon landing with the heavy R3-S6 in his arms, he insisted that he would never lug around an astromech droid again. Rex entered the station with the squad and joined another trooper in shooting down two B1 battle droid guards in their path. At a nearby computer terminal, R3-S6 accessed the building schematics of the battlesphere, which Rex used to brief their team on the location of the station's reactors. If its reactors were destroyed, Skytop Station's repulsorlift generators would be compromised, which would consequently plummet the battlesphere to Ruusan 2's surface.\n\nWhile Skywalker left to rescue R2-D2 on his own, Rex, Tano, and their men went to plant explosives at the reactor room thirty levels below, where they found that an alarm had triggered the door's ray shield. R3-S6 plugged into a terminal and tried to bypass the shield, but as time went on, Rex became doubtful of R3-S6's abilities and questioned them. Though Tano admonished him, telling him to be patient, R3-S6 was actually stalling to give a battle droid patrol time to ambush the Republic team. The astromech droid's efforts succeeded when a squad of B1 battle droids reached their location and attacked them. While Tano deflected laser shots with her lightsaber, Rex and his men used the hallway's supports as cover and opened fire on the battle droids. Meanwhile, R3-S6 activated the reactor room's secondary door, sealing off the Jedi and clones from the reactors. When B2 super battle droids arrived from the other direction, effectively outgunning the clone troopers and trapping them in a crossfire, Tano had Rex utilize electromagnetic pulse grenades\u2014nicknamed \"droid poppers\"\u2014against their adversaries. A grenade tossed in both directions deactivated all of the droids, though the ensuing respite in fighting did not last long. Immediately thereafter, Grievous arrived and confronted the team, batting Tano aside and attacking Rex and the clone troopers. They targeted their blasterfire at Grievous but were knocked aside, and all of the troopers save for Rex and Denal were killed.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Order 66\n\nAs she defended herself, Rex did all he could to assist her, stunning as many clones as he could using his blasters. However, Tano began to lose the fight as the blaster bolts began to hit her beskar-plated armor. The clones, realizing the droids were at fault, began to fire upon them, forcing CH-33P and G-G to move back. However, as this occurred, Maul stole the shuttle and began to use it to escape the Venator. Finally managing to fully climb up, Tano ran towards the shuttle and used the Force in an attempt to stop Maul from escaping. As she did this, Maul increased power to the thrusters, causing her to begin sliding across the floor of the hangar and forcing Rex to grab her hand to stop her from slipping away. However, reinforcements began to arrive in the hangar, which Rex noted to Tano, who was still attempting to hold Maul back. Being forced to divert his attention, Rex was forced to let go and defend her from the oncoming clones. Tano continued to strain and witnessed as R7 was killed by one of the clones' stray blaster bolts. However, seeing that Rex was beginning to become overwhelmed by the clones, Tano was forced to let go of the shuttle and allow Maul to escape. Tano then rushed back into battle alongside Rex.\n\nBeing forced to defend herself from all sides, Tano saw that they were vastly outnumbered and threw her lightsabers into the ground, using the Force to cut a hole through it in order to escape into the starship bay below. However, they were once again met by clones\u2014Jesse and the other troopers whom the astromechs had dropped below\u2014ready to fight them once again. As Jesse ordered for the clones to attack, Tano was once again forced to defend herself. Luckily, from above, CH-33P and G-G managed to manipulate the lifts once more, forcing many clones back up into the main hangar. However, the two droids' efforts did not go unnoticed and the two were promptly executed by the clones. Finishing off the remaining troopers, Rex and Tano began to look around the starship bay for another ship to escape with, coming up with nothing as most ships located there were under maintenance.\n\nEventually, Tano managed to spot a lone Y-wing starfighter, but, before they could reach it, they were once again attacked by the clones. In an attempt to reach the shuttle, Tano jumped across one of the lifts and used the Force to push Rex onto the Y-wing. As many more clones arrived on the lifts, Tano used the Force to push them all aside, but still began to be overwhelmed. Concurrently, the Star Destroyer began to break apart and lost all artificial gravity onboard, causing everything on the ship to begin falling towards the moon's surface. This forced Tano to use her lightsabers in an attempt to stop herself from falling. As she did this, Rex asked her to hurry up and rush to the Y-wing, leading Tano to muster enough energy to run across the surface of the hangar and attempted to jump onto the Y-wing, but fell the into open air as the Y-wing fell out of the hangar.\n\nTano began to fly through the open air as Rex searched for her within the Y-wing, eventually spotting her and opening the gunner's hatch for her to climb inside. Tano attempted to use the air around her to reach the Y-wing, but, as she grabbed hold, she lost her grip and flew away. Tano was now forced to use the debris to her advantage and ran across one of the destroyed engines in an attempt to regroup with Rex. With one final jump, Tano was forced to use the Force to pull herself closer to the gunner's seat, finally being able to grab hold and climb into the hatch. Having finally rescued her, Rex flew the Y-wing away as the Tribunal, and the clones, went down in flames.",

While Kryze ran after Saxon, Tano ordered Rex to get a medic as Almec informed Tano that Maul had had a vision in which the name had come to him. As Almec slowly died, Tano cried out for him to tell her the name of the individual. With this, Almec slowly breathed out \"Skywalker\" before dying in Tano's arms. Tano, briefly shocked by this, eventually recovered and rejoined Rex and Kryze\u2014who had lost Saxon in her pursuit of him\u2014in returning to the royal palace.\n\nAfter heading back to the palace, Tano, alongside Kryze, Rex, Wren, and several other Mandalorians, stood atop a balcony overlooking one of Sundari's streets where the citizens were being ordered to move to shelter locations by clones to which they received major backlash from the citizens for, not liking to clones present in Sundari. Eventually, Kryze had had enough of this and walked away as Tano and Rex followed close behind. As they entered the palace, Kryze informed Rex and Tano that the citizens of Sundari would not accept a Republic occupation for much longer and that neither would she. As a response, Rex argued that he and his men did not want to remain as a police force within the city with Tano adding that they would leave once Maul was captured and that Kryze would then be granted her opportunity to lead the people. However, as she said this, Maul appeared sitting in the throne of the Grand Salon along with the captured Jesse, whom Maul had managed to retrieve information from regarding Tano using the Force.\n\nKryze attempted to attack Maul by pulling out her WESTAR-35 blaster pistols and firing several blaster bolts at the Sith Lord before being stopped by Maul who used the Force to hold her in place. He briefly held her there before dropping her, leading to Tano and Rex to rush to her aid. Maul then released Jesse back into their care as a show of good faith towards them. As Jesse arrived back with them, Rex asked if he was alright to which Jesse apologized, noting that he had told Maul everything before Tano ordered Rex to get Jesse out of the palace. As Rex left, explosions began to ring outside\u2014having been orchestrated by Maul in a counterattack from the super commandos in order for Tano and him to be left alone\u2014causing Tano to turn her head and Maul to ask that one of them deal with the explosions. Tano asked for Kryze to go, which led Maul to stand up and announce that he and Tano would be fine together. With a final plea from Tano for her to leave, Kryze put her helmet back on and rushed outside to defend her people.\n\nNow left alone, Maul began to note how ignorant all combatants outside were, which led to Tano asking why Maul was doing this for either her or the Jedi Council to hear. To this, Maul noted that he specifically wanted to speak with her. With this, Maul mentioned Tano's betrayal by the Jedi Order and asked if this were true to which Tano asserted that she had left voluntarily. Maul acknowledged this but pointed out that her decision was motivated by the Jedi Council's hypocrisy. Him noting this caused Tano to briefly pause before Maul mentioned how he too had been a tool used by another power beyond himself.\n\nTano then walked forward and announced that she was there to bring Maul to justice, to which he claimed that justice was just the construct of the current power structure's morals. He also noted that he believed that the current government would soon be toppled, leading Tano to ask if Darth Sidious would be behind what he predicted. Maul then explained that Sidious was behind everything that had recently transpired in the galaxy, always orchestrating events from the shadows, but that would soon reveal himself. Tano then asked for Maul to join her and help the Jedi stop Sidious before he took control over the galaxy. However, Maul knew that the Republic had already fallen and that she just couldn't see this. He went on to explain that the Jedi would not be able to defeat Sidious and that their time had already passed, but that he believed that he and Tano might be able to defeat Sidious if they worked together.",

        "content": "# Rex - Mission to JanFathal[]\n\nAs Pellaeon briefed the impromptu team on the objective at hand, Rex objected when Pellaeon implied that he intended to participate in the mission; the clone captain cited that in the absence of embarked troops, the responsibility fell to him and his men. He noted that all they could hope for was a successful rescue operation and not a full-scale ouster of the Separatists from JanFathal. Eris and Masana voiced their desire to reconnoiter Athar on their own, as they did not approve of clone trooper production on account of their beliefs, but Rex and his men insisted that it was their job. With a plan in place, the team headed down to Leveler's hangar bay, where a replenishment shuttle was prepared for them to take to JanFathal. Rex refused Pellaeon's suggestion to use civilian clothing, stating that he preferred armor advantages to stealth, and also assured the distressed Pellaeon that they would rescue Devis. Once the sensor technician Benb finished outfitting the shuttle, Rex and his men boarded the craft alongside Tano, Altis, Masana, and Eris. As Sergeant Coric flew them to Athar, Rex attempted to mediate a heated conversation between Tano and the Altisian Jedi, whose controversial beliefs conflicted with the orthodox Jedi principles upon which she had been raised. He also checked in with his rookie troopers over their private circuit and took pity on the new inductees, as they had not been prepared to be confronted with Jedi of such incongruous beliefs and behavior.\n\nAfter bypassing a Separatist landing craft, Coric landed the team's shuttle in the south district of Athar. Rex immediately disembarked with the others and headed for a nearby building, where Altis and Ross worked with a recording remote to observe the surrounding enemy deployments in the city. Rex, Tano, and Masana then moved in to reconnoiter the vicinity of the building where the Separatist-backed rebels were holding Devis. Rex formed a plan for a standard hostage extraction, electing to first secure the building's exit and then deploy teams to infiltrate the structure via the roof and front entrance. After the rest of the team joined them, Rex sent Altis with Joc, Ince, and Ross to cover the exit and led the others to enter the building via the roof. Once Altis had distracted Devis's captors\u2014the young insurgents Merish Hath, Shil Kaval, and Varti\u2014Rex and his men used explosives to open a hole in the roof and joined the Jedi in confronting the rebels. Though Varti, holding his blaster to Devis, tried to bargain with him, Rex surprised everyone by laconically shooting down Varti, subsequently freeing Devis. He used a vibroblade from his gauntlet to sever Devis's handcuffs and ushered her toward the exit, ignoring her attempts to retrieve her comlink from the badly wounded Kaval.\n\nAfter Devis had been moved to safety, the building began to crumble, and Rex charged out of the structure with Altis, Vere, and Boro. While Ince headed to Coric's shuttle with Devis, Rex joined the fight against an incoming force of battle droids. In the ensuing battle, Vere was wounded beyond help, leaving Rex pained with the loss of the rookie trooper. Although Boro tried to revive Vere, Rex told him to continue fighting, as Boro endangered his own life with every second he spent trying to help Vere. Launching grenades at the droid infantry with his rifle, Rex prepared to lay charges and sacrifice himself so that the others could escape, despite protests from both Tano and Boro. Before Rex could execute his plan, Altis, Masana, and Tano focused through the Force, toppling an adjacent building onto the droids and barricading the enemy's path with rubble. Rex contacted Coric and was surprised to learn that the sergeant\u2014despite having been ordered to wait only for Devis and the Jedi\u2014was landing nearby to extract the rest of the team. Although Coric had disobeyed orders, Rex was grateful that he had decided to return for them.",

        "content": "# Rex - Outpost inspections[]\n\nMore droid commandos appeared and ambushed Rex and Cody, who exchanged fire with them while using some of the surrounding crates as cover. The droids tossed a series of thermal detonators at the Obex, forcing the two officers to jump off the landing platform. They fired their blaster cables at the underside of the platform and rappelled to the ground below; the droids, meanwhile, presumed that the explosion had claimed their lives. With the Obex destroyed, Rex and Cody mused over being stranded on the Rishi moon, recalling their similar situation on Tibrin. They came across the three survivors of the droid assault\u2014Hevy, Fives, and Echo, who had also launched the warning flare\u2014and Rex ordered them to take off their helmets to verify that they were clones. After the three did so, a predatory Rishi eel emerged from a nearby crevice; Rex impressed the three rookie troopers by expertly killing the eel with a single blaster shot to its eye. Once they introduced themselves, Rex and Cody learned from Echo that their sergeant had died in the initial attack. Dubbing Echo, Hevy, and Fives \"shinies,\" a derogatory term for their as-yet-unspoiled armor, Rex placed a handprint of blood from the eel's carcass on Echo's armor to commemorate his valor.\n\nWhen Hevy expressed the rookies' shared desire to recover their outpost regardless of their inexperience, Rex stated that there was hope for them yet. The five troopers climbed up the canyon wall to Rishi Station, with Rex and Cody offering the carbines of their DC-15S blasters to the rookie troopers. Rex devised a plan to gain access to the enemy-held base, posing as Commando Unit 26 in clone armor and mechanically walking toward the blast doors' surveillance systems. He conferred with Droid Units 07, 08, and 09, who were guarding the entrance from inside. He maintained his cover by pretending to adjust his \"vocabulator\" and using an inert droid head as visual verification of his identity. Although Cody doubted the tactic would work, the droids admitted Rex entry, and he and the others gunned down the guards with celerity. Taking point despite Hevy's request for the lead position, Rex led the assault on the droids in the command center. He gunned down several of the droid commandos manning the central computer before the droid commando captain targeted him from atop a perch on a higher level. Rex blasted the droid's blaster out of his hand, which only caused his opponent to draw a vibroblade, but he quickly snapped the droid's neck with his gloved hands.\n\nThough Rex and the others triumphed over the droid commandos, their victory was short-lived. The group of five discovered that a Separatist fleet\u2014led by General Grievous\u2014was passing over the moon, and they deduced that the droids had hot-wired the station's all-clear signal to prevent the Republic from learning of the impending invasion. To investigate the lack of response from the droid commandos, Grievous dispatched a C-9979 troopship, which landed at the base and deployed droid infantry reinforcements. As Cody noted their slim chances of success, Rex decided that they had to destroy Rishi Station: Despite the plan's lack of convention, the subsequent cessation of the all-clear signal would alert the Republic to the invasion. Echo contributed to Rex's plan, offering that they could repurpose the station's supply of liquid Tibanna gas as explosives to raze the facility. Before setting the operation into motion, Rex and Cody spoke with Echo, Fives, and Hevy to prepare them for the forthcoming battle. Rex stated that the Confederacy's main target could only be Kamino and cited its personal importance to the clones, rallying the rookie troopers with the knowledge that they were fighting for all of their brethren back home on Kamino.",

        "content": "# Rex - Shipyards of Gwori[]\n\nIn an attempt to free themselves, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi used the Force to destroy the MagnaGuards, and R2-D2 arrived and cut them and Rex from their frames before the spiders could attack. The team proceeded to the shipyards and convinced Juhm's slaves, who numbered over a thousand, to emancipate themselves from their servitude. At dawn the next day, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi stole one of the shipyards' near-completed Munificent-class star frigates and escaped aboard it with the ex-slaves, just as Koon and Tiin arrived with their team of bombers. Koon and Tiin led the BTL-B Y-wing starfighters of Hunter Squadron on their strike on the Banking Clan facility, dropping their munitions on the site. Skywalker, meanwhile, used their frigate's tractor beam to retrieve trooper Toomer, who had been left behind at the drop zone when his carbonite slab's controls malfunctioned, and headed for the Separatist blockade. However, the battle droids overseeing the blockade detected the multitude of life forms aboard the stolen frigate, and at Juhm's behest, they activated the radiation beam. Before the beam could vaporize Rex and the other passengers, Koon and Tiin intervened, disabling the scan gate that was projecting the beam. The two Jedi Masters hitched a ride on the vessel, as their hyperdrive booster rings had been destroyed, and they left the Gwori system for Coruscant, where Juhm's ex-slaves found employment with the Republic. Once Toomer had been freed from his carbonite, Rex reassured the disappointed trooper that there would be more fighting to come.",

        "content": "# Rex - Mission to JanFathal[]\n\nAt least six months into the war, Rex agreed to relieve Skywalker of his Padawan for a few days by taking her along on a three-day shakedown cruise aboard Republic Navy Captain Gilad Pellaeon's newly refitted assault ship, Leveler, in the Dantus sector. After Pellaeon, an old acquaintance of his, permitted him to take part in Leveler's testing session, Rex departed to join the cruise with Tano, Sergeant Coric, and six clone troopers new to Torrent Company\u2014Ross, Boro, Joc, Hil, Vere, and Ince, who had completed their training several days prior. En route to Leveler aboard a shuttle, Tano questioned if her Master had taken a respite from training just for a break from her, but Rex abstained from directly answering to avoid speculating about Skywalker. He was more concerned about his new troops: He was considering using the inconsiderate tally sensor to tell the six apart because they had so far failed to display unique personalities. After Rex and his men arrived aboard Leveler, Pellaeon greeted them and allowed them to move into their barracks. At Tano's request, Rex took her to examine Leveler's experimental concussion missiles, and Pellaeon joined them at one of the missile bays.\n\nRex and Pellaeon were cut off from a discussion about Leveler's new weapons by an alert that a flotilla of Confederate ships had exited hyperspace in the nearby Fath sector. While Rex and Pellaeon monitored the Separatist activity, Tano sensed a disturbance in the Force that, at Rex's advice, Pellaeon took seriously. Despite the possibility that the enemy activity would not result in anything, Rex took precautions and went to round up his men in case they were needed. After Rex returned to Torrent Company's barracks and relayed the situation, Joc's inquiries into Pellaeon's private life sparked a debate between Tano and the rookie clones about the Jedi Code's ban on emotional attachment. Rex ended the argument by putting his men on standby, while Tano departed to check out the ops room at his suggestion. Once she had left, Rex reproved his men for putting her on the spot but was also pleased that they were settling in and expressing themselves. In an effort to keep them occupied, he took his men to the hangar deck to perform some deck circuits and familiarize themselves with the Fath system, where Leveler was headed to keep a closer eye on the active Separatist armada.\n\nRex contacted Skywalker to inform him of their diversion to the Fath system, and Skywalker responded by setting off to rendezvous with Leveler despite his captain's admission that his involvement was unnecessary. After taking a moment to shave his hair from a blue-dyed haircut\u2014in support of the Sullustan Bylluran Athletic bolo-ball team\u2014Rex joined Tano and Pellaeon on the bridge just as the warship became host to the Altisian Jedi sect. Jedi Master Djinn Altis, who spoke for the group, asked for permission to dock his freighter, Wookiee Gunner, on the grounds of receiving a distress signal from a Republic agent on the nearby planet JanFathal. Republic Intelligence confirmed Altis's story and reported that the agent had been captured during a Separatist-allied rebel uprising. Pellaeon approved the rendezvous with Altis, and Rex promised his men for the hostage extraction that they would soon be performing. However, matters were complicated when the captive operative was identified as Hallena Devis, a close acquaintance of Pellaeon. While Rex and his men were examining JanFathal's capital of Athar\u2014where Devis was being held\u2014via a holochart in Leveler's meeting room, Altis and fellow Jedi Callista Masana and Geith Eris convened with them, Pellaeon, and Tano to formulate a plan to rescue Devis.\n\nAs Pellaeon briefed the impromptu team on the objective at hand, Rex objected when Pellaeon implied that he intended to participate in the mission; the clone captain cited that in the absence of embarked troops, the responsibility fell to him and his men. He noted that all they could hope for was a successful rescue operation and not a full-scale ouster of the Separatists from JanFathal. Eris and Masana voiced their desire to reconnoiter Athar on their own, as they did not approve of clone trooper production on account of their beliefs, but Rex and his men insisted that it was their job. With a plan in place, the team headed down to Leveler's hangar bay, where a replenishment shuttle was prepared for them to take to JanFathal. Rex refused Pellaeon's suggestion to use civilian clothing, stating that he preferred armor advantages to stealth, and also assured the distressed Pellaeon that they would rescue Devis. Once the sensor technician Benb finished outfitting the shuttle, Rex and his men boarded the craft alongside Tano, Altis, Masana, and Eris. As Sergeant Coric flew them to Athar, Rex attempted to mediate a heated conversation between Tano and the Altisian Jedi, whose controversial beliefs conflicted with the orthodox Jedi principles upon which she had been raised. He also checked in with his rookie troopers over their private circuit and took pity on the new inductees, as they had not been prepared to be confronted with Jedi of such incongruous beliefs and behavior.\n\nAfter bypassing a Separatist landing craft, Coric landed the team's shuttle in the south district of Athar. Rex immediately disembarked with the others and headed for a nearby building, where Altis and Ross worked with a recording remote to observe the surrounding enemy deployments in the city. Rex, Tano, and Masana then moved in to reconnoiter the vicinity of the building where the Separatist-backed rebels were holding Devis. Rex formed a plan for a standard hostage extraction, electing to first secure the building's exit and then deploy teams to infiltrate the structure via the roof and front entrance. After the rest of the team joined them, Rex sent Altis with Joc, Ince, and Ross to cover the exit and led the others to enter the building via the roof. Once Altis had distracted Devis's captors\u2014the young insurgents Merish Hath, Shil Kaval, and Varti\u2014Rex and his men used explosives to open a hole in the roof and joined the Jedi in confronting the rebels. Though Varti, holding his blaster to Devis, tried to bargain with him, Rex surprised everyone by laconically shooting down Varti, subsequently freeing Devis. He used a vibroblade from his gauntlet to sever Devis's handcuffs and ushered her toward the exit, ignoring her attempts to retrieve her comlink from the badly wounded Kaval.\n\nAfter Devis had been moved to safety, the building began to crumble, and Rex charged out of the structure with Altis, Vere, and Boro. While Ince headed to Coric's shuttle with Devis, Rex joined the fight against an incoming force of battle droids. In the ensuing battle, Vere was wounded beyond help, leaving Rex pained with the loss of the rookie trooper. Although Boro tried to revive Vere, Rex told him to continue fighting, as Boro endangered his own life with every second he spent trying to help Vere. Launching grenades at the droid infantry with his rifle, Rex prepared to lay charges and sacrifice himself so that the others could escape, despite protests from both Tano and Boro. Before Rex could execute his plan, Altis, Masana, and Tano focused through the Force, toppling an adjacent building onto the droids and barricading the enemy's path with rubble. Rex contacted Coric and was surprised to learn that the sergeant\u2014despite having been ordered to wait only for Devis and the Jedi\u2014was landing nearby to extract the rest of the team. Although Coric had disobeyed orders, Rex was grateful that he had decided to return for them.\n\nOnce all of the Jedi and clones were on board, Coric piloted the shuttle out of the area, barely evading the pursuant battle droids. En route to Leveler, Devis thanked Rex for his men's efforts, but he avoided initiating a conversation with her so as to reflect on Vere's death. He noticed that Ross, Boro, Joc, Hil, and Ince had opened up a private comlink frequency and respected their privacy, knowing they needed to discuss personal matters, including the painful loss of Vere, without him overhearing. He instead voiced his congratulations to his men on the successful rescue, though he noted that JanFathal was lost to the Republic. Meanwhile, the Separatist destroyer Reaper attacked Leveler and forced Pellaeon's warship to flee to hyperspace before Coric's shuttle could dock, leaving Rex and his team to fend for themselves. With their main source of life support\u2014Leveler\u2014gone, Rex ordered Coric to disable all nonessential systems. Boro calculated that with their limited oxygen supply, they would only be able to make it halfway to the shipyards at Kemla Yard, the closest Republic-allied location. Instead, they elected to return to Athar and mount a last stand against the Separatist army there. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker arrived in the system aboard the V-19 Torrent starfighter Echo-97 and contacted Rex, who updated him on their situation. Rex and the others rendezvoused with Skywalker in Athar, where Skywalker was introduced to the rookie clones and the Altisian Jedi.\n\nRex and his men's spirits were lifted when Skywalker told them he had spotted several of the Separatists' hyperdrive-equipped CR-20 troop carriers, which could be used to escape off-world. Altis presently received word from his colleague Ash Jarvee that Leveler was returning to the system from a miscalculated hyperspace jump. In the meantime, Skywalker sent Rex, Masana, and the clone troopers to a road bridge along the Cadaman Royal Highway while he and the other Jedi seized a CR-20. Rex and his comrades would provide covering fire until the troop carrier lifted off and would then board the ship. Once Rex, Masana, and the clones were in position, Skywalker commandeered the troop carrier with Tano, Altis, Eris, and Devis and arrived to rescue them. Yet Ince was injured in battle with the droids, and Hil hurriedly treated him for his wounds. A Vulture droid approached and fired at some paving behind them, but Masana diverted the falling debris with the Force and edged over to attend to Ince. While Masana and the others carried the injured Ince onto the hovering troop carrier, Rex and Ross remained on the ground to keep the droid starfighter occupied.\n\nThe Vulture droid landed and advanced on the two clones in walking mode, and Ross got the droid's attention while Rex tangled its legs with his rappel line, pulling himself toward the droid. He hung on despite its attempts to throw him off, causing the droid to become increasingly more tangled in the line. Rex and Ross's combined blasterfire brought down the droid, and they escaped to the CR-20, which Skywalker promptly piloted toward Leveler. While the wounded Ince was stabilized, the battle-weary Rex manned the CR-20's blaster cannons with Tano, returning fire at the attacking Separatist armada. As soon as their CR-20 landed aboard Leveler, the assault ship escaped to hyperspace; Ince, meanwhile, was rushed to the medbay. Rex joined his comrades there, trying to endure the aggravating wait for developments in Ince's case. When Ince died from blood loss, Rex, devastated and furious with the loss of a second soldier within a single day, took refuge in the mess hall. Tano found him there and consulted him about the Altisian Jedi views on the Clone Army, a discussion that soon undermined Rex's own beliefs as well as Tano's. Accepting that he and his comrades were making the best of an unwanted situation, Rex finally regained stability with his principles, though Tano found it more difficult to do so.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Further campaigns[]\n\nRex and Tano joined Skywalker in the stands to watch the race and learned that Skywalker, who believed that Messo's contact belonged to one of the teams in the racing circuit, had entered Tano as a contestant to go undercover with the other racers. They proceeded to the Podracing stalls to begin outfitting Tano's Podracer, with Rex, Skywalker, and R2-D2 posing as her pit crew. The skilled Podracer Kidd Kareen became their prime suspect for being Messo's correspondent, as Tano learned via Jedi intelligence that several recent espionage incidents had coincided with the racing circuit's presence in the same system, with Kareen and his crew being present for each of the events. Once Kareen's crew had left their stall for the day, Tano kept Kareen occupied while Skywalker took a look around the stall, with Rex and R2-D2 on lookout. However, Kareen's fellow crew member San Maxus caught Skywalker snooping around, and a fistfight erupted between the Jedi and Kareen's crew. Shortly after Rex joined the fray, Tano and Kareen returned and halted the fight, and Tano was forced to apologize for her crew's actions. Rex and his comrades hurriedly left to prepare when they learned that the Padawan's debut race was next.\n\nAt the race, Rex and Skywalker tracked Tano's progress through the course via R2-D2's hololink, rushing to her aid when another Podracer rammed her from behind near the finish line. Although Tano's Podracer had been demolished in the crash, Kareen offered to loan her one of his spare Podracers. Rex and Skywalker later trailed Maxus into a pub and used R2-D2 to eavesdrop on him. They discovered that Maxus was the Separatist spy when he contacted Count Dooku, and they also overheard Dooku arranging to have another agent collect the stolen Republic datachip from Maxus the next day. That day, during Tano's next race alongside Kareen and Maxus, Rex and Skywalker noticed Maxus recovering the stolen datachip from the Podracing pits and chased after him. Though Maxus escaped, he left the rest of Kareen's crew to engage them in blaster combat. While Rex and R2-D2 fought off the Podracers, Skywalker departed to help his Padawan, and the Jedi managed to prevent Maxus from handing over the datachip to Asajj Ventress thanks to assistance from Kareen. With their task completed, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano bid farewell to Kareen before leaving Mon Gazza aboard the Twilight. The three reported their success to Kenobi, who was still on Queel.\n\nWhen rumors abounded of a new Confederate project in the Outer Rim, Rex became involved with sending Denal on various missions to counter the menace. While Denal was on Rodia investigating the rumors, Rex contacted him and ordered him to make way for Republic reinforcements by purging a nearby jungle clearing of battle droids. Once Denal had done so, Rex sent him to destroy a transport factory by activating its self-destruct mechanism. At Rex's behest, Denal next took a squad to Tatooine to scout out an allegedly deserted Separatist base, which was discovered to be teeming with droid forces. After Denal's team cleared the outpost of hostiles, Rex relayed the news that another enemy base\u2014this time a research station\u2014had been discovered on Tatooine. As the outpost was reportedly connected to the new Separatist project, Rex told Denal to act quickly before the facility could be evacuated and any evidence destroyed. Denal infiltrated the station and uncovered plans for a superweapon that could cloak entire armies from the Republic. He later destroyed the superweapon at its construction site on the ice world Orto Plutonia. Shortly after Denal returned to the Republic fleet and received commendations from Kenobi, Rex dispatched the trooper on yet another assignment.",

As she did this, an explosion shattered the glass around the pair. Eventually, Tano decided that she would help Maul on the condition that he answer her question on why he wanted Skywalker to come to Mandalore. To this, Maul explained that Skywalker was the key to Sidious' plan, which led Tano to ask if he was the Chosen One, but Maul knew that his role was in fact to destroy the Jedi and that he had long been groomed for his task. Tano then claimed that Maul was lying, but Maul remained firm in his beliefs, claiming that he had orchestrated the current war on Mandalore in order to lure Skywalker and Kenobi there in an effort to kill Skywalker, depriving Sidious of his prized pupil and his main pawn.\n\nTano rejected this answer and ignited her lightsabers, ready to fight Maul and take him into custody, claiming that Maul's vision was flawed and that she knew Skywalker well enough to know what he said could never happen. To this, Maul ignited his own weapon and claimed that he needed to teach her one last lesson. Maul then lunged at Tano and the two began their duel.\n\nTano managed to dodge several of his attacks before being forced to parry several of his other attacks. She then saw an opening in Maul's defenses and began to attack him, forcing him back on the defensive. Tano attempted to kick Maul to no avail, leading to him managing to elbow her in the face and forcing her shoto blade to leave her hand. Tano was now on the defensive once more, being forced to fight with only one saber; however, she soon managed to kick Maul, allowing her a brief opening to use the Force and retrieve her blade, forcing Maul to evade the saber as it returned to her hand. The fight then took a brief pause as Tano insulted Maul by claiming that if Skywalker had shown up, Maul wouldn't have lasted long in their fight to which Maul commented that Tano had Kenobi's arrogance before she swung her saber at him, mentioning that she likely had many qualities he disliked.\n\nResuming the fight, Tano managed to gain the upper hand but was eventually forced to jump back several times to evade Maul's attacks. Forced in a saber lock, Maul grunted, attempting to disorient Tano, but this gave her the opportunity to kick him outside of one of the palace's windows. Tano briefly paused to catch her breath before chasing after Maul to resume their fight.\n\nAs Tano emerged outside, she witnessed Mandalorian reinforcements arrive to aid the clones in warding off the super commandos' attack; however, as she turned her head, she noticed Maul attempting to escape atop a building leading her to chase him to the support beams of the domed city's ceiling. As she reached the support beams, Tano reignited her lightsabers and claimed that Kenobi had been right in his comment that Maul would be hard to kill. As Maul turned to look at her, Tano rushed at him as he reignited his own lightsaber to continue their duel.\n\nHe blocked her oncoming attacks as she lunged at him, briefly forcing her on the defensive before regaining herself and attempting to kick Maul, but he managed to evade. As the fight continued, Tano jumped back on one of the support beams and almost lost her footing, but managed to regain herself before Maul exclaimed that if she had joined him they could have destroyed Sidious together, but Tano knew that this would have only been for Maul to take his place, which she commented in response. As Maul jumped towards her, Tano managed to elbow and kick him to another support beam, causing Maul to briefly be caught off balance. She then once again lunged at him, but was forced off and kicked back, barely managing to hold onto a support beam.",

        "content": "# Rex - Outpost inspections[]\n\nRex was stationed with Skywalker, Tano, and Admiral Yularen aboard Skywalker's flagship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute, when it was deployed to the Bith system during the emerging threat of a new Separatist superweapon. After the enemy weapon executed a devastating assault on Plo Koon's forces in the nearby Abregado system, the Resolute was reassigned to protect the Republic's supply convoys alongside Kenobi; his flagship, the Negotiator; and the rest of their fleet. Skywalker thereafter divided his armada to increase their defensive perimeter and departed with Tano to scout ahead for enemy activity. Rex was present on the Resolute's bridge with Yularen when Kenobi contacted them to check on their progress as well as Skywalker's whereabouts. Yularen reported that the convoys were on schedule and also informed Kenobi of Skywalker's orders. Skywalker and Tano soon discovered that the Separatist superweapon was the Malevolence, a powerful Subjugator-class heavy cruiser that was equipped with an ion pulse cannon. Rex later reviewed the file on the Abregado incident, hoping that it would give him an edge in future battles against the Separatists. The Resolute was again reassigned, this time to join a Republic naval strike on the Malevolence near the Kaliida Nebula. The ensuing Battle of the Kaliida Nebula saw the battleship eradicated, its threat to the Republic ended.\n\nRex and Commander Cody were next assigned to inspect several small but integral Republic bases and listening posts. Their first inspection site was a tracking station in the Pastil system. Upon arrival on Pastil aboard Rex's Nu-class attack shuttle, the Obex, Rex began assessing the outpost with Cody and commented on the station's extreme cleanliness. Trooper Stripe informed them that an MSE-series droid nicknamed \"Rodent\" maintained the base, mentioning that the droid had a glitch and spent hours cleaning the outpost. Recognizing the droid's characteristics as those of a spy droid, Rex called out a Code Aurek alert and ordered the facility's troopers to track down Rodent. The rookie clones were unaware of Rex's suspicions and initially thought he was crazy, but when Rex found the droid and blasted its body, the droid's wheels activated of their own accord and fled, a feature uncommon in regular MSE droids. The troopers eliminated three of the wheels, and when the fourth made for a grate, Stripe destroyed it with a thermal detonator; the resulting explosion caused a significant amount of damage to the hallway. Amused with Stripe's solution, Rex told the troops to clean up the mess before leaving the station with Cody.\n\nAfter Cody reported their successful inspection to Skywalker and Kenobi, who were aboard the Resolute, he and Rex proceeded to Rishi Station, an outpost in the Outer Rim's Rishi system. They were unaware that Confederate BX-series droid commandos had just overrun the base. When Cody contacted Rishi Station for landing authorization, a droid commando posing as a clone trooper answered the transmission. Hearing the trooper's droid-like responses, Rex sensed that something was amiss but continued with Cody to the moon where the outpost was located, with Cody placing him in charge of the inspection. Upon landing at the station, Rex noted the absence of an on-duty deck officer, remarking that such an error was sloppy. A droid commando disguised in clone armor came out to greet Rex and Cody. When Rex caught sight of a droid attack flare launched from close by, he promptly shot the \"trooper\" who had greeted them in the head. At first, Cody was shocked with his brazen behavior, but Rex removed his victim's helmet to unmask the disabled droid.\n\nMore droid commandos appeared and ambushed Rex and Cody, who exchanged fire with them while using some of the surrounding crates as cover. The droids tossed a series of thermal detonators at the Obex, forcing the two officers to jump off the landing platform. They fired their blaster cables at the underside of the platform and rappelled to the ground below; the droids, meanwhile, presumed that the explosion had claimed their lives. With the Obex destroyed, Rex and Cody mused over being stranded on the Rishi moon, recalling their similar situation on Tibrin. They came across the three survivors of the droid assault\u2014Hevy, Fives, and Echo, who had also launched the warning flare\u2014and Rex ordered them to take off their helmets to verify that they were clones. After the three did so, a predatory Rishi eel emerged from a nearby crevice; Rex impressed the three rookie troopers by expertly killing the eel with a single blaster shot to its eye. Once they introduced themselves, Rex and Cody learned from Echo that their sergeant had died in the initial attack. Dubbing Echo, Hevy, and Fives \"shinies,\" a derogatory term for their as-yet-unspoiled armor, Rex placed a handprint of blood from the eel's carcass on Echo's armor to commemorate his valor.\n\nWhen Hevy expressed the rookies' shared desire to recover their outpost regardless of their inexperience, Rex stated that there was hope for them yet. The five troopers climbed up the canyon wall to Rishi Station, with Rex and Cody offering the carbines of their DC-15S blasters to the rookie troopers. Rex devised a plan to gain access to the enemy-held base, posing as Commando Unit 26 in clone armor and mechanically walking toward the blast doors' surveillance systems. He conferred with Droid Units 07, 08, and 09, who were guarding the entrance from inside. He maintained his cover by pretending to adjust his \"vocabulator\" and using an inert droid head as visual verification of his identity. Although Cody doubted the tactic would work, the droids admitted Rex entry, and he and the others gunned down the guards with celerity. Taking point despite Hevy's request for the lead position, Rex led the assault on the droids in the command center. He gunned down several of the droid commandos manning the central computer before the droid commando captain targeted him from atop a perch on a higher level. Rex blasted the droid's blaster out of his hand, which only caused his opponent to draw a vibroblade, but he quickly snapped the droid's neck with his gloved hands.\n\nThough Rex and the others triumphed over the droid commandos, their victory was short-lived. The group of five discovered that a Separatist fleet\u2014led by General Grievous\u2014was passing over the moon, and they deduced that the droids had hot-wired the station's all-clear signal to prevent the Republic from learning of the impending invasion. To investigate the lack of response from the droid commandos, Grievous dispatched a C-9979 troopship, which landed at the base and deployed droid infantry reinforcements. As Cody noted their slim chances of success, Rex decided that they had to destroy Rishi Station: Despite the plan's lack of convention, the subsequent cessation of the all-clear signal would alert the Republic to the invasion. Echo contributed to Rex's plan, offering that they could repurpose the station's supply of liquid Tibanna gas as explosives to raze the facility. Before setting the operation into motion, Rex and Cody spoke with Echo, Fives, and Hevy to prepare them for the forthcoming battle. Rex stated that the Confederacy's main target could only be Kamino and cited its personal importance to the clones, rallying the rookie troopers with the knowledge that they were fighting for all of their brethren back home on Kamino.\n\nWhile Cody, Hevy, and Fives confronted the battle droids at the entrance, Rex and Echo ushered several PLNK-series power droids, or \"plunk droids,\" containing the liquid Tibanna into the command center. As they wired the three plunk droids together, Rex encountered problems with the detonator's remote handset. Hevy offered to stay and repair the remote, allowing Rex, Cody, Echo, and Fives to escape outside via a maintenance pipe. Rex assumed that Hevy had summarily fixed the remote and was right behind them, but when he told Hevy to detonate the explosives, he discovered that the trooper had not yet joined them. He contacted Hevy and ordered him to vacate the base, but Hevy stated that he would have to manually activate the charges due to the remote's defectiveness, ignoring Rex's protests. Although Rex and the others backtracked to help their comrade, Hevy sacrificed himself to destroy the base and warn the Republic of the Separatist invasion. The termination of the all-clear signal elicited an immediate reaction from the Republic fleet, which arrived and drove Grievous's invasion force out of the system. LAAT/i gunships collected Rex, Cody, Fives, and Echo from the moon and brought them aboard the Resolute. In the Star Destroyer's hangar, Skywalker and Kenobi commended Echo and Fives for their valor, awarding them medals, and also honored Hevy's sacrifice. Rex, impressed by the efforts of the former \"shinies,\" inducted Fives and Echo into the 501st Legion.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Redeployment[]\n\nRex and Skywalker soon returned to Coruscant, where Rex manned a blaster training range to maintain his troops' marksmanship skills. Just over a week after their return, word reached the Jedi High Council that General Grievous was targeting the planet Bothawui, home to the key Republic-affiliated Bothan Spynet. Skywalker was subsequently given command of his own battle group to defend the strategic world from the Confederacy. Kenobi, who was out of action due to being injured in a recent terrorist bombing, had Rex and the 501st Legion put on standby, knowing that Skywalker would want them for his strike force. After receiving his orders, Rex got his men settled on the Resolute, which was being prepared for Skywalker's fleet along with two other Venator-class Star Destroyers, the Pioneer and Dauntless. He enjoyed a brief reunion with Skywalker and Tano, who were pleased that he had been assigned to their task force. Once all was ready, they set off for the Both system, with Grievous and an armada of four Munificent-class star frigates pursuing them there. Although they beat Grievous to Bothawui, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano learned from Kenobi that Grievous had not abandoned his pursuit of them.\n\nAs Kenobi told them, Grievous was still on course to the Both system, having merely stopped to take on two additional frigates, which he had used to overwhelm Republic forces on the planet Falleen. Despite being outnumbered two-to-one in vessels, Skywalker was intent on protecting Bothawui and was unwilling to let it fall to the Confederacy. He deployed a detachment of AT-TE walkers under Rex's command to the asteroid belt surrounding the gas giant Bothawui Prime, from where they would be able to outflank Grievous once his fleet passed through the asteroids. After Grievous's frigates arrived in the system, proceeded through the asteroid belt\u2014as well as the AT-TEs hidden there\u2014and opened fire on the Republic Star Destroyers, Rex and his men turned the tide of the battle by attacking the frigates, targeting their aft sections. The ambush was all the more successful because the unsuspecting Grievous had diverted all of his frigates' power to their forward shields instead of their rear ones. The Resolute, Pioneer, and Dauntless annihilated the trapped Separatist armada but not before Grievous could flee from his command ship. Skywalker's Delta-7B starfighter took on damage while pursuing Grievous's personal starfighter, Soulless One, and veered off-course toward the asteroid belt.\n\nRex led a search-and-rescue mission into the asteroid belt; he managed to save Skywalker from his crippled starfighter but could not retrieve R2-D2, who had served as the Jedi General's astromech co-pilot. Rex and Tano met with Skywalker in the Resolute's medbay once he had regained consciousness and brought him up to date with the battle's success, albeit with the loss of R2-D2. After conducting an unsuccessful search for his astromech droid, Skywalker was forced to declare R2-D2 missing in action. Believing that the Resolute, Dauntless, and Pioneer could use modifications, Skywalker took his fleet back to the Allanteen Six shipyards, where they had been manufactured. Eventually, Kenobi contacted Skywalker and Tano and tasked them with finding a new Confederate listening post that was intercepting Grand Army transmissions. Departing from the shipyards on his new assignment, Skywalker elected to personally reconnoiter space suspected of Confederate activity while the rest of his forces concentrated on a more central path. Upon being informed of Skywalker's reconnaissance plan, Rex questioned whether he was sure about scouting ahead alone, but Skywalker was certain that more than one fighter would attract too much enemy attention.\n\nSkywalker brought along the replacement astromech droid R3-S6 and departed from the Resolute in his retrieved Delta-7B starfighter, unaware that R3-S6 was a spy working for Grievous. Not long after Skywalker left, Tano received a signal from the homing beacon of her Master's interceptor\u2014his covert position had been compromised. Rex quickly gathered a squad of troopers to accompany Tano aboard the Twilight, and they arrived to reinforce Skywalker, whom Grievous was cornering with two Munificent-class frigates and a squadron of Vulture droids. Because enemy fire had ruptured his hyperspace docking ring, Skywalker piloted his starfighter into the Twilight's cargo bay to retreat aboard the freighter. With Rex and his men providing covering fire as gunners, Tano maneuvered the Twilight right between the adjacent wings of the enemy frigates. As soon as they were clear, Rex engaged the Twilight's hyperdrive, executing a successful escape. A short while later, R2-D2, whom the scavenger Gha Nachkt had captured, was able to get a message through to the Twilight. Rex tracked the transmission's origin to Ruusan 2, a moon of the planet Ruusan, where they proceeded to investigate the source.\n\nWithin the upper atmosphere of Ruusan 2, Rex and his comrades found Skytop Station, the Separatist listening post that they were after, and they concluded from R2-D2's message that the astromech droid was aboard the station. Despite orders from Kenobi to focus on sabotaging the enemy outpost, Skywalker resolved to mount a dual operation to destroy the base and save R2-D2. Once the Twilight entered the gassy atmosphere of the moon, Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and four other troopers used the Force and JT-12 jetpacks, respectively, to safely land on the station many meters below. Rex carried R3-S6 to the station at Tano's behest, a job he was not enthusiastic about undertaking because of the astromech's substantial weight. Upon landing with the heavy R3-S6 in his arms, he insisted that he would never lug around an astromech droid again. Rex entered the station with the squad and joined another trooper in shooting down two B1 battle droid guards in their path. At a nearby computer terminal, R3-S6 accessed the building schematics of the battlesphere, which Rex used to brief their team on the location of the station's reactors. If its reactors were destroyed, Skytop Station's repulsorlift generators would be compromised, which would consequently plummet the battlesphere to Ruusan 2's surface.\n\nWhile Skywalker left to rescue R2-D2 on his own, Rex, Tano, and their men went to plant explosives at the reactor room thirty levels below, where they found that an alarm had triggered the door's ray shield. R3-S6 plugged into a terminal and tried to bypass the shield, but as time went on, Rex became doubtful of R3-S6's abilities and questioned them. Though Tano admonished him, telling him to be patient, R3-S6 was actually stalling to give a battle droid patrol time to ambush the Republic team. The astromech droid's efforts succeeded when a squad of B1 battle droids reached their location and attacked them. While Tano deflected laser shots with her lightsaber, Rex and his men used the hallway's supports as cover and opened fire on the battle droids. Meanwhile, R3-S6 activated the reactor room's secondary door, sealing off the Jedi and clones from the reactors. When B2 super battle droids arrived from the other direction, effectively outgunning the clone troopers and trapping them in a crossfire, Tano had Rex utilize electromagnetic pulse grenades\u2014nicknamed \"droid poppers\"\u2014against their adversaries. A grenade tossed in both directions deactivated all of the droids, though the ensuing respite in fighting did not last long. Immediately thereafter, Grievous arrived and confronted the team, batting Tano aside and attacking Rex and the clone troopers. They targeted their blasterfire at Grievous but were knocked aside, and all of the troopers save for Rex and Denal were killed.\n\nAs Grievous prepared to kill the unconscious Rex, Tano intervened mid-strike to block the cyborg general's blow with her own lightsaber. She continued to distract Grievous by drawing him into a storage room; Rex and Denal learned of her exploits after regaining consciousness. Although Rex protested to Tano's course of action over a comlink transmission, he complied with her orders to complete their mission. He and Denal broke into the reactor room and planted the explosives, then departed for the landing bay to rendezvous with Skywalker and the Twilight. The Jedi General was alarmed to learn that Tano had engaged Grievous in single combat and insisted that they take him to assist her. As Rex and Denal headed for the hangar's exit with Skywalker and the Twilight's clone trooper pilot, R3-S6 sealed the blast doors and the rest of the exits. The astromech droid also activated several Vulture droids hanging from recharge racks on the roof to prevent the Jedi and clones from escaping, revealing his loyalties to Grievous and the Separatists. Surrounded by Vulture droids on one side and super battle droids on the other, Rex, Skywalker, and the troopers ran for cover behind several nearby crates while returning the droids' blasterfire.\n\nDuring the ensuing firefight, Skywalker ordered Rex to activate the explosives at the reactors even though they were still in the station. Rex complied and detonated the charges, beginning Skytop Station's gravity-pulled descent into the atmosphere of Ruusan 2. Presently, Tano\u2014having escaped from Grievous\u2014reached the hangar via a ventilation shaft and joined the fight, eliminating two of the Vulture droids. When Rex noticed several fuel cells close by, Skywalker called on the Force to hurtle one of them at the droids, and Rex placed a well-aimed shot on the cell. The resulting explosion obliterated all of the battle droids. Once R2-D2 opened the hangar door via an external terminal, the Jedi and clones escaped from the doomed Skytop Station aboard the Twilight, and Skywalker completed their successful operation by finally retrieving his astromech droid.\n\nWhile Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi were serving aboard the flagship of the Republic Navy, Tano intercepted a Rebel SOS signal from Tatooine. Determined to prove herself, she secretly took a shuttle to investigate the transmission's source. Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi soon discovered her absence and also learned that the signal had been fake\u2014Tano had fallen into a Separatist trap. The two Jedi Generals quickly took the Twilight to Tatooine, where they rescued Tano from a battle droid detachment.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Entanglements\n\nTano took the Fardi ship to small, sparsely populated world in the Thabeska system. However, she was followed by a starship flown by a non-binary Black Sun agent, who had come to extort credits from her for the damage her smuggling activities with the Fardis had inflicted on the Black Sun's operations. In order to pay off these \"debts,\" the Black Sun agent offered her a job, but threatened to kill her if she did not accept her offer. Tano rejected the Black Sun agent's offer and fled back to her ship under fire. The Black Sun agent gave chase in their own ship. During the dogfight, Tano decided to cast her aside her pseudonym as \"Ashla\" for good and to embrace her identity as Ahsoka Tano.\n\nThe Black Sun ship managed to damage her freighter's starboard engine, but a larger vessel intervened before Tano's ship could sustain further damage, chasing the syndicate's starship away. Tano managed to take her freighter into space, but burned out her port engine. Before she could engage the hyperdrive, she was caught in the tractor beam of the second ship that she had encountered. This ship belonged to Tage and Tamsin, who had been sent by Organa to find Tano. Believing the second ship to be hostile as well, Tano armed herself with batons. When Tage and Tamsin entered the ship through the hatch, she knocked them out cold.\n\nWhile navigating her way to the bridge to disable the tractor beam, Tano encountered her old friend R2-D2 in the engine room. R2-D2 told her that he now worked for a senator and that Tage and Tamsin had been sent on a mission to take her to meet someone. The droid also confirmed that the senator was the Jedi sympathizer Bail Organa and that he had indeed sent the pilots to pick her up. Tano convinced R2-D2 to release the tractor beam on her ship and to tell everyone that he never saw her. However, she instructed him to make sure that she could track his ship. After repairing her ship, Tano left Tage's ship and hid on one of the small moons that orbited the planet where she had encountered the Black Sun agent. After R2-D2 had transmitted the coordinates of Tage's ship, she slept aboard her freighter.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Planning her return to Raada\n\nTano agreed to the mission, but requested a meal since she was exhausted from her earlier adventures. Organa then informed her that his contacts in Raada's sector had reported the presence of a new Imperial agent who had gray skin and was armed with a lightsaber; this agent being the Sixth Brother, who had been stalking Hedala and was now charged with rooting out Tano. The Inquisitor had already attacked the Raadian insurgents who had retreated to the caves, recapturing Kaeden before slaughtering the others, including Kolvin and Neera. Only Miara had survived the massacre.\n\nTano opined that the new Imperial agent was a Force wielder who had been sent by the Empire to hunt down Jedi. She traced the Inquisitor's arrival to Imperial interest in her \"acts of kindness\" in the local sector. Senator Organa cautioned Tano that the Empire could be setting a trap for her. While studying footage of the Imperial agent on Organa's datapad, Tano discovered that her friend Kaeden had been captured and was bound to a chair. Tano panicked, but Organa firmly told her to calm down. He stressed that she needed to rest and plan. Organa also assured her that the Empire would not hurt Kaeden because they wanted to lure her out of hiding. In the Tantive IV's hangar bay, Tano reflected on her upcoming mission with R2-D2.\n\nWhen Captain Antilles entered the office to investigate Tano's intrusion, Organa reassured him that she was a friend. After her conversation with the senator, Tano rested in a room that Organa had provided for her. While sleeping, she experienced a flashback of her acquiring her kyber crystal as a youngling on Ilum. After resting, Tano assembled two lightsaber hilts from the scrap metal pieces she had acquired over time. Tano then met with Senator Organa and told him about her plan for their mission to Raada.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Return to Raada\n\nPrior to departing for Raada, Tano declined Organa's offer to provide a starship as she felt that the models would stand out in the Outer Rim. She also refused backup since she preferred to work alone, which Organa recalled that many of the Jedi he had encountered preferred as well, although Tano reiterated that she was not a Jedi. When Organa asked what Tano was, stating that she still sounded and acted like a Jedi, Tano replied that she would let him know once she figured out who she was. After finishing the modifications to her ship, Tano rested before departing on her mission.\n\nOn the way to Raada, Tano traveled past the planet Ilum, jumping out of hyperspace far from the world as she suspected that others might be present. She quickly discovered Imperial ships above Ilum, as well as large chunks mined from the planet. Angered at what the Empire had done to the world, Tano considered the possibility of attacking an Imperial mining ship, but remembered that Raada was her priority. Tano also considered going back to Rex's fake grave to retrieve her lightsabers, but decided against it as they had been left there intentionally to be discovered. She then reached out in the Force to find a crystal, locating one which was singing to her through the Force from Raada.\n\nAfter arriving on Raada, Tano parked her ship on the opposite side of the moon from the main settlement, knowing that there would likely be scanners that could trace her vessel near the settlement. After loading her weapons into a small carry bag, Tano walked for two hours to the Raada settlement. On the way, she found Miara sitting alone by a small fire. Tano learned that Miara was the lone survivor after the Sixth Brother had taken Kaeden prisoner and murdered the other farmers hiding in the caves. Tano convinced Miara to douse the fire and keep watch while she meditated in the Force. While meditating, Tano decided that while she was no longer a Jedi, she would still use her Jedi training to help the people to fight back against the Empire.\n\nAs they approached the settlement, Tano discovered that the Imperial crops had drained the life out of the planet's soil. She told Miara to remind her to burn the dying fields if they got a chance. Miara also informed Tano that the Empire was having the farmers work shifts for the entire daytime. While Tano headed to the Imperial compound, she instructed Miara to find Selda or Vartan and give them the holo she had recorded in hyperspace.\n\nWhile approaching the Imperial compound, Tano heard the Sixth Brother's call her out. The Inquisitor taunted her about her friendship with Kaeden, mocking her for violating the Jedi Code by forming attachments. Tano then detected him as he leapt down to attack her with his double-bladed spinning lightsaber. She dodged the Sixth Brother's attacks using the Force, the Inquisitor finding her endurance impressive. Stormtroopers lined up at the walls of the compound, forcing Tano to draw the fight into a side street to flee from the line of fire. As Tano continued to study the Sixth Brother, she asked what he was and what made him like he was. The Inquisitor stated that he served the Empire.\n\nTano used the Force to throw the Sixth Brother off balance but he stepped back towards her. She reached out and held his lightsaber, despite the Inquisitor trying to disconnect his weapon and fight her with two separate sabers. Tano managed to nick the power connection in the lightsabers hilt, causing it to overload. As she then jumped back to safety, the hilt exploded on him, leaving the Sixth Brother dead and ridden with burns. Tano felt pity for her fallen foe and closed his helmet as a mark of compassion. She then retrieved the kyber crystals from his lightsaber and used the Force to heal them of the dark side presence, causing them to turn white.\n\nArmed with her new pair of white lightsabers, Tano Force-jumped into the Imperial compound and made her way past the stormtrooper sentries to Kaeden's cell, deflecting blaster shots. Fighting through the corridors, Tano managed to open the doors to all of the cells, freeing all of the prisoners in the process. Kaeden reunited with Tano, and the pair headed to Selda's cantina. When Kaeden asked about Tano's plan, Selda reassured them that Miara had transmitted Tano's message and that Vartan was evacuating the farmers. Tano told the farmers that she had contacted an \"old friend.\" In response, Kaeden said that she understood that Tano had lied to keep them safe while the Inquisitor had lied because he enjoyed suffering. After treating Kaeden's injuries, Tano exited the cantina to find several of Organa's A-wings bombing the Imperial compound.\n\nShortly thereafter, Organa landed several transports and cargo ships, which proceeded to evacuate the farmers. Tano led Kaeden, Selda, and Miara to the Tantive IV. When Captain Antilles told her they had to evacuate soon, Tano responded that Organa's A-wings had already taken care of the Imperial fighters. After seeing to the evacuation of the Larte sisters, Tano aided the evacuation of the remaining farmers, who numbered fewer than a hundred. Three Imperial tanks then appeared and opened fire on the ships and civilians. Using her Force powers, Tano jumped onto the leading tank and cut off its cannon with her lightsaber. She then opened the hatched and hauled the pilot out. Tano then destroyed the tank's controls and overloaded the cannon.\n\nThe resulting explosion toppled the nearby tank, disabling its hover mechanism. Tano sliced off its gun and let it crash into a house. Tano then headed to the third tank, but was unable to stop it from blasting Vartan and a group of refugees. Enraged, Tano used the Force to cause the tank's turret to implode. Tano then tended to the wounded Vartan and carried him to the Tantive IV. After evacuating the last of the refugees, Tano and her rebel allies departed in their ships. Once aboard, Tano comforted the wounded Kaeden. When Kaeden moaned that she should not have listened to her feelings, Tano reassured her that Jedi made that mistake. Tano expressed confidence that she would be able to handle the galaxy now and promised to meet Kaeden again.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Virus outbreak on Naboo[]\n\nWhen the Separatist-allied Doctor Nuvo Vindi was discovered to be resurrecting the fatal Blue Shadow Virus in a laboratory on the planet Naboo, Rex was sent with Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, and the clone units Snow Wolves, Calm Tree, and Wildfire to shut down Vindi's facility. Once Tano breached the underground lab with explosives, Rex and his men joined her in drawing the attention of the battle droid defenses so that Skywalker and Kenobi could infiltrate the lab from other locations without resistance. From an LAAT/i gunship, Rex and his men rappelled into one of the ruptured tunnels and followed Tano in cutting through a patrol of B1 and B2 battle droids. However, the arrival of two droidekas halted their charge, forcing them to retreat while returning the droids' fire. As their men fell one by one, Rex and Tano were saved by Kenobi and the clone bomb squad, who collapsed part of the roof on the droidekas. Rex and his two remaining troopers followed Tano and Kenobi to a junction, where they decided to split up upon encountering more droids: Kenobi took the bomb squad to find Vindi's virus bombs\u2014which Vindi had designed to spread the Blue Shadow Virus to key Republic star systems\u2014while Rex, Tano, and their squad stayed behind to engage the droids.\n\nShortly thereafter, Vindi remotely activated the virus bombs. Once Rex and Tano had defeated the battle droids, they ran into Skywalker, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and Representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo\u2014the latter two of whom had been captured by Vindi before Skywalker rescued them\u2014at another junction. Skywalker informed Rex and Tano that one of the active bombs was missing and ordered them to split up and find Vindi's LEP servant droid, LEP-86C8, who, as Amidala recalled, had taken the bomb. While Tano and Rex searched for the bomb, Skywalker and Kenobi chased down Vindi before the scientist could escape from Naboo. When Amidala reported that she and Binks had retrieved the missing bomb from LEP-86C8 in the arboretum, Tano and Rex quickly brought the bomb squad to deactivate it. The ordnance specialists finished disabling all of the virus bombs with only seconds to spare, much to the relief of Rex and the others. Meanwhile, Skywalker and Kenobi apprehended Vindi and left to escort him to Naboo's capital, Theed, for trial. Unbeknownst to the Republic forces, LEP-86C8 had removed the virus vial from the last bomb before escaping. The droid used a spare explosive in the bomb room to release the Blue Shadow Virus into the laboratory.\n\nRex was on patrol elsewhere in the lab with Tano and several troopers when LEP-86C8 detonated the virus bomb, and they rushed for a safe room before the airborne virus could catch up to them. They were nearly sealed out of the safe room when its blast doors were triggered, but Tano held the doors open with the Force, allowing Rex and the other soldiers to jump through the crack. They in turn pried open the doors long enough for Tano to clear the jump. However, they discovered that some of the virus had entered the safe room, exposing them to the plague. Despite being infected, Rex believed that they could still contain the laboratory's remaining battle droids\u2014in total numbering over a hundred\u2014before they broke out and released the virus to Naboo's surface, even if such an act would be his last. Soon, Amidala and Binks, clad in enviro-suits, let them out of the safe room, dismayed that they could not do anything to help their infected comrades. After offering a DC-15S to Amidala, Rex joined Tano and another trooper in cutting off the battle droids from the bunker's north corridor, while Amidala, Binks, and the other troops took the south passage. They met halfway at an exit hatch, where Rex helped Amidala gun down the last battle droid attempting to cut through the hatch.\n\nOver the next six hours, Rex and his comrades continued through the compound. When they were faced with a pair of droidekas, Rex and the others provided covering fire for Tano as she charged at and engaged the droids. Although Tano finished off the droidekas, Amidala's enviro-suit was breached in the ambush, and she was consequently infected with the virus. Nevertheless, Amidala remained committed to eradicating the Separatist forces. Rex and the others did not stop until they had rooted out and eliminated the last of the droids, completing their objective within thirty hours\u2014by which point, four clone troopers besides Rex had been exposed to the virus. As the disease took its toll, Rex aided Amidala in tending to the other infected soldiers. While Amidala lamented the clones' wasted lives, Rex replied that it was what they had been born to do. Tano thereafter fainted from the virus's effects, and Rex caught her as she collapsed.\n\nMeanwhile, Skywalker and Kenobi collected a sample of reeksa root\u2014a cure for the Blue Shadow Virus\u2014from the planet Iego and returned to Naboo. They thus neutralized the virus with the antidote, just in time to save their friends. Expected to make a full recovery, Rex and the other afflicted were placed on mobile stretchers and brought onto the complex's landing pad, where 2-1B medical droids ushered them onto waiting LAAT/i gunships. Before departing, the ailing Rex made it clear to Kenobi that he did not intend to help train Binks, whom Amidala had recommended for blaster training. Rex later healed and returned to fighting shape. For his part in protecting the Naboo people from the virus, Naboo's Theed Arms gifted Rex with a set of specially chromium-plated blaster pistols dubbed the \"Vigilance\" and \"Negotiator.\"\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - From Quell to Maridun[]\n\nWhile stationed aboard the Resolute, Rex accompanied Skywalker, Tano, and Yularen to aid Jedi General Aayla Secura, whose fleet was being ambushed by Confederate forces in the Quell system. By the time the Resolute arrived over Quell, two of Secura's Star Destroyers had fallen to a fleet of Munificent-class frigates; only Secura's command ship, the Liberty, was maintaining altitude. As the Separatists launched jetpack-equipped B2-RP battle droids to board the Liberty, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano took several LAAT/i gunships with troops from the 501st Legion to evacuate Secura and her 327th Star Corps personnel from her crippled flagship. After Skywalker reached the cruiser ahead of the others, a B2-RP battle droid intercepted the gunship carrying Rex and Tano, who pulled their clone trooper pilot to safety in the troop bay after the battle droid forced him out of the cockpit. The droid also sabotaged the gunship's controls, plunging the craft uncontrollably toward Secura's flagship. As soon as they crashed through the Liberty's hull, Rex, Tano, and their squad jumped out of the burning transport without pause and began sprinting through the cruiser's corridors, disabling droids on their way to rendezvous with Skywalker and Secura.\n\nRex and Tano caught up with Skywalker, Secura, and Marshal Commander CC-5052, nicknamed \"Bly,\" in one of the Liberty's hallways, and they headed to the ventral hangar to escape aboard a Consular-class cruiser that Skywalker had called in. As the gangway was extended to the frigate, the Confederate fleet's intensifying cannonades caused an inferno to rage through the Liberty. Sacrificing himself, Skywalker Force-pushed Rex and the others into the airlock, sealing the blast doors shut in both directions, then used the Force to hold back the advancing flames. Despite his efforts, the inferno finally blasted through, throwing him against the airlock. Once Tano and Secura had brought the wounded Skywalker aboard, Bly and a co-pilot detached their Consular-class cruiser from the Liberty. Just as Bly was docking their frigate to the Resolute, a Vulture droid attack inadvertently activated the frigate's hyperdrive. Although the Resolute maneuvered away in time, the frigate jumped to hyperspace with the Jedi, clone officers, and other troop evacuees aboard.\n\nWhile Skywalker was treated in the medbay, Bly discovered that the navigation computer's incorrectly inputted coordinates had locked them on a collision course with a star in the Maridun system. Rex and Bly joined Secura and Tano on the bridge, and they decided to disengage the hyperdrive by shutting down all primary power units so that they could avoid colliding with the star. With Tano at the controls, Secura deactivated the frigate's power, bringing them out of hyperspace. Due to the vessel's uncontrollable speed and the lack of artificial gravity, Rex lost his grip on the back of Tano's seat and was smashed against Secura, breaking her hold on the power switch. Secura telekinetically reactivated the switch, enabling Tano to pilot the frigate out of its collision course with the star. Yet she could not stop the ship from heading toward the nearby planet Maridun. The frigate suffered damage while entering the planet's atmosphere before finally crash-landing. Rex, Bly, and the clones escaped first, and Rex helped another trooper out of the frigate while Tano and Secura jumped out with Skywalker, just before the ship exploded. Once they had erected a makeshift shelter for Skywalker from the wreckage, Secura, Tano, and Bly took their only surviving troopers\u2014Cameron, Lucky, and Flash\u2014to seek out medical aid for Skywalker while Rex stayed to watch over him. Before Tano left with the others, Rex assured her that he would take good care of her wounded Master and also wished her luck.",

To avoid drawing Imperial attention, Tano claimed that she had repaired the Fardis' ship and taken it for a spin around the system. The Fardi patriarch vouched for \"Ashla\" and claimed that she was his mechanic. Tano also spoke with Hedala and learned that she had sensed no \"shadows\" that day. When the stormtroopers and their commanding officer asked about the metal pieces they had found in her room, Tano claimed that they were just \"bits of junk\" that she had picked up from doing various jobs. The Imperials accepted her story but advised Fardi to be careful about associating with criminal elements.\n\nAfter the stormtroopers had left, Fardi apologized for getting Tano entangled in his family's activities. He confided that he was aware that she had been using the ships to run her own mercy missions. While appreciating her services as a mechanic and pilot, Fardi advised Tano to leave to avoid further entanglements with the Empire. Without outright telling Fardi that his youngest daughter Hedala was Force sensitive, Tano told him that she was special and to be careful with her, although Fardi understood the deeper meaning of her statement. Thinking that Hedala had potential to be a Jedi, disguising the word by saying \"mechanic,\" Fardi promised to protect his youngest daughter. Before leaving, Tano hugged Hedala and told her to avoid the \"shadows.\" The Fardis allowed her to leave in her ship.",

        "content": "# Rex - Further campaigns[]\n\nRex was sent with Skywalker and Tano to the planet Taronda to secure raw materials that the Republic desperately needed. However, Taronda's resources were also of interest to the Separatists, who targeted a mining settlement on the world to divert the Republic's attention. With Vulture droid starfighters attacking from overhead, Skywalker had Rex gather the miners and prepare the encampment's deflector shield. Though Tano fell down a crevice leading to a mineshaft, Rex informed Skywalker of a more pressing matter: the arrival of a Separatist assault force composed of a C-9979 troopship, Multi-Troop Transports, and multiple Armored Assault Tanks. After bringing the wounded civilians to safety, Rex triggered the shield and called in Republic reinforcements. Asajj Ventress materialized just beyond the shield and revealed that she had sent dwarf spider droids after Tano, but Rex told Skywalker to have faith in his Padawan and restrained him from confronting Ventress. She withdrew her droid forces from Taronda upon discovering that a Republic Star Destroyer was inbound. Rex thereafter deemed it safe to disable the shield, and Tano, who had defeated the spider droids on her own, soon rejoined him and Skywalker.\n\nWhen the Republic Ninth Fleet received a distress call from the Deyvus, a malfunctioning merchant starship locked on course with an unstable nebula, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano were sent to rescue the ship aboard the Twilight, as their craft was the nearest and fastest one available. On approach to the Deyvus, Rex noted that the damage appeared to be severe, with its ion drive gone critical and it's stabilizers offline. As they prepared to send R2-D2 to access the Deyvus's maintenance systems, the vessel revealed a number of battle droid\u2013manned laser cannons, leading Rex, Skywalker, and Tano to realize that it was a Separatist trap. Before they could maneuver the Twilight out of range, the droids targeted its engines; Rex used a fire extinguisher to put out the accompanying flames in the cockpit. He informed Skywalker that another impact would cripple the Twilight, as its hull could not withstand further damage. While the Twilight began to be pulled toward the collapsing nebula, General Grievous holographically contacted Rex, Skywalker, and Tano and lured them aboard the Deyvus, from where he claimed to be watching their deaths. Skywalker had R2-D2 begin repairing the Twilight's engines and took Rex with him to the Deyvus to capture Grievous.\n\nRex and Skywalker used a pair of grappling hooks to pull themselves toward the Deyvus through the void of space. Along the way, Rex questioned the boldness of their plan, to which Skywalker replied that it was boldness that distinguished them from the Separatists. Sneaking past the heavy laser cannons, Rex and Skywalker boarded the gun deck and proceeded into the Deyvus's system of hallways. Before they could get far, B1 battle droids and shielded droidekas surrounded them. Skywalker responded by slicing a hole in an adjacent wall with his lightsaber to blaze a detour to the bridge, where they assumed Grievous was sequestered. They passed through three floors, eliminating all of the battle droids in their path. On the bridge, they discovered that Grievous was not aboard the Deyvus; instead, a plethora of primed thermal detonators greeted them. Grievous contacted them from the safety of a Separatist cruiser and taunted their predictability before severing the connection.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Return to the Fardis\n\nTano's presence on Raada drew the attention of both the Galactic Empire and Senator Organa, who was still working against the Empire in secret. While the Empire dispatched the Inquisitor Sixth Brother to Raada to draw the Jedi out of hiding, Organa took an interest in reports of Jedi activity on Raada and contacted Captain Raymus Antilles to retrieve R2-D2 for a secret mission to find Tano. After retrieving R2-D2, Organa hired the pilots Chardri Tage and Tamsin to find Tano and then contact him to arrange a rendezvous. Organa believed that the former Jedi would make a worthy ally in the rebel movement he was building.\n\nAfter traveling through seven Outer Rim systems and hearing reports about Imperial oppression on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, Tano decided to returned to Thabeska in order to check on the Force-sensitive Hedala Fardi. Upon landing in the Fardi shipyard, Tano was greeted by the Fardi patriarch who told her that she was always welcome to work as a mechanic for his family. The Fardi patriarch also told Tano that his daughters missed her and invited her for dinner. Tano was greeted by the now five-year old Hedala, who confided that she had sensed a \"shadow\" while Tano was away. Before the togruta could ask about this, though, the Fardi cousins gathered around her, expressing their joy of her safety. Tano then allowed the cousins to each hug her, and when she parted with them, the Jedi told Hedala that the girl would need to tell her about the \"shadow\" but no one else.\n\nWhile having dinner, Tano chatted with the older Fardi sisters Chenna and Makala about life while taking care not to disclose her adventures on Raada. \"Ashla\" claimed that she had seen people suffering in the galaxy, but there was nothing she could do about it, adding that the people had gone into hiding when the sisters asked why she could not help them. Tano also remarked that it was difficult for her to hide since she stood out as a Togruta.\n\nOver the next five days, Tano spent her time working on a large Fardi transport, turning the engine and installing a new compressor. When she managed to find time alone with Hedala, Tano asked the little girl about the \"shadow.\" Hedala explained that she never saw the entity but could sense its presence. Hedala also mentioned that the \"shadow\" had one day mysteriously disappeared. Tano believed that this individual was a dark side creature, recalling rumors of a dark lord that served the Emperor. This \"shadow\" was actually the Sixth Brother, who had been hunting Hedala before redeploying to Raada. Tano complimented Hedala for staying out of the \"shadow\"'s way and told her not to mention the individual to her sisters. Tano then took a moment to think about that the \"shadow could really be and considered her options once again, deciding to stay with the Fardis since she was safe with them.\n\nA week later, Tano requested a new job from the Fardi patriarch, who was surprised upon this and had her prove her flying skills. Fardi then sent her to ferry supplies to the other branches of the Fardi family in the other cities on Thabeska. During her flights, Tano came to suspect that the Fardis were using her to smuggle goods. Fardi later assigned her offworld transport missions. While on a routine flight, she picked up a distress call from an escape pod. After rescuing the occupants of the pod, Tano was informed that their shuttle had been attacked by pirates, who had taken several hostages. The occupants, all humans, were part of a company that had been targeted by a rival firm competing for a large project. Tano suspected that the rival firm had colluded with the pirates to kidnap hostages in an attempt to bankrupt the company and she agreed to help the humans and rescued their companions from the pirates.",

Rex returned to Christophsis with Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, her protocol droid C-3PO, and R2-D2 to pursue Lai's leads about the new enemy partnership for the Jedi High Council. During their investigations, Amidala discovered that the Separatist Droid Army was mining for something on Christophsis, though she was unable to determine what. Amidala reported her findings to the High Council and prepared to leave Christophsis with Rex and her droids. Before they could get off-world, enemy forces shot down their ship, and Rex was injured in the subsequent crash. He, Amidala, C-3PO, and R2-D2 were imprisoned in the Separatist base, where the battle droids were conducting their mining operation. While there, they overheard their guards saying that the Confederacy was harvesting crystals from the planet core, which were to be used to power the Devastation, a newly constructed warship and the sister ship of the Malevolence.\n\nSkywalker and Kenobi\u2014who had been sent with Clone Commander CC-1004, nicknamed \"Gree,\" to rescue Amidala\u2014soon freed Rex and his friends from their prison cell. While C-3PO and R2-D2 remained behind to assist in the Jedi's continuing investigation, Amidala helped Rex to Gree's LAAT/i gunship, which had a medical console on standby for him. The Jedi later destroyed the Devastation before it could assault Coruscant, killing the Nightsister leader, Sai Sircu, and terminating her alliance with Dooku and the Confederacy.",

Rex soon caught sight of Durd's inbound battle group from the village's perimeter. In spite of protest from Kaa, Rex and his comrades formed a seedpod barrier to protect the village from the imminent engagement with Durd, working in teams to haul the seedpods in front of the settlement. Once Bly and Tano had moved the shield generators into place, Rex noted that Durd's battle droids were holding position a considerable distance away; Skywalker theorized that Durd would attempt to use his long-range artillery before mounting a charge. Sure enough, Durd had his droids fire a Defoliator shell, but the deflector shield proved effective in repelling the wave of destruction. Unable to do anything from afar, Durd sent in his first squad. While Skywalker, Tano, and Secura waded into the enemy ranks, Rex and Bly, remaining in front of the shield, provided covering fire with their DC-15A blaster rifles. Although they defeated the first wave of droids, the second wave\u2014comprising Durd's second and third squads\u2014swiftly followed.\n\nDue to their superior numbers, numerous battle droids slipped past the three Jedi, forcing Rex and Bly to retreat behind the seedpod barrier. Despite the clones' efforts, the droids breached both the deflector shield and the seedpod wall and marched into the village, eliminating the shield generators. Secura and Tano joined Rex and Bly in defending the Lurmen, while Skywalker disabled the Defoliator Deployment Tank and captured Durd. Aided by Too and several other Lurmen, who sacrificed their pacifist upbringings to repel the invaders from their colony, Rex and his comrades eradicated the battle droids, preventing them from demolishing the village. With the battle over, Rex and Bly ushered the captured Durd and his Aqualish aide, Pune Zignat, into the Sheathipede-class shuttle. Too thanked the group for their efforts, as did Kaa, who nonetheless questioned the cost of the victory.

        "content": "# Rex - War on Orto Plutonia[]\n\nWhen the Republic lost contact with Glid Station, a base on Orto Plutonia, Rex went with Skywalker, Kenobi, and a detail of cold assault troops to investigate the lack of response. They were accompanied by Chairman Chi Cho and Senator Riyo Chuchi from the orbiting moon of Pantora, which claimed the ice world as a protectorate due to its lack of sentient life. Upon arrival over Orto Plutonia aboard the Resolute, Rex, Skywalker, Kenobi, and the Pantoran dignitaries proceeded to Glid Station aboard a landing force of LAAT/i gunships. Rex and his men were forced to use cold assault armor that, while necessary for protection from the icy conditions, heavily restricted their movements in battle. After landing at the base and having his men place sensor beacons to survey the area, Rex followed Kenobi inside, where they discovered that the clone troopers within had been slaughtered, though there was no evidence of a battle with Separatist droids. Following their scouts' discovery of a nearby Confederate base, Rex took several troopers aboard Freeco bikes to examine the facility with Skywalker and Kenobi.\n\nAt the enemy outpost, which was composed of two connected XT Beetle Transports, Rex assisted Skywalker in placing sensors around the building before entering the complex with his general. Sorting through the communication records in the control center, Kenobi uncovered a holorecording of a large life form attacking a B1 battle droid. While Skywalker and Kenobi speculated as to what had attacked the droid, Rex reported that the droids' log indicated that it had last been scouting the southern canyon. He returned to Glid Station with the other troopers while Skywalker and Kenobi followed up on the lead. As a storm brewed outside, the Jedi returned with news of their discovery\u2014contrary to the findings of previous scouting parties, sentient life inhabited Orto Plutonia: a colony of the Talz species. Upon learning of the Talz, Cho sought to preserve Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia and immediately ordered Rex to prepare his troops for battle with the Talz, but both Skywalker and Kenobi intervened and told him that they had arranged a meeting with the Talz to negotiate peace, much to Cho's chagrin. As the Republic forces prepared to leave for the rendezvous, Rex reported to Skywalker that their gunships would not be able to take off in the storm. Skywalker ordered the rest of the clone platoon to remain at Glid Station\u2014despite Cho's aggressive claim to Orto Plutonia, the Jedi did not intend to go to war with the Talz.\n\nRex set off with Cho, Chuchi, Skywalker, Kenobi, and their clone troops for the Confederate base, which was to serve as the neutral meeting ground with the Talz. Once there, Cho told Rex to position his men on a nearby ridge from which to ambush the Talz, but Kenobi countermanded the order, as the Talz had already arrived. Leaving Rex and the clone troopers outside with an explicit directive to avoid provoking the Talz, the Jedi and Pantorans entered into negotiations with Chieftain Thi-Sen. Despite the efforts of all other parties to prevent armed conflict, Cho declared war on the Talz in an effort to expunge them from Orto Plutonia, with no one present holding sufficient political authority to revoke his decision. While Skywalker, Kenobi, and Chuchi returned to Glid Station to determine a solution for the hostilities, Rex and his men took Freeco bikes and BARC speeders to accompany and protect Cho. When they encountered several narglatch-mounted Talz scouts near an ice ridge, Cho ordered the clones to open fire on the spot. Although Rex reminded Cho that they were only there for his protection, not to fight his crusade against the Talz, the captain and his troops were forced into battle when more Talz appeared and ambushed them. After a Talz warrior and his narglatch forced him out of his Freeco swoop, Rex retaliated by gunning down his attackers. He kicked over his bike for cover, ordering his men to do the same to form a defensive perimeter around Cho and his bodyguards from the Pantoran Guard.",

Though Cho refused to pull back, one of the spears soon hit him, impaling him through the back. Acting with celerity, Rex slammed a BARC speeder into an advancing Talz and defended the wounded chairman from more of the warriors, doing his best to fend off Cho's attackers. He carried Cho onto a spare speeder and joined the rest of his men in their retreat. Yet further on, the collapse of an ice bridge across a gorge compromised their only path to safety. Despite being trapped between the ravine and the line of Talz warriors, Rex was ready to fight to the last man. As spears began to fly, he signaled the few survivors of his unit to use their vehicles as cover from the charging Talz. They countered the Talz's spears with blasterfire until Skywalker, Kenobi, and Chuchi presently landed at their position with several LAAT/i gunships and troop reinforcements.\n\nThough the Talz were forced to halt their offensive, both they and the clone troopers had suffered devastating casualties. After Cho, who remained determined to eradicate the Talz to his last breath, succumbed to his injuries and died, Chuchi\u2014having received proper jurisdiction from the Pantoran Assembly\u2014negotiated an end to the bloodshed with Thi-Sen.

        "content": "# Rex - From Quell to Maridun[]\n\nWhile stationed aboard the Resolute, Rex accompanied Skywalker, Tano, and Yularen to aid Jedi General Aayla Secura, whose fleet was being ambushed by Confederate forces in the Quell system. By the time the Resolute arrived over Quell, two of Secura's Star Destroyers had fallen to a fleet of Munificent-class frigates; only Secura's command ship, the Liberty, was maintaining altitude. As the Separatists launched jetpack-equipped B2-RP battle droids to board the Liberty, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano took several LAAT/i gunships with troops from the 501st Legion to evacuate Secura and her 327th Star Corps personnel from her crippled flagship. After Skywalker reached the cruiser ahead of the others, a B2-RP battle droid intercepted the gunship carrying Rex and Tano, who pulled their clone trooper pilot to safety in the troop bay after the battle droid forced him out of the cockpit. The droid also sabotaged the gunship's controls, plunging the craft uncontrollably toward Secura's flagship. As soon as they crashed through the Liberty's hull, Rex, Tano, and their squad jumped out of the burning transport without pause and began sprinting through the cruiser's corridors, disabling droids on their way to rendezvous with Skywalker and Secura.\n\nRex and Tano caught up with Skywalker, Secura, and Marshal Commander CC-5052, nicknamed \"Bly,\" in one of the Liberty's hallways, and they headed to the ventral hangar to escape aboard a Consular-class cruiser that Skywalker had called in. As the gangway was extended to the frigate, the Confederate fleet's intensifying cannonades caused an inferno to rage through the Liberty. Sacrificing himself, Skywalker Force-pushed Rex and the others into the airlock, sealing the blast doors shut in both directions, then used the Force to hold back the advancing flames. Despite his efforts, the inferno finally blasted through, throwing him against the airlock. Once Tano and Secura had brought the wounded Skywalker aboard, Bly and a co-pilot detached their Consular-class cruiser from the Liberty. Just as Bly was docking their frigate to the Resolute, a Vulture droid attack inadvertently activated the frigate's hyperdrive. Although the Resolute maneuvered away in time, the frigate jumped to hyperspace with the Jedi, clone officers, and other troop evacuees aboard.\n\nWhile Skywalker was treated in the medbay, Bly discovered that the navigation computer's incorrectly inputted coordinates had locked them on a collision course with a star in the Maridun system. Rex and Bly joined Secura and Tano on the bridge, and they decided to disengage the hyperdrive by shutting down all primary power units so that they could avoid colliding with the star. With Tano at the controls, Secura deactivated the frigate's power, bringing them out of hyperspace. Due to the vessel's uncontrollable speed and the lack of artificial gravity, Rex lost his grip on the back of Tano's seat and was smashed against Secura, breaking her hold on the power switch. Secura telekinetically reactivated the switch, enabling Tano to pilot the frigate out of its collision course with the star. Yet she could not stop the ship from heading toward the nearby planet Maridun. The frigate suffered damage while entering the planet's atmosphere before finally crash-landing. Rex, Bly, and the clones escaped first, and Rex helped another trooper out of the frigate while Tano and Secura jumped out with Skywalker, just before the ship exploded. Once they had erected a makeshift shelter for Skywalker from the wreckage, Secura, Tano, and Bly took their only surviving troopers\u2014Cameron, Lucky, and Flash\u2014to seek out medical aid for Skywalker while Rex stayed to watch over him. Before Tano left with the others, Rex assured her that he would take good care of her wounded Master and also wished her luck.\n\nRex diligently guarded Skywalker through the night. When Skywalker finally awoke and tried to get up, Rex ran over and checked on his condition. However, a carnivorous mastiff phalone that had been watching the two for hours attacked Rex, pinning him and trapping his blaster hand under one of its claws. Rex managed to fire a shot, startling the creature and scaring it away, and aimed several final blasts at its retreating form. Skywalker fell back asleep and did not reawaken until the next morning. When he did, Rex insisted that he maintain his rest, but Skywalker told him that he could hear the mastiff phalones returning. Both of them drew their weapons just as two of the creatures arrived and attacked. Rex gunned one of the beasts down, but the other charged into the makeshift shelter, knocking both him and Skywalker aside. At that moment, Tano and Bly returned with Wag Too, a healer from Maridun's village of Lurmen colonists. Too wrapped a rope around the feet of the remaining mastiff phalone, and Tano assisted Too\u2014as did Rex, despite an arm injury\u2014in tugging on the rope to topple the creature. Once it had fallen to the ground, Too secured the rope around its legs, preventing it from inflicting further harm. Rex then followed Tano, Bly, and Too back to the Lurmen village, with Skywalker in tow on a stretcher cobbled together from the shelter's remains.\n\nWhile the Lurmen tended to Skywalker's wounds, Rex kept watch on the outskirts of the settlement. During his shift, he noticed the arrival of a Confederate troopship and reported it to Bly, who was back at the colony with the Jedi and ordered him to return. Rex joined the others in the seedpod hut where Skywalker was being treated. Given that Maridun was a neutral world, the Jedi and clones decided to abscond before the Separatists found them so as to ensure that the Lurmen did not suffer for hosting them. Rex and Bly aided Skywalker and, with Tano and Secura following behind, made for a nearby field of tall grass behind the village. While there, Rex and Tano discussed the Lurmen's pacifism, denouncing the colonists as cowardly until Secura intervened and asserted that it took courage to follow one's beliefs. When Skywalker suggested that they pilfer a shuttle from the Confederacy to escape off-world, Rex agreed with his Jedi General, eager to steal from the Separatists. Tano then noticed that a Separatist recon droid was spying on them. Rex joined her and Bly in pursuing the probe droid, but it was Secura who disabled the probe by maneuvering in front of it through the grasses. Searching for the probe's origin from atop a nearby tree, Rex and his comrades discovered the Separatists' base and watched as General Lok Durd held a test run of his Defoliator, an experimental cannon capable of liquidating organic matter while leaving mechanical units unharmed.\n\nAs Rex and Bly moved in for a closer look at the Defoliator, Durd sent two B1 battle droids\u2014inadvertently, in the direction of the approaching clone troopers\u2014to serve as test subjects. When the Defoliator Deployment Tank fired a capsule at the battle droids' location, it birthed an expanding wave of fire that decimated all life in the area, flora or otherwise. Rex and Bly turned and fled for higher ground, firing their blasters' ascension cables at the tree. Rex made it to safety, and though Bly tripped and misfired his cable, Secura swung down on a vine and pulled him to refuge. They watched as Durd departed with several squads of troops, and Skywalker concluded that Durd intended to test the Defoliator on the Lurmen village. Rex and the others resolved to protect the Lurmen, waiting until after nightfall to raid the Separatist base for a starship. Once Rex, Skywalker, and Bly had cut down the droid guards outside the facility, Tano and Secura opened the door, enabling the others to infiltrate the base. Using various crates as cover, Rex, Skywalker, and Bly reached the communication center and destroyed the droids in command. Rex noticed a pair of mobile shield generators and, at Skywalker's behest, helped Bly bring them aboard the Sheathipede-class shuttle that the Jedi had commandeered.\n\nWhen Rex and the others landed at the Lurmen village at daybreak, the Lurmen chieftain, Tee Watt Kaa, did not appreciate their return, as he believed that they had brought the Clone Wars to Maridun. Rex soon caught sight of Durd's inbound battle group from the village's perimeter. In spite of protest from Kaa, Rex and his comrades formed a seedpod barrier to protect the village from the imminent engagement with Durd, working in teams to haul the seedpods in front of the settlement. Once Bly and Tano had moved the shield generators into place, Rex noted that Durd's battle droids were holding position a considerable distance away; Skywalker theorized that Durd would attempt to use his long-range artillery before mounting a charge.

While Skywalker, Tano, and Secura waded into the enemy ranks, Rex and Bly, remaining in front of the shield, provided covering fire with their DC-15A blaster rifles. Although they defeated the first wave of droids, the second wave\u2014comprising Durd's second and third squads\u2014swiftly followed.\n\nDue to their superior numbers, numerous battle droids slipped past the three Jedi, forcing Rex and Bly to retreat behind the seedpod barrier.

Too thanked the group for their efforts, as did Kaa, who nonetheless questioned the cost of the victory.

        "content": "# Rex - War on Orto Plutonia[]\n\nWhen the Republic lost contact with Glid Station, a base on Orto Plutonia, Rex went with Skywalker, Kenobi, and a detail of cold assault troops to investigate the lack of response. They were accompanied by Chairman Chi Cho and Senator Riyo Chuchi from the orbiting moon of Pantora, which claimed the ice world as a protectorate due to its lack of sentient life. Upon arrival over Orto Plutonia aboard the Resolute, Rex, Skywalker, Kenobi, and the Pantoran dignitaries proceeded to Glid Station aboard a landing force of LAAT/i gunships. Rex and his men were forced to use cold assault armor that, while necessary for protection from the icy conditions, heavily restricted their movements in battle. After landing at the base and having his men place sensor beacons to survey the area, Rex followed Kenobi inside, where they discovered that the clone troopers within had been slaughtered, though there was no evidence of a battle with Separatist droids. Following their scouts' discovery of a nearby Confederate base, Rex took several troopers aboard Freeco bikes to examine the facility with Skywalker and Kenobi.\n\nAt the enemy outpost, which was composed of two connected XT Beetle Transports, Rex assisted Skywalker in placing sensors around the building before entering the complex with his general. Sorting through the communication records in the control center, Kenobi uncovered a holorecording of a large life form attacking a B1 battle droid. While Skywalker and Kenobi speculated as to what had attacked the droid, Rex reported that the droids' log indicated that it had last been scouting the southern canyon. He returned to Glid Station with the other troopers while Skywalker and Kenobi followed up on the lead. As a storm brewed outside, the Jedi returned with news of their discovery\u2014contrary to the findings of previous scouting parties, sentient life inhabited Orto Plutonia: a colony of the Talz species. Upon learning of the Talz, Cho sought to preserve Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia and immediately ordered Rex to prepare his troops for battle with the Talz, but both Skywalker and Kenobi intervened and told him that they had arranged a meeting with the Talz to negotiate peace, much to Cho's chagrin. As the Republic forces prepared to leave for the rendezvous, Rex reported to Skywalker that their gunships would not be able to take off in the storm. Skywalker ordered the rest of the clone platoon to remain at Glid Station\u2014despite Cho's aggressive claim to Orto Plutonia, the Jedi did not intend to go to war with the Talz.\n\nRex set off with Cho, Chuchi, Skywalker, Kenobi, and their clone troops for the Confederate base, which was to serve as the neutral meeting ground with the Talz. Once there, Cho told Rex to position his men on a nearby ridge from which to ambush the Talz, but Kenobi countermanded the order, as the Talz had already arrived. Leaving Rex and the clone troopers outside with an explicit directive to avoid provoking the Talz, the Jedi and Pantorans entered into negotiations with Chieftain Thi-Sen. Despite the efforts of all other parties to prevent armed conflict, Cho declared war on the Talz in an effort to expunge them from Orto Plutonia, with no one present holding sufficient political authority to revoke his decision. While Skywalker, Kenobi, and Chuchi returned to Glid Station to determine a solution for the hostilities, Rex and his men took Freeco bikes and BARC speeders to accompany and protect Cho. When they encountered several narglatch-mounted Talz scouts near an ice ridge, Cho ordered the clones to open fire on the spot. Although Rex reminded Cho that they were only there for his protection, not to fight his crusade against the Talz, the captain and his troops were forced into battle when more Talz appeared and ambushed them. After a Talz warrior and his narglatch forced him out of his Freeco swoop, Rex retaliated by gunning down his attackers. He kicked over his bike for cover, ordering his men to do the same to form a defensive perimeter around Cho and his bodyguards from the Pantoran Guard.\n\nAs the Talz flung spears at them, Rex ordered his men to retreat. Though Cho refused to pull back, one of the spears soon hit him, impaling him through the back. Acting with celerity, Rex slammed a BARC speeder into an advancing Talz and defended the wounded chairman from more of the warriors, doing his best to fend off Cho's attackers. He carried Cho onto a spare speeder and joined the rest of his men in their retreat. Yet further on, the collapse of an ice bridge across a gorge compromised their only path to safety. Despite being trapped between the ravine and the line of Talz warriors, Rex was ready to fight to the last man. As spears began to fly, he signaled the few survivors of his unit to use their vehicles as cover from the charging Talz. They countered the Talz's spears with blasterfire until Skywalker, Kenobi, and Chuchi presently landed at their position with several LAAT/i gunships and troop reinforcements.\n\nThough the Talz were forced to halt their offensive, both they and the clone troopers had suffered devastating casualties. After Cho, who remained determined to eradicate the Talz to his last breath, succumbed to his injuries and died, Chuchi\u2014having received proper jurisdiction from the Pantoran Assembly\u2014negotiated an end to the bloodshed with Thi-Sen. She peaceably transferred control of Orto Plutonia to the Talz in recognition of their sovereign status. With the Battle of Orto Plutonia brought to an end, Rex and his men departed from the battlefield with Chuchi, Skywalker, and Kenobi aboard the gunships.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - From Quell to Maridun[]\n\nRex diligently guarded Skywalker through the night. When Skywalker finally awoke and tried to get up, Rex ran over and checked on his condition. However, a carnivorous mastiff phalone that had been watching the two for hours attacked Rex, pinning him and trapping his blaster hand under one of its claws. Rex managed to fire a shot, startling the creature and scaring it away, and aimed several final blasts at its retreating form. Skywalker fell back asleep and did not reawaken until the next morning. When he did, Rex insisted that he maintain his rest, but Skywalker told him that he could hear the mastiff phalones returning. Both of them drew their weapons just as two of the creatures arrived and attacked. Rex gunned one of the beasts down, but the other charged into the makeshift shelter, knocking both him and Skywalker aside. At that moment, Tano and Bly returned with Wag Too, a healer from Maridun's village of Lurmen colonists. Too wrapped a rope around the feet of the remaining mastiff phalone, and Tano assisted Too\u2014as did Rex, despite an arm injury\u2014in tugging on the rope to topple the creature. Once it had fallen to the ground, Too secured the rope around its legs, preventing it from inflicting further harm. Rex then followed Tano, Bly, and Too back to the Lurmen village, with Skywalker in tow on a stretcher cobbled together from the shelter's remains.\n\nWhile the Lurmen tended to Skywalker's wounds, Rex kept watch on the outskirts of the settlement. During his shift, he noticed the arrival of a Confederate troopship and reported it to Bly, who was back at the colony with the Jedi and ordered him to return. Rex joined the others in the seedpod hut where Skywalker was being treated. Given that Maridun was a neutral world, the Jedi and clones decided to abscond before the Separatists found them so as to ensure that the Lurmen did not suffer for hosting them. Rex and Bly aided Skywalker and, with Tano and Secura following behind, made for a nearby field of tall grass behind the village. While there, Rex and Tano discussed the Lurmen's pacifism, denouncing the colonists as cowardly until Secura intervened and asserted that it took courage to follow one's beliefs. When Skywalker suggested that they pilfer a shuttle from the Confederacy to escape off-world, Rex agreed with his Jedi General, eager to steal from the Separatists. Tano then noticed that a Separatist recon droid was spying on them. Rex joined her and Bly in pursuing the probe droid, but it was Secura who disabled the probe by maneuvering in front of it through the grasses. Searching for the probe's origin from atop a nearby tree, Rex and his comrades discovered the Separatists' base and watched as General Lok Durd held a test run of his Defoliator, an experimental cannon capable of liquidating organic matter while leaving mechanical units unharmed.\n\nAs Rex and Bly moved in for a closer look at the Defoliator, Durd sent two B1 battle droids\u2014inadvertently, in the direction of the approaching clone troopers\u2014to serve as test subjects. When the Defoliator Deployment Tank fired a capsule at the battle droids' location, it birthed an expanding wave of fire that decimated all life in the area, flora or otherwise. Rex and Bly turned and fled for higher ground, firing their blasters' ascension cables at the tree. Rex made it to safety, and though Bly tripped and misfired his cable, Secura swung down on a vine and pulled him to refuge. They watched as Durd departed with several squads of troops, and Skywalker concluded that Durd intended to test the Defoliator on the Lurmen village. Rex and the others resolved to protect the Lurmen, waiting until after nightfall to raid the Separatist base for a starship. Once Rex, Skywalker, and Bly had cut down the droid guards outside the facility, Tano and Secura opened the door, enabling the others to infiltrate the base. Using various crates as cover, Rex, Skywalker, and Bly reached the communication center and destroyed the droids in command. Rex noticed a pair of mobile shield generators and, at Skywalker's behest, helped Bly bring them aboard the Sheathipede-class shuttle that the Jedi had commandeered.",

Tano then surprised Senator Organa in his temporary office. After exchanging pleasantries about R2-D2, Tano explained that she did not come with Tage because she distrusted anyone who employed a tractor beam before saying a hello. Organa admitted not telling his pilots who she was in order to protect her true identity. Addressing her as \"Padawan Tano,\" Organa then told Tano that he was recruiting people for a rebellion against the Emperor, the Empire and everything it stood for.\n\nTano responded that she was no longer a Padawan and recounted the previous events on Raada to Organa. Senator Organa told her that she could not fight the Empire alone and offered her a place in the emerging rebellion. However, Tano stated that she could not become a commander again due to her experiences during the Clone Wars. Organa replied that he could find another job for her. Tano then told Organa that \"something\" was hunting down Force-sensitive children throughout the galaxy. She agreed to join the rebellion if Organa agreed to help her protect the children. Senator Organa accepted her bargain and told Tano that he needed her help for a mission on Raada.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Return to the Fardis\n\nTano's presence on Raada drew the attention of both the Galactic Empire and Senator Organa, who was still working against the Empire in secret. While the Empire dispatched the Inquisitor Sixth Brother to Raada to draw the Jedi out of hiding, Organa took an interest in reports of Jedi activity on Raada and contacted Captain Raymus Antilles to retrieve R2-D2 for a secret mission to find Tano. After retrieving R2-D2, Organa hired the pilots Chardri Tage and Tamsin to find Tano and then contact him to arrange a rendezvous. Organa believed that the former Jedi would make a worthy ally in the rebel movement he was building.\n\nAfter traveling through seven Outer Rim systems and hearing reports about Imperial oppression on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, Tano decided to returned to Thabeska in order to check on the Force-sensitive Hedala Fardi. Upon landing in the Fardi shipyard, Tano was greeted by the Fardi patriarch who told her that she was always welcome to work as a mechanic for his family. The Fardi patriarch also told Tano that his daughters missed her and invited her for dinner. Tano was greeted by the now five-year old Hedala, who confided that she had sensed a \"shadow\" while Tano was away. Before the togruta could ask about this, though, the Fardi cousins gathered around her, expressing their joy of her safety. Tano then allowed the cousins to each hug her, and when she parted with them, the Jedi told Hedala that the girl would need to tell her about the \"shadow\" but no one else.\n\nWhile having dinner, Tano chatted with the older Fardi sisters Chenna and Makala about life while taking care not to disclose her adventures on Raada. \"Ashla\" claimed that she had seen people suffering in the galaxy, but there was nothing she could do about it, adding that the people had gone into hiding when the sisters asked why she could not help them. Tano also remarked that it was difficult for her to hide since she stood out as a Togruta.\n\nOver the next five days, Tano spent her time working on a large Fardi transport, turning the engine and installing a new compressor. When she managed to find time alone with Hedala, Tano asked the little girl about the \"shadow.\" Hedala explained that she never saw the entity but could sense its presence. Hedala also mentioned that the \"shadow\" had one day mysteriously disappeared. Tano believed that this individual was a dark side creature, recalling rumors of a dark lord that served the Emperor. This \"shadow\" was actually the Sixth Brother, who had been hunting Hedala before redeploying to Raada. Tano complimented Hedala for staying out of the \"shadow\"'s way and told her not to mention the individual to her sisters. Tano then took a moment to think about that the \"shadow could really be and considered her options once again, deciding to stay with the Fardis since she was safe with them.\n\nA week later, Tano requested a new job from the Fardi patriarch, who was surprised upon this and had her prove her flying skills. Fardi then sent her to ferry supplies to the other branches of the Fardi family in the other cities on Thabeska. During her flights, Tano came to suspect that the Fardis were using her to smuggle goods. Fardi later assigned her offworld transport missions. While on a routine flight, she picked up a distress call from an escape pod. After rescuing the occupants of the pod, Tano was informed that their shuttle had been attacked by pirates, who had taken several hostages. The occupants, all humans, were part of a company that had been targeted by a rival firm competing for a large project. Tano suspected that the rival firm had colluded with the pirates to kidnap hostages in an attempt to bankrupt the company and she agreed to help the humans and rescued their companions from the pirates.\n\nLater, Tano returned to the Fardi household and discovered that stormtroopers were conducting a routine search of the house. To avoid drawing Imperial attention, Tano claimed that she had repaired the Fardis' ship and taken it for a spin around the system. The Fardi patriarch vouched for \"Ashla\" and claimed that she was his mechanic. Tano also spoke with Hedala and learned that she had sensed no \"shadows\" that day. When the stormtroopers and their commanding officer asked about the metal pieces they had found in her room, Tano claimed that they were just \"bits of junk\" that she had picked up from doing various jobs. The Imperials accepted her story but advised Fardi to be careful about associating with criminal elements.\n\nAfter the stormtroopers had left, Fardi apologized for getting Tano entangled in his family's activities. He confided that he was aware that she had been using the ships to run her own mercy missions. While appreciating her services as a mechanic and pilot, Fardi advised Tano to leave to avoid further entanglements with the Empire. Without outright telling Fardi that his youngest daughter Hedala was Force sensitive, Tano told him that she was special and to be careful with her, although Fardi understood the deeper meaning of her statement. Thinking that Hedala had potential to be a Jedi, disguising the word by saying \"mechanic,\" Fardi promised to protect his youngest daughter. Before leaving, Tano hugged Hedala and told her to avoid the \"shadows.\" The Fardis allowed her to leave in her ship.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Mandalorian affairs[]\n\nThe Mandalorian Death Watch, a terrorist splinter group allied with the Confederacy, later emerged in opposition to Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore and her dominant regime, the pacifistic New Mandalorians. With Kryze's life in danger, Rex was assigned with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody to escort Kryze to Coruscant, where she intended to reaffirm her people's position of neutrality before the Galactic Senate. Rex, Skywalker, Cody, and their clone squad met with Kenobi\u2014who had been conducting an investigation into false rumors that Kryze had joined the Confederacy\u2014at a spaceport in Mandalore's capital city, Sundari, where Kryze's starship, the Coronet, was preparing to depart. After checking in with Kenobi, Rex and his comrades joined Kryze and her entourage aboard the Coronet, which then left for Coruscant. En route to the Republic capital, Skywalker and Kenobi gathered their troops in the cargo hold for a briefing. The Jedi told the clones to stay vigilant for the Death Watch, which would stop at nothing to assassinate Kryze before she reached Coruscant. Rex and Cody sent their men to begin their rounds of the cargo bay, patrolling for any signs of danger, while Skywalker and Kenobi left to meet with Kryze.\n\nDuring their patrol, Rex and Cody bumped into R2-D2, who appeared to have been frightened by something. The two officers also found they were unable to make contact with two of their men, Mixer and Redeye. Rex contacted Kenobi, who sent Skywalker back to assist in investigating the disturbance. Bringing the rest of the squad with them, Rex and Cody followed Skywalker and R2-D2 with headlamps ablaze through the labyrinth of containers in search of Mixer and Redeye. Their focus shifted upon finding an open and overturned crate, with Skywalker ordering Rex, Cody, and their men to find the box's missing contents. The disappeared cargo manifested itself as a large assassin probe droid, which had killed Mixer and Redeye and now began to attack Skywalker. Rex and his comrades intercepted the droid during its fight with Skywalker, disabling it with blasterfire before it could crush their Jedi General with its large legs. However, a second assassin probe took advantage of their distraction to head for the turbolift shaft leading to the dining room, where Kenobi was guarding Kryze and her Senatorial colleagues. Rex and the others ran for the lift but were unable to prevent the assassin probe from climbing up to the dining room; Skywalker notified Kenobi of the impending danger via comlink.\n\nAs Skywalker speculated on the possibility that more assassin droids were aboard, the fallen assassin probe hatched an army of tiny but deadly probe killer droids. Rex, Cody, and their men opened fire on the probe killers and, despite some casualties, managed to repel the majority of the nuisances. Although Rex wondered aloud how the assassin probe had gotten aboard the Coronet, Skywalker instead focused on the more specific question of who had smuggled it aboard to assassinate Kryze. After finding the protocol droid in charge of the cargo manifest, Skywalker ascertained that someone had used a Senate stamp to approve the shipment of the crates containing the assassin droids. Acting on that lead, Kenobi launched into an interrogation of the four senators aboard the Coronet\u2014Onaconda Farr, Kin Robb, Orn Free Taa, and Tal Merrik\u2014to determine which one of them had smuggled the droids aboard, while Rex and his men joined Skywalker in scouring the cargo hold for the third and final assassin probe. While patrolling with Rex, Cody stopped to examine a trooper's abandoned helmet and became the victim of a probe killer that had been hiding inside it. Cody fell to the floor as he tried to fight off the probe killer, and when Rex tried to grab the droid off his comrade, two more of them jumped onto the captain. Both officers were saved by the timely arrival of Skywalker and R2-D2, who disabled the enemy droids with lightsaber and electric shocker, respectively.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Dealing with Morgan Elsbeth\n\nBy 9 ABY, by which point she had not seen Wren in years, Tano began hearing whispers surrounding the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn as heir to the Empire. Concerned about the idea, Tano began searching for Thrawn and followed a lead to the forested planet Corvus, looking for information on the location of the Grand Admiral. In order to obtain this information, Tano ventured to the city of Calodan, which was ruled by Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth, a servant and former apprentice of Thrawn, and her army. Bo-Katan Kryze knew of her journey to Corvus and directed the Mandalorian Din Djarin to her location in order for him to complete his quest to bring an infant of the same species as Yoda to the Jedi.\n\nWhile making her way to Calodan, Tano met great resistance and was attacked by a legion of Elsbeth's scout guards. Tano managed to overpower them and force them to retreat. As they retreated, Tano used her white lightsabers to cut down one of the guards as they retreated further towards the city gates of Calodan. Turning off her lightsabers and using the fog-filled forest to her advantage, Tano hid behind a tree and used the Force to distract the guards before reigniting her lightsabers and cutting through another one of them by slashing through a tree. In retaliation, the guards once again began firing at her with their A350 blaster rifles, leading Tano to use the Force to throw a piece of the tree she had just cut down at one of the guards, before turning off her lightsabers again, disappearing into the mist. Tano briefly emerged and cut down another guard using her lightsabers before disappearing once more as guards continued to shoot at her.\n\nSneaking behind of the guards, she cut them in half, leaving one guard remaining. As the last remaining guard attempted to retreat back to the city, Tano emerged from the mist and blocked the final guards' blaster bolts before cutting the guard down. As Tano returned to the mist, Elsbeth, from atop a sentry point on the walls surrounding Calodan, requested that Tano show herself, to which Tano obliged, lightsabers once again ignited. Elsbeth announced that she had been expecting Tano, to which she replied that she must then know what she was after. Elsbeth declared that she will learn nothing from her, but Tano bluntly stated that she will not give Elsbeth that choice.\n\nCalling up one of her HK-87 assassin droids, Elsbeth presented one of the town's inhabitants, now Elsbeth's captive, and asked how many lives Tano was willing to sacrifice to gain the information she sought. Elsbeth went on to note that the lives of the city's inhabitants meant little to her and that the people in the city would suffer because of Tano's interference. However, Tano declared that the people were already suffering under Elsbeth's rule and that Elsbeth should surrender if she did not want to face the consequences of her crimes. Raising one of her lightsabers, Tano announced that she would give Elsbeth one day to make her decision as Elsbeth disdainfully smirked at her. Extinguishing her lightsabers, Tano retreated back into the mist and away from Elsbeth.\n\nBy daybreak, Tano had retreated deep into the forest. Eventually, Tano discovered the Mandalorian Din Djarin who had been searching across the landscape for her. Seeing him as a threat, Tano lunged at him using her lightsabers; however, Djarin heard her and managed to block her lightsabers using his wrist gauntlets. As she continued to strike, Djarin managed to block each of her slashes by continuing to use his wrist gauntlets before using his flamethrower to stagger her and his whipcord launcher to immobilize her. Seeing a branch above her, Tano leapt over it, freeing her and, as the whipcord was still attached to Djarin's wrist gauntlet, dragging Djarin up with her before the whipcord snapped. Now free, Tano reignited her sabers, prepared to continue the fight before Djarin called out her name and declared that Bo-Katan had sent him, requesting to speak with the former Jedi. Noticing Djarin's foundling, a youngling of the same species as Yoda, sitting atop a rock, Tano moved out of her fighting stance and noted to Djarin that she hoped they would be talking about him.\n\nBy nightfall, she and the youngling were telepathically communicating through the Force under the light of a lantern and a moon above. Standing up, Tano picked up the youngling, who, as she had discovered through their telepathic communication, was named Grogu and raised in the Jedi Temple. Tano brought Grogu and the lantern closer to Djarin and sat down next to the youngling. Djarin asked if Grogu was speaking to her and if she understood him. To this, Tano answered that she and Grogu could feel each other's thoughts. Djarin was shocked at learning Grogu's name for the first time and questioned the name upon hearing it. Tano reaffirmed that his name was Grogu and explained to Djarin that Grogu had been raised in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and that he had been trained by many masters over his many years. However, she went on to explain that he had been hidden away by someone at the temple at the end of the Clone Wars when the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire, but, after that, his memory became clouded and he did not remember much of the years following. Continuing on, Tano explained that Grogu had felt lost and alone after the Jedi Order's collapse.\n\nMoving on from Grogu's origins, Tano explained that she had known another member of his species, Jedi Grand Master Yoda, and noted how wise he had been. Tano asked Djarin if Grogu could still wield the Force as he had done at the Jedi Temple, to which Djarin questioned if she was referring to his powers. Tano explained that the Force is what gives Grogu his powers and that the Force was an energy field created by all living things. With this, she explained that one would need to have a great deal of discipline and training in the Force such powers. Now knowing this, Djarin brought up the supposedly unexplainable things Grogu had done prior and how he had been tasked to bring Grogu to a Jedi. However, to this, Tano simply explained that the Jedi Order had fallen long ago, to which Djarin noted that even though the Empire was gone, it still hunted Grogu and that he would need her help if he was to evade them longer. With that, Tano recommended that they let Grogu sleep and that she would test his abilities in the morning.\n\nAt daybreak, Tano, Djarin, and Grogu ventured to a clearing and, when they arrived, Tano walked up to Grogu and playfully stated that they would find out what knowledge Grogu possessed. With that, Tano motioned Djarin to place Grogu down on one of the rocks, which he complied with. Grabbing a small stone, Tano used the Force to slowly levitate the stone into Grogu's hands and explained that she wished for him to return the stone to her outstretched hand. Before giving him a chance to do anything, Djarin interjected and attempted to inform Tano that Grogu didn't understand, but Tano rejected his inquiry, simply stating that Grogu could understand what she was asking of him.\n\nArm still outstretched, she told Grogu that it was ok and once again requested the stone from Grogu. However, instead of returning the stone to her using the Force, Grogu simply dropped it, leading her to lower her arm in disappointment and walk towards him. Grabbing one of his small hands, Tano used the Force to feel his emotions and calmly announced that she felt great fear in Grogu and, as she stood up and walked back to her original position, she explained to Djarin that Grogu had hidden his abilities over the years in order to conceal himself.\n\nTano then announced that she wished to try something else and asked Djarin to come over to her. Djarin misunderstood and signaled for Grogu to go to Tano instead and when he didn't move, he exclaimed that Grogu was stubborn. However, Tano quickly stopped him and informed him that she was not the one who would be performing the test but Djarin himself, explaining that she wanted to see if he would listen to him. This prompted Djarin to begin complaining about how, if Grogu would listen to him, it would be one of the first times, to which Tano jokingly told Djarin that she liked firsts, whether they be good or bad because of how memorable they were. Handing the stone to Djarin, Tano instructed him to hold the stone in the palm of his hand and to request for Grogu to lift the stone using the Force.\n\nAs Tano walked past Djarin to witness the test, Tano whispered into his ear a request for him to use Grogu's name as opposed to referring to him as \"kid\" as he had done when first requesting for him to take the stone. Walking away and leaning on a large boulder, Tano watched as Djarin requested for Grogu to take the stone once more and him giving up moments later, once again claiming Grogu was stubborn. To this, Tano instructed Djarin to try to connect with Grogu prompting Djarin to pull out a small, silver ball used on one of the levers on his gunship, the Razor Crest, which Grogu had become quite fond of. Kneeling down, Djarin asked if Grogu wanted the ball and requested for him to take it. With little hesitation, Grogu used the Force to pull the ball to him.\n\nDjarin congratulated Grogu on this, and, while doing so, Tano noted the attachment Grogu had formed with him and that she could not train him. Djarin was shocked by this and asked why she could not, citing his abilities. To this, Tano explained that his attachment to Djarin made him vulnerable to the dark side. Djarin, however, did not understand and insisted that this was even more of a reason to train Grogu, but Tano once again refused, indirectly citing her former master, Anakin Skywalker, and how his emotions had gotten the best of him, turning him to the dark side. She once again refused to allow Grogu to go down that path and said that it would be better if they just let Grogu's abilities with the Force fade as he grew older. Hurrying, Tano informed Djarin that she had waited too long and that she had to return to Calodan and save its inhabitants.\n\nAs Tano walked away, Djarin noted how Elsbeth had sent Djarin to kill her and that he had not agreed to anything of what Tano had just told him. Attempting to strike a deal, Djarin told Tano that he would assist Tano in saving Calodan if she assisted him in training Grogu. Agreeing to this, Tano and Djarin set off on their journey back to Calodan.\n\nOn their way back to Calodan, Djarin noted the forces Elsbeth had under her control, including the HK-87 assassin droids, scout guards, and her hired gunfighter, Lang, and mentioned how he believed that her lightsabers would not be able to protect her from the amount of blaster bolts that would be shot at her. In response, Tano affirmed his remark and that he should also be wary of the magistrate herself. Upon Djarin's questioning of who Elsbeth, Tano revealed her name to Djarin and that her home had been ravaged during the Clone Wars with her people massacred. Continuing on, she further explained that this developed a great anger in her, which led to her helping construct warships for the Imperial Navy and ravage worlds herself. This led Djarin to note the burned forest that surrounded them. After quickly surveying the environment, Tano asked Djarin if he had seen any prisoners within the city's walls, leading him to note the three villagers that had been taken prisoner. Tano declared that they had to find a way to free them, to which Djarin noted that Elsbeth's army would never see the pairing of the two coming.\n\nAt late dusk, the two finally completed their journey. Running at the city's entrance, Tano used the Force to leap up to the sentry point at the city's gate, igniting one of her lightsabers and kicking one of the scout guards. Blocking the blaster bolts fired at her by another scout guard, Tano grabbed the guard and flung them against a support beam of a gong, the city's alarm system, before promptly blocking the blaster bolts of another scout guard. She then threw the body of the scout guard she had grabbed prior and tossing him into the wall opposite of where he had been prior. Immediately afterwards, she used the Force to grab the A350 blaster rifle out of the hands of one of the scout guards and threw it at the scout guard firing their rifle behind her, knocking the guard out. The guard she had grabbed the blaster from then raised his hands in surrender and escaped from Tano. Dodging the strike of a heavy weapon, she then sliced a sentry guard in half, slicing the gong in half in the process.\n\nAs Elsbeth's forces took formation outside of the city's main building, Tano emerged from around one of the city's huts and began to slowly walk towards Elsbeth's army. Slowing to a halt, she tossed the shoulder plate of Djarin's armor for Elsbeth and her army to see, claiming that Djarin had failed to kill her and once again asked for Elsbeth to give her what she sought. Instead, Elsbeth ordered her guards to attack Tano, forcing her to leap up to the roof of one of the huts and block the oncoming blaster bolts with her lightsabers. Being forced to retreat, Tano leapt behind the huts and out of sight of Elsbeth's army.\n\nLeaping down behind two guards, Tano quickly used her lightsabers to eliminate them before disappearing once more. Emerging behind another two scout guards, Tano slowly revealed her lightsabers and dispatched the guards. Appearing upon a rooftop and igniting her lightsabers, she jumped down to face Elsbeth's hired gunfighter. Quickly disarming Lang, Tano stood triumphant for a moment, but was soon forced to divert her attention away when Elsbeth's two HK-87 assassin droids revealed themselves from opposite corners. Reacting quickly, Tano rushed up to one and slashing them in half before retreating and disappearing around another corner.\n\nStanding atop one of the walls outside of the main building, Tano witnessed a faceoff between Djarin, who had snuck into the city during the chaos, and Lang before jumping down to face Elsbeth within her garden. Signaling a fight was about to take place, Tano and Elsbeth both took off their robes and readied their weapons, standing only a few meters away from one another. Using a spear made of pure beskar, Elsbeth lunged at Tano who quickly blocked her spear with one of her lightsabers before blocking a second strike with the same blade. Having not moved any closer to one another, Tano and Elsbeth began to pace perpendicular to one another, looking for an opening in each other's defenses. With Elsbeth lunging at her, Tano blocked another one of Elsbeth's strikes, now with both lightsabers as the two exchanged several more blows as the fight intensified. Starting to go on the offensive, Tano executed several strikes against Elsbeth's beskar spear before having to dodge two of Elsbeth's oncoming strikes. Switching positions, Tano went back on the offensive as Elsbeth blocked a strike from both of her lightsabers and entering into a saber lock that resulted in Elsbeth being pushed back by Tano's brute strength.\n\nWith Elsbeth having launched a strike at her throat, Tano was forced to dodge as Elsbeth quickly began aiming for her legs causing Tano to slowly walk backwards, blocking each one of her strikes before Elsbeth swept for her legs, forcing Tano to perform a front flip. Going back on the offensive, Elsbeth and Tano entered into a brief saber lock before Tano executed a strike at Elsbeth, leading her to duck below Tano's oncoming strike. Staggered for a brief moment, Elsbeth managed to knock one of Tano's blades out of her hand and into a small body of water nearby. Now armed with only her shoto lightsaber, Tano slowly backed up before putting her single remaining blade into a reverse grip and attempted to regain her breath as she slowly pushed Elsbeth back. As Tano launched several heavy strikes, Elsbeth continued to parry them before unsuccessfully attempting to sweep Tano's leg, giving Tano the upper hand and allowing her to grab Elsbeth's weapon with her free hand and throw it to the ground. Putting her saber up to Elsbeth's throat, Tano asked her one last time where her master, Grand Admiral Thrawn, was located.\n\nBy the next day, Djarin and Tano, spear in hand, walked outside of the city's gates as the citizens of Calodan celebrated their liberation from Elsbeth's rule. Presenting the spear to Djarin, Tano stated that she believed Elsbeth's spear had been payment for Tano's defeat. However, Djarin refused the offer, citing how he hadn't completed the task, which Tano affirmed, but stated that she believed a Mandalorian should possess the spear. As Djarin took the weapon, Tano asked where Grogu was, to which Djarin revealed that he was on the ship and that he would retrieve the infant. As Djarin walked away, Tano gave a troubled look before she was joined by Governor Wing who she gesturing to head back into the city along with her as a gesture of friendship. The two then proudly walked back inside the city's walls.\n\nLater, Tano was present outside Djarin's gunship, the Razor Crest as Djarin was exiting with Grogu in hand to give to her to train. As he stepped outside, Tano stated that Grogu now saw Djarin as his father and once again stated that she could not train the youngling. Djarin was shocked by this, stating that he had held up his end of their bargain as Tano walked closer to him and took hold of Grogu's left hand. As she reached the two, Tano directed Djarin to the planet Tython where she recommended that he place Grogu on the seeing stone at the top of a mountain containing the ruins of an ancient temple with a strong connection to the Force. Djarin then questioned what he was supposed to do from there, to which Tano answered that Grogu would then be able to choose his own path and that if Grogu used the Force to reach out, a Jedi might be able to sense it and come to the planet searching for Grogu. However, she also stated that there were few remaining Jedi, which could possibly present a problem for the two. Djarin then thanked Tano and she wished for the Force to be with the two before smiling and bowing her head for Grogu, watching as the pair left in their gunship. With this, Tano began walking back towards Calodan, smiling.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Escapades at Saleucami[]\n\nBefore Rex departed with a 501st squad comprising troopers Jesse, Kix, and Hardcase, Kenobi instructed him to send back word before engaging Grievous if they happened to encounter the elusive general. While leading his men through the lush wetlands aboard BARC speeders, Rex became the target of a two-member droid commando sniper team. One of the droids fired at him with a sniper rifle, knocking him off his speeder with a shot through the chest. Rendered unconscious, Rex could only lie sprawled where he had fallen as his speeder crashed into some nearby brush. While Kix, the squad's medic, circled around to protect Rex, Jesse and Hardcase eliminated the droid commandos with rapid blasterfire. Lifting off Rex's helmet, Kix did a cursory examination but needed to remove his armor to discern the full extent of his wounds. Realizing that they were on farmland, Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix decided to head for the grounds' homestead to find a safe place to tend to their fallen captain. After assembling a makeshift litter for Rex and affixing it to his own BARC speeder, Jesse led the team to the homestead with Rex in tow. They received permission from the Twi'lek farmer Suu to use an eopie barn for Rex.\n\nJesse, Hardcase, and Kix carried the still-unconscious Rex onto a bench, removing his armor and the top half of his black body glove so that Kix could properly tend to him. Rex finally regained consciousness after Kix had dressed his chest wound with a pair of bacta patches, waking up to discover from Hardcase that had the potshot been two inches to the left, it would have passed straight through his heart and caused instantaneous death. He also found that he was unable to move his left arm due to nerve damage. Pulling himself up into a sitting position, Rex told Kix to patch him up so that they could continue the search for Grievous. However, Kix told him that his wound would take time and rest to heal, countermanding his orders with his authority as the team's medic. Rex's argument with Kix was cut short when Suu arrived at the barn with some food for the clones. Her daughter, Shaeeah, entered the room chasing a ball and, upon catching sight of Rex, blurted out that he resembled her own father, a comment that intrigued him and his comrades. Despite Suu's demonstration of kindness, Rex sensed that something was bothering her, though he could not fathom what it was. While Suu conferred with Jesse and gave him the plate of food, Kix dressed Rex in an arm sling to help avert his temporary paralysis. Hardcase retrieved one of the captain's DC-17 blaster pistols from the pile of his armor on the ground, placing it next to him on the bench for easy accessibility.\n\nAfter Suu had left with Shaeeah, Rex\u2014recognizing that he needed to rest if he wanted his injuries to heal\u2014reluctantly ordered his men to continue searching for Grievous without him. He entrusted command of the squad to Jesse, who departed the farm with Kix and Hardcase, leaving Rex behind. As night fell, Rex fell asleep on his bench, but a nosy eopie interrupted his slumber, sniffing him and licking his face. He forced the animal away, sighing before returning to sleep. He was later awoken a second time by the furtive sounds of an approaching figure\u2014the farmer, Suu's husband. Rex's eyes snapped open, but he decided to feign continued slumber while slowly reaching for his blaster pistol. Once the farmer was close enough, Rex struck out at his assailant with his blaster, but the farmer disarmed him with a staff. The unarmed Rex looked up at his host and was shocked to find himself staring at his own face\u2014the farmer was also a clone trooper. Recognizing this as the cause of Suu's earlier unsettledness, Rex demanded to know the trooper's number and rank, but the clone instead introduced himself as Cut Lawquane, a simple farmer. Realizing that Lawquane was a deserter, Rex called him out on his sworn oath to the Republic, but Lawquane replied that his duty was to his family, not to killing as a soldier. Their heated argument was interrupted when Suu brought her and Lawquane's children, Shaeeah and Jek, to welcome their adoptive father home.",

        "content": "# Rex - Escapades at Saleucami[]\n\nAs the war entered its second year, the Jedi Order learned that General Grievous had captured Jedi Master Eeth Koth. Skywalker, Kenobi, and Master Adi Gallia mounted a rescue mission to save Koth from Grievous's clutches and also capture the cunning Separatist general. Rex and a squad of troopers accompanied Skywalker and Gallia aboard an Eta-class shuttle, which joined the rest of the assembled Republic fleet in orbit of Coruscant in preparation for the assault. From his Arquitens-class light cruiser, Kenobi contacted Rex, Skywalker, and Gallia aboard their shuttle and conveyed the plan: Kenobi himself would head to the Saleucami system with the Republic fleet, distract Grievous's forces there, and transmit the coordinates of Grievous's command ship, which the Jedi presumed was where Grievous was holding Koth captive. Skywalker's shuttle would then be able to jump into the system undetected, infiltrate the command ship, and rescue Koth. While Kenobi and the Republic fleet departed for Saleucami, Rex and the others waited above Coruscant for Kenobi's transmission. Once Kenobi and Cody had transmitted the exact coordinates of Grievous's Recusant-class light destroyer, Skywalker took their shuttle to join the battle over Saleucami.\n\nWith Kenobi, Yularen, the Resolute, and the rest of the Republic fleet keeping the Confederate armada occupied, Skywalker's shuttle emerged from hyperspace and sped unopposed through the ongoing battle, quickly rotating upside down to dock to Grievous's destroyer. After securing the shuttle, Skywalker cut a hole in one of the command ship's hatches with his lightsaber and boarded the destroyer with Rex, Gallia, and their men. On Skywalker's orders, Rex and his men assumed guard positions around the hatch, as it was their only escape off the ship. While Skywalker and Gallia rescued Koth from captivity on the bridge, Grievous broke off from his ongoing duel with Kenobi aboard the Republic light cruiser and headed back to his own ship. Gallia subsequently went to prevent Grievous from escaping while Skywalker brought the weakened Koth back to the escape hatch, where Rex and the clones helped him into the shuttle before boarding themselves. As Skywalker released the shuttle from the destroyer, he and his comrades were contacted by Kenobi, who had pursued Grievous back to his command ship with Gallia, Cody, and several other clones; Kenobi requested transport off the ship before they became trapped there, as Grievous was abandoning ship. Skywalker complied and took the shuttle to the destroyer's main hangar, where they retrieved Kenobi, Gallia, Cody, and another trooper before the destroyer was damaged by debris from the naval engagement.\n\nAlthough Rex and his comrades had saved Koth, they had not succeeded with their secondary objective of capturing Grievous. Nonetheless, the cyborg general's attempted escape was foiled when his C-9979 troopship was hit by debris and forced to crash-land on Saleucami. Kenobi resolved to head to the surface with Rex and Cody to apprehend Grievous while Skywalker and Yularen continued the space battle. After Skywalker brought the shuttle to one of the Republic cruisers, Rex helped Koth onto the flight deck and then passed him on to Gallia and a 2-1B medical droid, who escorted him to a medical frigate. Rex and a contingent from the 501st Legion then joined Kenobi and Cody on an Acclamator-class assault ship for the voyage to Saleucami's surface. Once the transport had landed and unloaded its personnel and mat\u00e9riel, Kenobi briefed Rex on their plan: Instead of scattering their men to locate all of the enemy troopship's escape pods, they would investigate the crash site for leads about the escape pods' drop zones. Rex traveled on a BARC speeder as Kenobi deployed their biker scouts and AT-TE walkers in search of the downed troopship. Upon arrival at the crash site, Rex and 501st trooper Jesse found that the troop compartments were damaged and relayed their findings to Kenobi and Cody. Kenobi decided to send teams to search for the escape pods, with Rex leading a patrol of Saleucami's wetlands.",

        "content": "# Rex - Escapades at Saleucami[]\n\nRex fell through the floor and landed beside Lawquane, losing his grip on his blaster in the process. One of the droid commandos seized Rex by the throat in a choke hold, but Lawquane grabbed the fallen blaster and shot the droid's head cleanly off. With that, the last of the droids was destroyed, ensuring the safety of Suu and the children. The next morning, Rex prepared to rendezvous with Kenobi's assault force, recovering his armor and borrowing one of Lawquane's eopies, onto which he loaded his other gear. When Suu asked if he was going to turn in Lawquane for his desertion from the Grand Army, he stated that doing so was his duty but that in his condition, he might not \"remember\" his meeting with them. His discretion earned him a relieved thanks from Suu, who was grateful that she would not be separated from her husband. Rex soon received a comlink contact from Kenobi, whose assault the previous night had failed to detain Grievous yet again. Kenobi was glad to hear that Rex was on the mend, informing him that their battle group was waiting for him before they left Saleucami. Although Lawquane offered Rex a place at his home, Rex politely refused, not intending to impose on the farmer's family, and stated that his own family was elsewhere. With that, he bade goodbye to the Lawquanes and set off to rejoin Kenobi, leaving with a broader view of a soldier's loyalties.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Dealing with Morgan Elsbeth\n\nBy 9 ABY, by which point she had not seen Wren in years, Tano began hearing whispers surrounding the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn as heir to the Empire. Concerned about the idea, Tano began searching for Thrawn and followed a lead to the forested planet Corvus, looking for information on the location of the Grand Admiral. In order to obtain this information, Tano ventured to the city of Calodan, which was ruled by Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth, a servant and former apprentice of Thrawn, and her army. Bo-Katan Kryze knew of her journey to Corvus and directed the Mandalorian Din Djarin to her location in order for him to complete his quest to bring an infant of the same species as Yoda to the Jedi.\n\nWhile making her way to Calodan, Tano met great resistance and was attacked by a legion of Elsbeth's scout guards. Tano managed to overpower them and force them to retreat. As they retreated, Tano used her white lightsabers to cut down one of the guards as they retreated further towards the city gates of Calodan. Turning off her lightsabers and using the fog-filled forest to her advantage, Tano hid behind a tree and used the Force to distract the guards before reigniting her lightsabers and cutting through another one of them by slashing through a tree. In retaliation, the guards once again began firing at her with their A350 blaster rifles, leading Tano to use the Force to throw a piece of the tree she had just cut down at one of the guards, before turning off her lightsabers again, disappearing into the mist. Tano briefly emerged and cut down another guard using her lightsabers before disappearing once more as guards continued to shoot at her.\n\nSneaking behind of the guards, she cut them in half, leaving one guard remaining. As the last remaining guard attempted to retreat back to the city, Tano emerged from the mist and blocked the final guards' blaster bolts before cutting the guard down. As Tano returned to the mist, Elsbeth, from atop a sentry point on the walls surrounding Calodan, requested that Tano show herself, to which Tano obliged, lightsabers once again ignited. Elsbeth announced that she had been expecting Tano, to which she replied that she must then know what she was after. Elsbeth declared that she will learn nothing from her, but Tano bluntly stated that she will not give Elsbeth that choice.\n\nCalling up one of her HK-87 assassin droids, Elsbeth presented one of the town's inhabitants, now Elsbeth's captive, and asked how many lives Tano was willing to sacrifice to gain the information she sought. Elsbeth went on to note that the lives of the city's inhabitants meant little to her and that the people in the city would suffer because of Tano's interference. However, Tano declared that the people were already suffering under Elsbeth's rule and that Elsbeth should surrender if she did not want to face the consequences of her crimes. Raising one of her lightsabers, Tano announced that she would give Elsbeth one day to make her decision as Elsbeth disdainfully smirked at her. Extinguishing her lightsabers, Tano retreated back into the mist and away from Elsbeth.\n\nBy daybreak, Tano had retreated deep into the forest. Eventually, Tano discovered the Mandalorian Din Djarin who had been searching across the landscape for her. Seeing him as a threat, Tano lunged at him using her lightsabers; however, Djarin heard her and managed to block her lightsabers using his wrist gauntlets. As she continued to strike, Djarin managed to block each of her slashes by continuing to use his wrist gauntlets before using his flamethrower to stagger her and his whipcord launcher to immobilize her. Seeing a branch above her, Tano leapt over it, freeing her and, as the whipcord was still attached to Djarin's wrist gauntlet, dragging Djarin up with her before the whipcord snapped. Now free, Tano reignited her sabers, prepared to continue the fight before Djarin called out her name and declared that Bo-Katan had sent him, requesting to speak with the former Jedi. Noticing Djarin's foundling, a youngling of the same species as Yoda, sitting atop a rock, Tano moved out of her fighting stance and noted to Djarin that she hoped they would be talking about him.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Twilight of the apprentice\n\nTano asked Maul what \"game he was playing,\" to which he responded, \"the end game.\" Maul then said that the four had little time, as Vader himself was probably on his way to Malachor. The group slowly made their way to the top of the temple, but on their way, they met the Inquisitors again. Maul told Bridger to run to the top of the temple with the Sith holocron, while Maul stayed back to help Tano and Jarrus against the Inquisitors. Maul killed two of them with ease, while Jarrus indirectly finished off the last one. Not soon after, Maul revealed his true intentions to Tano and Jarrus, then lashed out at Jarrus, slashing him in the eyes and blinding him, but before Maul could deliver the killing blow, Tano intervened. The two fought briefly, but Tano realized time was running short and left Maul with Jarrus, who managed to throw Maul off the temple.\n\nTano made her way to the top of the temple where she found Darth Vader about to execute Bridger. She drew the Sith Lord's attention away from Bridger by addressing him. Vader told Tano that she would be spared if she gave him the location of any remaining Jedi. However, Tano told him that the Jedi had all been killed by Vader and his Inquisitors. Clearly disbelieving, Vader obliquely threatened to torture any such information out of Bridger if Tano would not cooperate. Tano replied in disgust that, though she had begun to suspect who Vader was behind his mask, his cruelty now led her to believe that he could not possibly be her former master. Vader stated flatly that Anakin Skywalker was weak and that he destroyed him. Angered, Tano snarled that she would avenge Skywalker's death. While Vader reminded her that revenge was not the Jedi way, Tano retorted that she was not a Jedi and attacked him.\n\nAfter several minutes of intense swordplay, Vader blasted Tano off of a ledge with the Force, and went to claim the temple's Sith holocron from Ezra. Tano, however, managed to survive her fall and rushed to re-engage Vader. She managed to catch up to him at the summit of the temple as he used the Force to pull Bridger, Jarrus, and the holocron to himself. Tano then leaped into action, ambushing Vader and managing to cut a furrow into his mask above his right eye.\n\nAs Jarrus and Bridger escaped, Tano heard Vader call out to her. However, because of the damage that had been done to his mask, his voice was no longer that of Vader, but a combination of Vader's mechanical baritone and Skywalker's unfiltered voice. She turned around to face him, and saw through the gash in his mask the charred face of her former master, confirming beyond any doubt that Vader and Skywalker were one and the same. As Vader regained his feet, Ahsoka called him \"Anakin\" and said she would not leave him as she had years ago. Vader paused for a moment upon hearing this, but then coldly responded that she would die and reactivated his weapon. The two engaged in combat once again and the temple locked down with a burst of energy, allowing Bridger and Jarrus to escape.\n\nTano was thus lost to the shadow and rubble of the crumbling Sith temple. Following the mission, Bridger blamed himself for the disaster, believing that Tano had been killed by Vader. Jarrus however, reassured him that the mission's outcome had not been his fault.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Dealing with Morgan Elsbeth\n\nBy nightfall, she and the youngling were telepathically communicating through the Force under the light of a lantern and a moon above. Standing up, Tano picked up the youngling, who, as she had discovered through their telepathic communication, was named Grogu and raised in the Jedi Temple. Tano brought Grogu and the lantern closer to Djarin and sat down next to the youngling. Djarin asked if Grogu was speaking to her and if she understood him. To this, Tano answered that she and Grogu could feel each other's thoughts. Djarin was shocked at learning Grogu's name for the first time and questioned the name upon hearing it. Tano reaffirmed that his name was Grogu and explained to Djarin that Grogu had been raised in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and that he had been trained by many masters over his many years. However, she went on to explain that he had been hidden away by someone at the temple at the end of the Clone Wars when the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire, but, after that, his memory became clouded and he did not remember much of the years following. Continuing on, Tano explained that Grogu had felt lost and alone after the Jedi Order's collapse.\n\nMoving on from Grogu's origins, Tano explained that she had known another member of his species, Jedi Grand Master Yoda, and noted how wise he had been. Tano asked Djarin if Grogu could still wield the Force as he had done at the Jedi Temple, to which Djarin questioned if she was referring to his powers. Tano explained that the Force is what gives Grogu his powers and that the Force was an energy field created by all living things. With this, she explained that one would need to have a great deal of discipline and training in the Force such powers. Now knowing this, Djarin brought up the supposedly unexplainable things Grogu had done prior and how he had been tasked to bring Grogu to a Jedi. However, to this, Tano simply explained that the Jedi Order had fallen long ago, to which Djarin noted that even though the Empire was gone, it still hunted Grogu and that he would need her help if he was to evade them longer. With that, Tano recommended that they let Grogu sleep and that she would test his abilities in the morning.\n\nAt daybreak, Tano, Djarin, and Grogu ventured to a clearing and, when they arrived, Tano walked up to Grogu and playfully stated that they would find out what knowledge Grogu possessed. With that, Tano motioned Djarin to place Grogu down on one of the rocks, which he complied with. Grabbing a small stone, Tano used the Force to slowly levitate the stone into Grogu's hands and explained that she wished for him to return the stone to her outstretched hand. Before giving him a chance to do anything, Djarin interjected and attempted to inform Tano that Grogu didn't understand, but Tano rejected his inquiry, simply stating that Grogu could understand what she was asking of him.\n\nArm still outstretched, she told Grogu that it was ok and once again requested the stone from Grogu. However, instead of returning the stone to her using the Force, Grogu simply dropped it, leading her to lower her arm in disappointment and walk towards him. Grabbing one of his small hands, Tano used the Force to feel his emotions and calmly announced that she felt great fear in Grogu and, as she stood up and walked back to her original position, she explained to Djarin that Grogu had hidden his abilities over the years in order to conceal himself.\n\nTano then announced that she wished to try something else and asked Djarin to come over to her. Djarin misunderstood and signaled for Grogu to go to Tano instead and when he didn't move, he exclaimed that Grogu was stubborn. However, Tano quickly stopped him and informed him that she was not the one who would be performing the test but Djarin himself, explaining that she wanted to see if he would listen to him. This prompted Djarin to begin complaining about how, if Grogu would listen to him, it would be one of the first times, to which Tano jokingly told Djarin that she liked firsts, whether they be good or bad because of how memorable they were. Handing the stone to Djarin, Tano instructed him to hold the stone in the palm of his hand and to request for Grogu to lift the stone using the Force.",

        "content": "# Rex - Mission to Taloraan[]\n\nDuring an assault on Separatist-loyal Trade Federation forces over the Bothan colony world of Kothlis, Rex served as the gunner of Tano's BTL-B Y-wing starfighter. Each in their own starfighter, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi led the Republic's attack on the Vulture droids deployed from a Federation Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship. Upon reaching the battleship, Tano released a volley of proton torpedoes at the vessel; Rex regarded the ship's subsequent destruction as a beautiful sight. The Separatist Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers were forced to flee, securing the Republic's victory over Kothlis. Shortly thereafter, Rex accompanied Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi to the planet Taloraan, where the Jedi were to undertake negotiations for Tibanna gas with the Denfrandi tribe, the dominant clan on the world. En route to Taloraan aboard the Resolute, Rex conferred with Tano on the prospect of the diplomacy that she would be engaging in over the next few days. Whereas Tano found diplomatic negotiations boring, Rex respected them as a different method of fighting, one for which he was not trained. While the three Jedi left for the capital, Taloraan City, in a Nu-class shuttle, Rex remained aboard the Resolute with Wullf Yularen to regularly check in with the Jedi.\n\nTo contact the Jedi, the Resolute had to routinely leave orbit for a closer signal range. Unbeknownst to the Republic, Denfrandi Magister Orlin Denache had secretly forged an alliance with the Confederacy and was housing battle droids on Taloraan. During one of the Resolute's regular trips into comm range, the Jedi\u2014who had discovered the Separatist presence in Taloraan City\u2014warned Yularen that the Resolute was heading into a trap: A Confederate Munificent-class frigate commanded by Captain Canteval was preparing to attack the cruiser. Yularen had his bridge crew raise the Resolute's shields just in time to deflect fire from the enemy frigate. While the Resolute battled Canteval's battlecruiser, Yularen sent Rex and a clone trooper detachment to rescue the Jedi, whose shuttle had been destroyed. After landing with several LAAT/i gunships at a platform in Taloraan City, Rex and his men fell under fire from the Separatist-allied Denfrandi, who had taken up positions behind some cargo boxes. The brief firefight ceased when Denache's emissary, Sech Govlinder, galvanized the rest of the Denfrandi into taking up arms and defeating the Separatists. The Jedi established an accord to abate hostilities between the Denfrandi and their rival tribe, the Wind Raiders, thanks to Tano's personal involvement in the matter. When Rex asked Tano if she had changed her mind about her disregard for diplomacy, she replied that she had indeed due to her firsthand experience in the field.\n\n",

Before leaving Atollon, Bridger told Tano about his predicament with the krykna and she explained that the Force became more mysterious as one learned more about it. Bridger then followed Tano back to the camp where they prepared to take off to Malachor.\n\nOn their way to Malachor, Rex contacted Tano and offered to join the crew on their mission to Malachor, as he would be there in just two rotations, but Tano declined his offer. After her talk with Rex, Tano moved to the cockpit of the Phantom. When Bridger asked Jarrus why Rex was so worried, Jarrus explained that before the Jedi Purge, the Jedi were told to never travel to Malachor because of old legends about the planet. Tano remarked that legends always held a bit of truth, after which Bridger wondered why Master Yoda would send the three to Malachor.\n\nThe group eventually made it out of hyperspace and Tano explained that they were seeking knowledge that would help them defeat the Sith. Before they landed on the planet, Chopper picked up a ship on the planet, but couldn't recognize what type it was. Jarrus told him to trace it as someone was clearly after the same thing the three were after as well.\n\nOnce on the surface, they landed on a site with strange looking obelisks. As they moved closer to one of them, they noticed that it was covered in an ancient dialogue that Tano could partially translate.

As they were recovering, they noticed that the place had a hidden, underground Sith Temple, which might have been the reason Master Yoda had sent them there.\n\nOn closer inspection, they realized the place was a battlefield with some figures turned into stone. Bridger also found an old crossguard lightsaber. While discussing the events of the battle, they were attacked by the Eighth Brother who tossed explosives at them, breaking another layer of rock beneath them and causing Bridger to fall further down. Tano and Jarrus decided to pursue the Inquisitor, as Bridger tried to look for a way back up. In his search for a way up, Bridger met a seemingly old and frail man trapped just as he was himself.\n\nBack on the surface, Chopper had discovered the Inquisitor's TIE Advanced, while Tano and Jarrus pursued the Inquisitor. Jarrus had noticed that the Inquisitor was surprised to meet the Jedi here, which could mean that the Inquisitor was searching for something on Malachor, further backing up his theory that the Inquisitor was after something other than the Jedi. At the Inquisitor's TIE, Chopper managed to hijack the ship and use it against the Inquisitor, helping Tano and Jarrus capture him. The pair deduced that the Inquisitor was hunting someone, but not them. When Ahsoka interrogated the Inquisitor, he revealed that he was hunting \"a shadow.\"\n\nWhen Bridger and his companion, who had revealed himself to be named Maul, managed to claim a Sith holocron which they had located beneath the temple, the whole structure went into \"stand-by\" mode with lights activating around it. This distracted Tano and Jarrus, which allowed the Inquisitor to secretly call for backup. They made their way to the temple, where they encountered the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother. The two Inquisitors freed the Eighth Brother and a fight broke out between the Inquisitors and the two Jedi. Maul and Bridger soon found Tano and Jarrus, and Maul activated his double-bladed lightsaber, taking on the three Inquisitors single-handedly and forcing them to retreat.\n\nTano asked Maul what \"game he was playing,\" to which he responded, \"the end game.\" Maul then said that the four had little time, as Vader himself was probably on his way to Malachor. The group slowly made their way to the top of the temple, but on their way, they met the Inquisitors again. Maul told Bridger to run to the top of the temple with the Sith holocron, while Maul stayed back to help Tano and Jarrus against the Inquisitors. Maul killed two of them with ease, while Jarrus indirectly finished off the last one. Not soon after, Maul revealed his true intentions to Tano and Jarrus, then lashed out at Jarrus, slashing him in the eyes and blinding him, but before Maul could deliver the killing blow, Tano intervened. The two fought briefly, but Tano realized time was running short and left Maul with Jarrus, who managed to throw Maul off the temple.\n\nTano made her way to the top of the temple where she found Darth Vader about to execute Bridger. She drew the Sith Lord's attention away from Bridger by addressing him. Vader told Tano that she would be spared if she gave him the location of any remaining Jedi. However, Tano told him that the Jedi had all been killed by Vader and his Inquisitors. Clearly disbelieving, Vader obliquely threatened to torture any such information out of Bridger if Tano would not cooperate. Tano replied in disgust that, though she had begun to suspect who Vader was behind his mask, his cruelty now led her to believe that he could not possibly be her former master. Vader stated flatly that Anakin Skywalker was weak and that he destroyed him. Angered, Tano snarled that she would avenge Skywalker's death. While Vader reminded her that revenge was not the Jedi way, Tano retorted that she was not a Jedi and attacked him.\n\nAfter several minutes of intense swordplay, Vader blasted Tano off of a ledge with the Force, and went to claim the temple's Sith holocron from Ezra. Tano, however, managed to survive her fall and rushed to re-engage Vader. She managed to catch up to him at the summit of the temple as he used the Force to pull Bridger, Jarrus, and the holocron to himself. Tano then leaped into action, ambushing Vader and managing to cut a furrow into his mask above his right eye.\n\nAs Jarrus and Bridger escaped, Tano heard Vader call out to her. However, because of the damage that had been done to his mask, his voice was no longer that of Vader, but a combination of Vader's mechanical baritone and Skywalker's unfiltered voice. She turned around to face him, and saw through the gash in his mask the charred face of her former master, confirming beyond any doubt that Vader and Skywalker were one and the same. As Vader regained his feet, Ahsoka called him \"Anakin\" and said she would not leave him as she had years ago. Vader paused for a moment upon hearing this, but then coldly responded that she would die and reactivated his weapon. The two engaged in combat once again and the temple locked down with a burst of energy, allowing Bridger and Jarrus to escape.\n\nTano was thus lost to the shadow and rubble of the crumbling Sith temple. Following the mission, Bridger blamed himself for the disaster, believing that Tano had been killed by Vader. Jarrus however, reassured him that the mission's outcome had not been his fault.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Mandalorian affairs[]\n\nThe Mandalorian Death Watch, a terrorist splinter group allied with the Confederacy, later emerged in opposition to Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore and her dominant regime, the pacifistic New Mandalorians. With Kryze's life in danger, Rex was assigned with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody to escort Kryze to Coruscant, where she intended to reaffirm her people's position of neutrality before the Galactic Senate. Rex, Skywalker, Cody, and their clone squad met with Kenobi\u2014who had been conducting an investigation into false rumors that Kryze had joined the Confederacy\u2014at a spaceport in Mandalore's capital city, Sundari, where Kryze's starship, the Coronet, was preparing to depart. After checking in with Kenobi, Rex and his comrades joined Kryze and her entourage aboard the Coronet, which then left for Coruscant. En route to the Republic capital, Skywalker and Kenobi gathered their troops in the cargo hold for a briefing. The Jedi told the clones to stay vigilant for the Death Watch, which would stop at nothing to assassinate Kryze before she reached Coruscant. Rex and Cody sent their men to begin their rounds of the cargo bay, patrolling for any signs of danger, while Skywalker and Kenobi left to meet with Kryze.\n\nDuring their patrol, Rex and Cody bumped into R2-D2, who appeared to have been frightened by something. The two officers also found they were unable to make contact with two of their men, Mixer and Redeye. Rex contacted Kenobi, who sent Skywalker back to assist in investigating the disturbance. Bringing the rest of the squad with them, Rex and Cody followed Skywalker and R2-D2 with headlamps ablaze through the labyrinth of containers in search of Mixer and Redeye. Their focus shifted upon finding an open and overturned crate, with Skywalker ordering Rex, Cody, and their men to find the box's missing contents. The disappeared cargo manifested itself as a large assassin probe droid, which had killed Mixer and Redeye and now began to attack Skywalker. Rex and his comrades intercepted the droid during its fight with Skywalker, disabling it with blasterfire before it could crush their Jedi General with its large legs. However, a second assassin probe took advantage of their distraction to head for the turbolift shaft leading to the dining room, where Kenobi was guarding Kryze and her Senatorial colleagues. Rex and the others ran for the lift but were unable to prevent the assassin probe from climbing up to the dining room; Skywalker notified Kenobi of the impending danger via comlink.\n\nAs Skywalker speculated on the possibility that more assassin droids were aboard, the fallen assassin probe hatched an army of tiny but deadly probe killer droids. Rex, Cody, and their men opened fire on the probe killers and, despite some casualties, managed to repel the majority of the nuisances. Although Rex wondered aloud how the assassin probe had gotten aboard the Coronet, Skywalker instead focused on the more specific question of who had smuggled it aboard to assassinate Kryze. After finding the protocol droid in charge of the cargo manifest, Skywalker ascertained that someone had used a Senate stamp to approve the shipment of the crates containing the assassin droids. Acting on that lead, Kenobi launched into an interrogation of the four senators aboard the Coronet\u2014Onaconda Farr, Kin Robb, Orn Free Taa, and Tal Merrik\u2014to determine which one of them had smuggled the droids aboard, while Rex and his men joined Skywalker in scouring the cargo hold for the third and final assassin probe. While patrolling with Rex, Cody stopped to examine a trooper's abandoned helmet and became the victim of a probe killer that had been hiding inside it. Cody fell to the floor as he tried to fight off the probe killer, and when Rex tried to grab the droid off his comrade, two more of them jumped onto the captain. Both officers were saved by the timely arrival of Skywalker and R2-D2, who disabled the enemy droids with lightsaber and electric shocker, respectively.\n\nRex informed Skywalker that he still had not seen the remaining assassin probe, but a moment later, the droid jumped out from behind some nearby crates and bowled over the captain. With Rex taken by surprise, the assassin probe climbed on top of him and prepared to impale him with its front pincers. Recovering quickly, Rex grabbed the droid's legs and kicked his attacker off him before it could do any harm. He and Cody fired at the droid as it escaped up a wall, and though both of them landed hits, it was not until Skywalker threw his lightsaber at the droid and severed most of its legs that it toppled back to the floor. Running over, Rex slammed his foot down on the disabled probe and rained down blasterfire on its cranial unit, preventing it from releasing its probe killer spawn. A triad of Separatist Droch-class boarding ships\u2014called in by Tal Merrik, whom Kenobi had exposed as the Death Watch agent\u2014thereafter assaulted the Coronet, penetrating its hull to deploy a boarding party of super battle droids. Joining Skywalker in one of the hallways, Rex and Cody led their men in a firefight with the battle droids. Rex and the others were able to bring about the Separatists' defeat and left the hallway littered with droid parts.\n\nThe rest of the Coronet's journey went uninterrupted, with Rex and his comrades safely transporting Kryze and her entourage to Coruscant. After they docked at a landing pad, Rex, Cody, and their men disembarked with Skywalker and Kenobi, their escort duty ending as a success.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Escapades at Saleucami[]\n\nAfter greeting his children, Lawquane invited Rex to dinner with his family, which he accepted when Shaeeah and Jek begged him to come. Putting the top half of his body glove back on, Rex joined the Lawquanes at their home, with him and Lawquane debating their distinct ideologies over a meal of roast nuna. Though Lawquane argued that the clones deserved more individuality, Rex countered that he was making an individual and deliberate choice to serve the Republic. Despite disagreeing, Lawquane respected his opinion, believing that everyone had a right to his or her own beliefs. After dinner, Rex and Lawquane continued their discussion of principles over a game of dejarik holochess. Following Rex's inquiries into the cause of his desertion from the Republic Military, Lawquane recounted his service in an engagement shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis. A devastating ambush by enemy battle droids had caused him to flee the carnage-laden battlefield, and he had subsequently begun to question his apparent expendability in the war. The wayward deserter eventually found his way to Saleucami and married Suu.\n\nA survivor of Geonosis himself, Rex sympathized with Lawquane and stated that he, too, had lost many brothers\u2014whom he had come to regard as his family and home\u2014during the course of his military career. They began to reach common ground, with Rex in particular gaining a newfound respect for the man he had at first labeled a disloyal deserter. In the meantime, Shaeeah and Jek received permission from Lawquane to play outside, prompting Rex to express his admiration of the children to their father. In response, Lawquane, perceiving that Rex believed he was a coward, voiced his determination to keep his children safe until his dying breath. Rex, Lawquane, and Suu jumped to their feet when Jek and Shaeeah returned to the homestead in screams. Learning from Shaeeah that \"monsters\" were following them, Lawquane grabbed a pair of electrobinoculars to discern what she meant. Training his binoculars through the dark fields, he spotted some twenty droid commandos, which had been deployed from a crashed Separatist escape pod that Shaeeah and Jek had happened upon. With the droid commandos beginning to surround the homestead, Lawquane prepared for a confrontation with the droids, locking the front door and sending Suu to take refuge upstairs with Jek and Shaeeah.\n\nWhen Rex inquired after Lawquane's weapon supply, Lawquane headed over to a closet and pulled out a blaster pistol for the captain, taking a rifle and carbine for himself. Rex volunteered a plan to catch the droids in a crossfire, but Lawquane cited the captain's injuries as a weakness and refused. Though taken aback by Lawquane's assertion, Rex grasped his meaning when the farmer clarified it for him: He was asking Rex to serve as a last line of defense for his family while he himself took point against the droids. Assuring Lawquane that he would take care of them, Rex went to join Suu, Shaeeah, and Jek in the bedroom on the second floor. Presently, the droids launched their attack on the homestead. Although Lawquane eliminated a number of them, several made it past him, and he warned Rex about the approaching droids. While Suu hid with Jek and Shaeeah by the bunk beds, Rex took up position, waiting at the end of the hallway leading to the stairwell doorway. Once the droid commandos had entered the hallway, Rex forsook his hiding spot and opened fire on them, gunning down a pair of the enemy units. While exchanging blasterfire with another of the droids, he managed to hit the droid in the head but not before it released a barrage of fire at the platform he was crouching on.",

        "content": "# Rex - Escapades at Saleucami[]\n\nAs the war entered its second year, the Jedi Order learned that General Grievous had captured Jedi Master Eeth Koth. Skywalker, Kenobi, and Master Adi Gallia mounted a rescue mission to save Koth from Grievous's clutches and also capture the cunning Separatist general. Rex and a squad of troopers accompanied Skywalker and Gallia aboard an Eta-class shuttle, which joined the rest of the assembled Republic fleet in orbit of Coruscant in preparation for the assault. From his Arquitens-class light cruiser, Kenobi contacted Rex, Skywalker, and Gallia aboard their shuttle and conveyed the plan: Kenobi himself would head to the Saleucami system with the Republic fleet, distract Grievous's forces there, and transmit the coordinates of Grievous's command ship, which the Jedi presumed was where Grievous was holding Koth captive. Skywalker's shuttle would then be able to jump into the system undetected, infiltrate the command ship, and rescue Koth. While Kenobi and the Republic fleet departed for Saleucami, Rex and the others waited above Coruscant for Kenobi's transmission. Once Kenobi and Cody had transmitted the exact coordinates of Grievous's Recusant-class light destroyer, Skywalker took their shuttle to join the battle over Saleucami.\n\nWith Kenobi, Yularen, the Resolute, and the rest of the Republic fleet keeping the Confederate armada occupied, Skywalker's shuttle emerged from hyperspace and sped unopposed through the ongoing battle, quickly rotating upside down to dock to Grievous's destroyer. After securing the shuttle, Skywalker cut a hole in one of the command ship's hatches with his lightsaber and boarded the destroyer with Rex, Gallia, and their men. On Skywalker's orders, Rex and his men assumed guard positions around the hatch, as it was their only escape off the ship. While Skywalker and Gallia rescued Koth from captivity on the bridge, Grievous broke off from his ongoing duel with Kenobi aboard the Republic light cruiser and headed back to his own ship. Gallia subsequently went to prevent Grievous from escaping while Skywalker brought the weakened Koth back to the escape hatch, where Rex and the clones helped him into the shuttle before boarding themselves. As Skywalker released the shuttle from the destroyer, he and his comrades were contacted by Kenobi, who had pursued Grievous back to his command ship with Gallia, Cody, and several other clones; Kenobi requested transport off the ship before they became trapped there, as Grievous was abandoning ship. Skywalker complied and took the shuttle to the destroyer's main hangar, where they retrieved Kenobi, Gallia, Cody, and another trooper before the destroyer was damaged by debris from the naval engagement.\n\nAlthough Rex and his comrades had saved Koth, they had not succeeded with their secondary objective of capturing Grievous. Nonetheless, the cyborg general's attempted escape was foiled when his C-9979 troopship was hit by debris and forced to crash-land on Saleucami. Kenobi resolved to head to the surface with Rex and Cody to apprehend Grievous while Skywalker and Yularen continued the space battle. After Skywalker brought the shuttle to one of the Republic cruisers, Rex helped Koth onto the flight deck and then passed him on to Gallia and a 2-1B medical droid, who escorted him to a medical frigate. Rex and a contingent from the 501st Legion then joined Kenobi and Cody on an Acclamator-class assault ship for the voyage to Saleucami's surface. Once the transport had landed and unloaded its personnel and mat\u00e9riel, Kenobi briefed Rex on their plan: Instead of scattering their men to locate all of the enemy troopship's escape pods, they would investigate the crash site for leads about the escape pods' drop zones. Rex traveled on a BARC speeder as Kenobi deployed their biker scouts and AT-TE walkers in search of the downed troopship. Upon arrival at the crash site, Rex and 501st trooper Jesse found that the troop compartments were damaged and relayed their findings to Kenobi and Cody. Kenobi decided to send teams to search for the escape pods, with Rex leading a patrol of Saleucami's wetlands.\n\nBefore Rex departed with a 501st squad comprising troopers Jesse, Kix, and Hardcase, Kenobi instructed him to send back word before engaging Grievous if they happened to encounter the elusive general. While leading his men through the lush wetlands aboard BARC speeders, Rex became the target of a two-member droid commando sniper team. One of the droids fired at him with a sniper rifle, knocking him off his speeder with a shot through the chest. Rendered unconscious, Rex could only lie sprawled where he had fallen as his speeder crashed into some nearby brush. While Kix, the squad's medic, circled around to protect Rex, Jesse and Hardcase eliminated the droid commandos with rapid blasterfire. Lifting off Rex's helmet, Kix did a cursory examination but needed to remove his armor to discern the full extent of his wounds. Realizing that they were on farmland, Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix decided to head for the grounds' homestead to find a safe place to tend to their fallen captain. After assembling a makeshift litter for Rex and affixing it to his own BARC speeder, Jesse led the team to the homestead with Rex in tow. They received permission from the Twi'lek farmer Suu to use an eopie barn for Rex.\n\nJesse, Hardcase, and Kix carried the still-unconscious Rex onto a bench, removing his armor and the top half of his black body glove so that Kix could properly tend to him. Rex finally regained consciousness after Kix had dressed his chest wound with a pair of bacta patches, waking up to discover from Hardcase that had the potshot been two inches to the left, it would have passed straight through his heart and caused instantaneous death. He also found that he was unable to move his left arm due to nerve damage. Pulling himself up into a sitting position, Rex told Kix to patch him up so that they could continue the search for Grievous. However, Kix told him that his wound would take time and rest to heal, countermanding his orders with his authority as the team's medic. Rex's argument with Kix was cut short when Suu arrived at the barn with some food for the clones. Her daughter, Shaeeah, entered the room chasing a ball and, upon catching sight of Rex, blurted out that he resembled her own father, a comment that intrigued him and his comrades. Despite Suu's demonstration of kindness, Rex sensed that something was bothering her, though he could not fathom what it was. While Suu conferred with Jesse and gave him the plate of food, Kix dressed Rex in an arm sling to help avert his temporary paralysis. Hardcase retrieved one of the captain's DC-17 blaster pistols from the pile of his armor on the ground, placing it next to him on the bench for easy accessibility.\n\nAfter Suu had left with Shaeeah, Rex\u2014recognizing that he needed to rest if he wanted his injuries to heal\u2014reluctantly ordered his men to continue searching for Grievous without him. He entrusted command of the squad to Jesse, who departed the farm with Kix and Hardcase, leaving Rex behind. As night fell, Rex fell asleep on his bench, but a nosy eopie interrupted his slumber, sniffing him and licking his face. He forced the animal away, sighing before returning to sleep. He was later awoken a second time by the furtive sounds of an approaching figure\u2014the farmer, Suu's husband. Rex's eyes snapped open, but he decided to feign continued slumber while slowly reaching for his blaster pistol. Once the farmer was close enough, Rex struck out at his assailant with his blaster, but the farmer disarmed him with a staff. The unarmed Rex looked up at his host and was shocked to find himself staring at his own face\u2014the farmer was also a clone trooper. Recognizing this as the cause of Suu's earlier unsettledness, Rex demanded to know the trooper's number and rank, but the clone instead introduced himself as Cut Lawquane, a simple farmer. Realizing that Lawquane was a deserter, Rex called him out on his sworn oath to the Republic, but Lawquane replied that his duty was to his family, not to killing as a soldier. Their heated argument was interrupted when Suu brought her and Lawquane's children, Shaeeah and Jek, to welcome their adoptive father home.\n\nAfter greeting his children, Lawquane invited Rex to dinner with his family, which he accepted when Shaeeah and Jek begged him to come. Putting the top half of his body glove back on, Rex joined the Lawquanes at their home, with him and Lawquane debating their distinct ideologies over a meal of roast nuna. Though Lawquane argued that the clones deserved more individuality, Rex countered that he was making an individual and deliberate choice to serve the Republic. Despite disagreeing, Lawquane respected his opinion, believing that everyone had a right to his or her own beliefs. After dinner, Rex and Lawquane continued their discussion of principles over a game of dejarik holochess. Following Rex's inquiries into the cause of his desertion from the Republic Military, Lawquane recounted his service in an engagement shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis. A devastating ambush by enemy battle droids had caused him to flee the carnage-laden battlefield, and he had subsequently begun to question his apparent expendability in the war. The wayward deserter eventually found his way to Saleucami and married Suu.\n\nA survivor of Geonosis himself, Rex sympathized with Lawquane and stated that he, too, had lost many brothers\u2014whom he had come to regard as his family and home\u2014during the course of his military career.

In response, Lawquane, perceiving that Rex believed he was a coward, voiced his determination to keep his children safe until his dying breath. Rex, Lawquane, and Suu jumped to their feet when Jek and Shaeeah returned to the homestead in screams. Learning from Shaeeah that \"monsters\" were following them, Lawquane grabbed a pair of electrobinoculars to discern what she meant.

Although Lawquane eliminated a number of them, several made it past him, and he warned Rex about the approaching droids. While Suu hid with Jek and Shaeeah by the bunk beds, Rex took up position, waiting at the end of the hallway leading to the stairwell doorway. Once the droid commandos had entered the hallway, Rex forsook his hiding spot and opened fire on them, gunning down a pair of the enemy units. While exchanging blasterfire with another of the droids, he managed to hit the droid in the head but not before it released a barrage of fire at the platform he was crouching on.\n\nRex fell through the floor and landed beside Lawquane, losing his grip on his blaster in the process. One of the droid commandos seized Rex by the throat in a choke hold, but Lawquane grabbed the fallen blaster and shot the droid's head cleanly off. With that, the last of the droids was destroyed, ensuring the safety of Suu and the children. The next morning, Rex prepared to rendezvous with Kenobi's assault force, recovering his armor and borrowing one of Lawquane's eopies, onto which he loaded his other gear. When Suu asked if he was going to turn in Lawquane for his desertion from the Grand Army, he stated that doing so was his duty but that in his condition, he might not \"remember\" his meeting with them. His discretion earned him a relieved thanks from Suu, who was grateful that she would not be separated from her husband. Rex soon received a comlink contact from Kenobi, whose assault the previous night had failed to detain Grievous yet again. Kenobi was glad to hear that Rex was on the mend, informing him that their battle group was waiting for him before they left Saleucami. Although Lawquane offered Rex a place at his home, Rex politely refused, not intending to impose on the farmer's family, and stated that his own family was elsewhere. With that, he bade goodbye to the Lawquanes and set off to rejoin Kenobi, leaving with a broader view of a soldier's loyalties.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Dealing with Morgan Elsbeth\n\nAs Tano walked past Djarin to witness the test, Tano whispered into his ear a request for him to use Grogu's name as opposed to referring to him as \"kid\" as he had done when first requesting for him to take the stone. Walking away and leaning on a large boulder, Tano watched as Djarin requested for Grogu to take the stone once more and him giving up moments later, once again claiming Grogu was stubborn. To this, Tano instructed Djarin to try to connect with Grogu prompting Djarin to pull out a small, silver ball used on one of the levers on his gunship, the Razor Crest, which Grogu had become quite fond of. Kneeling down, Djarin asked if Grogu wanted the ball and requested for him to take it. With little hesitation, Grogu used the Force to pull the ball to him.\n\nDjarin congratulated Grogu on this, and, while doing so, Tano noted the attachment Grogu had formed with him and that she could not train him. Djarin was shocked by this and asked why she could not, citing his abilities. To this, Tano explained that his attachment to Djarin made him vulnerable to the dark side. Djarin, however, did not understand and insisted that this was even more of a reason to train Grogu, but Tano once again refused, indirectly citing her former master, Anakin Skywalker, and how his emotions had gotten the best of him, turning him to the dark side. She once again refused to allow Grogu to go down that path and said that it would be better if they just let Grogu's abilities with the Force fade as he grew older. Hurrying, Tano informed Djarin that she had waited too long and that she had to return to Calodan and save its inhabitants.\n\nAs Tano walked away, Djarin noted how Elsbeth had sent Djarin to kill her and that he had not agreed to anything of what Tano had just told him. Attempting to strike a deal, Djarin told Tano that he would assist Tano in saving Calodan if she assisted him in training Grogu. Agreeing to this, Tano and Djarin set off on their journey back to Calodan.\n\nOn their way back to Calodan, Djarin noted the forces Elsbeth had under her control, including the HK-87 assassin droids, scout guards, and her hired gunfighter, Lang, and mentioned how he believed that her lightsabers would not be able to protect her from the amount of blaster bolts that would be shot at her. In response, Tano affirmed his remark and that he should also be wary of the magistrate herself. Upon Djarin's questioning of who Elsbeth, Tano revealed her name to Djarin and that her home had been ravaged during the Clone Wars with her people massacred. Continuing on, she further explained that this developed a great anger in her, which led to her helping construct warships for the Imperial Navy and ravage worlds herself. This led Djarin to note the burned forest that surrounded them. After quickly surveying the environment, Tano asked Djarin if he had seen any prisoners within the city's walls, leading him to note the three villagers that had been taken prisoner. Tano declared that they had to find a way to free them, to which Djarin noted that Elsbeth's army would never see the pairing of the two coming.\n\nAt late dusk, the two finally completed their journey. Running at the city's entrance, Tano used the Force to leap up to the sentry point at the city's gate, igniting one of her lightsabers and kicking one of the scout guards. Blocking the blaster bolts fired at her by another scout guard, Tano grabbed the guard and flung them against a support beam of a gong, the city's alarm system, before promptly blocking the blaster bolts of another scout guard. She then threw the body of the scout guard she had grabbed prior and tossing him into the wall opposite of where he had been prior. Immediately afterwards, she used the Force to grab the A350 blaster rifle out of the hands of one of the scout guards and threw it at the scout guard firing their rifle behind her, knocking the guard out. The guard she had grabbed the blaster from then raised his hands in surrender and escaped from Tano. Dodging the strike of a heavy weapon, she then sliced a sentry guard in half, slicing the gong in half in the process.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Twilight of the apprentice\n\nAfter the rebellion set up a new base on planet Atollon, Tano traveled there to meet with Jarrus and Bridger, to join them on their quest to Malachor. Before leaving Atollon, Bridger told Tano about his predicament with the krykna and she explained that the Force became more mysterious as one learned more about it. Bridger then followed Tano back to the camp where they prepared to take off to Malachor.\n\nOn their way to Malachor, Rex contacted Tano and offered to join the crew on their mission to Malachor, as he would be there in just two rotations, but Tano declined his offer. After her talk with Rex, Tano moved to the cockpit of the Phantom. When Bridger asked Jarrus why Rex was so worried, Jarrus explained that before the Jedi Purge, the Jedi were told to never travel to Malachor because of old legends about the planet. Tano remarked that legends always held a bit of truth, after which Bridger wondered why Master Yoda would send the three to Malachor.\n\nThe group eventually made it out of hyperspace and Tano explained that they were seeking knowledge that would help them defeat the Sith. Before they landed on the planet, Chopper picked up a ship on the planet, but couldn't recognize what type it was. Jarrus told him to trace it as someone was clearly after the same thing the three were after as well.\n\nOnce on the surface, they landed on a site with strange looking obelisks. As they moved closer to one of them, they noticed that it was covered in an ancient dialogue that Tano could partially translate. As Tano began reading the phrases out loud, Bridger became hypnotized by them and touched the pillar, causing the surface below them to collapse and the three to fall underground. As they were recovering, they noticed that the place had a hidden, underground Sith Temple, which might have been the reason Master Yoda had sent them there.\n\nOn closer inspection, they realized the place was a battlefield with some figures turned into stone. Bridger also found an old crossguard lightsaber. While discussing the events of the battle, they were attacked by the Eighth Brother who tossed explosives at them, breaking another layer of rock beneath them and causing Bridger to fall further down. Tano and Jarrus decided to pursue the Inquisitor, as Bridger tried to look for a way back up. In his search for a way up, Bridger met a seemingly old and frail man trapped just as he was himself.\n\nBack on the surface, Chopper had discovered the Inquisitor's TIE Advanced, while Tano and Jarrus pursued the Inquisitor. Jarrus had noticed that the Inquisitor was surprised to meet the Jedi here, which could mean that the Inquisitor was searching for something on Malachor, further backing up his theory that the Inquisitor was after something other than the Jedi. At the Inquisitor's TIE, Chopper managed to hijack the ship and use it against the Inquisitor, helping Tano and Jarrus capture him. The pair deduced that the Inquisitor was hunting someone, but not them. When Ahsoka interrogated the Inquisitor, he revealed that he was hunting \"a shadow.\"\n\nWhen Bridger and his companion, who had revealed himself to be named Maul, managed to claim a Sith holocron which they had located beneath the temple, the whole structure went into \"stand-by\" mode with lights activating around it. This distracted Tano and Jarrus, which allowed the Inquisitor to secretly call for backup. They made their way to the temple, where they encountered the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother. The two Inquisitors freed the Eighth Brother and a fight broke out between the Inquisitors and the two Jedi. Maul and Bridger soon found Tano and Jarrus, and Maul activated his double-bladed lightsaber, taking on the three Inquisitors single-handedly and forcing them to retreat.",

With Rex taken by surprise, the assassin probe climbed on top of him and prepared to impale him with its front pincers. Recovering quickly, Rex grabbed the droid's legs and kicked his attacker off him before it could do any harm. He and Cody fired at the droid as it escaped up a wall, and though both of them landed hits, it was not until Skywalker threw his lightsaber at the droid and severed most of its legs that it toppled back to the floor. Running over, Rex slammed his foot down on the disabled probe and rained down blasterfire on its cranial unit, preventing it from releasing its probe killer spawn. A triad of Separatist Droch-class boarding ships\u2014called in by Tal Merrik, whom Kenobi had exposed as the Death Watch agent\u2014thereafter assaulted the Coronet, penetrating its hull to deploy a boarding party of super battle droids. Joining Skywalker in one of the hallways, Rex and Cody led their men in a firefight with the battle droids. Rex and the others were able to bring about the Separatists' defeat and left the hallway littered with droid parts.\n\nThe rest of the Coronet's journey went uninterrupted, with Rex and his comrades safely transporting Kryze and her entourage to Coruscant.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The World Between Worlds\n\nUnbeknownst to Jarrus and Bridger, however, the duel between Tano and Vader had had a very different outcome from the one in which they believed. As the holocron chamber locked down, Vader re-engaged Tano and quickly overwhelmed her. As the two engaged in a final bladelock, Vader began to push through her guard, but became distracted by the enormous energy discharges emanating from the damaged holocron dock. This allowed Tano to push Vader back a step with the Force and disengage. She then plunged her lightsabers into the floor near her feet, destabilizing the floor beneath herself and Vader. Vader glanced down at the floor, but disregarded it and prepared to strike down his former apprentice. However, as Vader struck what would have been a killing blow, a portal suddenly appeared from behind Tano and a figure grabbed her by the shoulder, pulling her into a mysterious dimension. Vader's strike missed, and he fell through the collapsing floor into a pool of light.\n\nOnce Tano came to, she realized the one who pulled her into the portal was in fact Ezra Bridger, although two years older. Tano was confused about what was happening and she wondered where Jarrus was. Bridger explained what had happened and where the two were located. Bridger concluded that if he could save Tano, he could also save his master. Tano warned him that if he were to do so, Bridger and the others would die, but Bridger stubbornly raced away from her to seek out a portal that would allow him to save his master. Tano caught up to Bridger, who gazed into a portal to see his master's final moments. She told Ezra that he could not intervene because Jarrus' sacrifice saved their lives. A crestfallen Bridger told her that she didn't know what she was asking him to do, but Tano sadly said that she was asking him to let go of his master, just as she had let go of hers, after learning that Anakin Skywalker's destiny lay on a path separated from hers. Seeing the inevitable, Ezra allowed the fire caused by the fuel pods to consume Jarrus.\n\nAfter Bridger let go of his master, he and Tano decided to head out of the dimension. However, the portal about Jarrus turned out to be a trick by Darth Sidious, who attempted to manipulate Bridger into letting the Emperor travel into the world. Tano used the Force to block the Emperor's fiery energy, but as she struggled to maintain the barrier, Ezra helped her before the pair fled. When Ezra was snared by a tendril of energy, Tano used her lightsabers to free him. As they kept running, they were separated, but promised to meet each other once again in the future. As Bridger headed back to the portal from where he arrived, Tano made her way into another portal, which brought her back to Malachor, near the base of the Sith temple, accompanied by her convor friend Morai. She wished the Force to be with Ezra Bridger and headed down into a dark tunnel with Morai.\n\nUpon her entrance into the dark tunnel, Tano came across a flight of steps which took her deeper into the tunnel, eventually finding a stream and Morai waiting for her. She then entered the stream and followed Morai to another flight of steps that eventually led her to another portal into the World Between Worlds. With this, she stepped inside of it, returning to the mystical plane. Ahsoka Tano thus embarked on a spiritual journey that changed the course of her life. Morai, meanwhile, left the temple and was seen by Vader as he trekked across the surface of Malachor. Vader assumed Tano to have died. With her supposed death, the Great Jedi Purge came to an end.\n\n",

Before leaving to continue interrogating Poggle with the other Jedi, Skywalker privately told Rex to remain on the lookout for any contact from Tano, which he agreed to do. Rex soon contacted TB-73 himself, and Tano answered the transmission, expressing her relief to hear from him. Once Rex put Skywalker through, Tano reported that Geonosian brain worms had overrun her frigate. The worms, originating from Karina the Great's hive, were capable of mind control and had already infected most of TB-73's embarked troopers from Tango Company. After resolving to wheedle information on the worms from Poggle, Skywalker severed the connection and headed to the detention level. Skywalker soon rejoined Rex, Kenobi, Mundi, and Unduli on the bridge and reported Tano's predicament, continuing with the news that the worms were susceptible to cold temperatures. Since he had Force-choked the so-far-uncooperative Poggle to compel him to divulge the information, Skywalker evaded the other Jedi's inquiries as to how he had gleaned the information. He relayed the worms' weakness to Tano, who neutralized them before TB-73 reached the Ord Cestus medical station.",

        "content": "# Rex - Defense of Kamino[]\n\nOnce the battle droids had passed by the cadets' hiding places, Rex commed the young trainees to open fire on the droids, which they did to great effect. As more droids fell in the ensuing crossfire, Cody used up the last of the thermal detonators. Though 99 opted to retrieve another supply of explosives from the armory, his decision to abandon his cover\u2014despite protest from Rex and the others\u2014cost him his life, as he took enemy fire to the back and died. Cody thereafter received word from Ti that the droids had been pushed back to the main hangar. The Republic forces soon secured a victory over the remaining Separatist forces, forcing Grievous and Ventress to retreat. However, the damage had been done: Rex, Cody, Fives, and Echo took some time to lament the loss of 99, whom they believed had been a true soldier in spite of his debilitative cloning malformations. While clone troopers and Kaminoan cloners alike began to repair the desolation wrought throughout Tipoca City, Rex and Cody found Fives and Echo in the Military Complex's hangar and commended them on the true valor they had displayed during the battle. Once again impressed with their efforts, Rex and Cody officially promoted both 501st troopers\u2014who had been only cadets not that long ago\u2014to the prestigious rank of Advanced Recon Commando, saluting the Grand Army's newest ARC troopers.\n\nLater in the war, the Trade Federation blockaded Pantora, suspending all commerce with the system to pressure the Pantorans into an alliance with the Confederacy. While with Skywalker on Coruscant, Rex was with him and Padm\u00e9 Amidala on a landing pad as the latter was preparing to leave the capital aboard her J-type diplomatic barge. The three of them soon received news from Tano that Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe\u2014the daughters of Chi Cho's successor, Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida\u2014had been kidnapped. Skywalker sent his Padawan to aid Riyo Chuchi in investigating the matter, and Tano and Chuchi helped Papanoida rescue his daughters from the Separatists. They restored relations between Pantora and the Trade Federation, repealing the blockade.\n\nWhile on their way to rendezvous with Jedi General Kit Fisto, Rex and Skywalker made a brief stop on Mandalore. The reason for their visit was to drop off Tano, whom the Jedi High Council had delegated\u2014at the request of Satine Kryze\u2014to teach cadet classes at the Royal Academy of Government. Because the world had become engulfed in a black market crisis, Tano's involvement was intended to curb the planet's deeply rooted corruption among its future leaders. After arriving at the Sundari docks aboard an Eta-class shuttle, Rex and another trooper stood by while Kryze and her Prime Minister, Almec, welcomed Skywalker and Tano. With Fisto expecting them, Rex reminded Skywalker of their orders, and they soon left Mandalore to join up with Fisto. Meanwhile, Tano and her students found that Almec was behind the ongoing black market conspiracy and helped Kryze bring him to justice.\n\nShortly after returning to Coruscant, Skywalker was given command of the Third Legion for another assignment. A large-scale civil war had consumed the planet Balith, and in response to an appeal for Republic aid, the Jedi Council tasked Skywalker with intervening in the fighting. While Tano stayed at the Jedi Temple to focus on her studies, Rex and troops from Torrent Company were with Skywalker on a Nu-class attack shuttle, and then boarded a Venator-class Star Destroyer for the voyage to Balith.",

        "content": "# Rex - On the front lines of battle[]\n\nHaving become a foothold of Separatist strength since the onset of the Clone Wars, Felucia was engulfed in conflict for a second time on account of being situated near the valuable hyperlane known as the Perlemian Trade Route. Rex went with Skywalker and Tano to repel the Confederacy from Felucia, leading a clone trooper division of AT-TE walkers into the heart of enemy territory. They encountered squads of battle droids as they went but gained much ground, eventually joining forces with Plo Koon and Commander Wolffe to capture a Confederate outpost, to which General Grievous was sending reinforcements to fortify his hold on the system. As night fell, the Jedi and clones moved their forces to a ridge overlooking the outpost just as a C-9979 landing craft arrived with the droid reinforcements. Koon decided on a three-pronged assault plan to secure the outpost: While Koon and Wolffe attacked the base's left flank, Tano would breach the rear entrance with troops from Wolffe's Wolfpack, a squad within the Grand Army's 104th Battalion. Meanwhile, Rex and Skywalker would spearhead the frontal assault on the station. Once Skywalker's Felucian scouts had found them a secure way to the path leading to the outpost, Rex positioned half of their soldiers amidst the dense foliage on one side of the path, while Skywalker did the same along the other side.\n\nWith all of their forces in place, Koon had their AT-TE walkers deliver long-range fire at the outpost from the ridge. The cannonades baited tactical droid commander TZ-33's droid defenders out of the front entrance, and Rex and Skywalker began their attack once several DSD1 dwarf spider droids had been lured out into the jungle. Rex and Skywalker cut through the battle droids and joined Koon in capturing the base's command center, eliminating TZ-33. Although the enemy station had been secured, Tano was nowhere to be found\u2014unbeknownst to her comrades, Trandoshan hunters had captured her for a ritualistic hunt on the moon Wasskah. Rex and his team received orders to return to Coruscant the next morning. As they prepared to leave Felucia, Skywalker had Rex and his men search the conquered outpost and the surrounding area for Tano several times, to no avail. With gunships waiting for them, Skywalker was forced to call off the search, hoping that Republic forces or spies in the Confederacy would locate his Padawan. Tano was later rescued from Wasskah and safely returned to the Jedi Temple.\n\nFollowing the Second Battle of Felucia, Grievous oversaw a Separatist invasion of the Calamari system, home to the Mon Calamari shipbuilders who were key to the Republic war effort. After the King of Mon Cala, Yos Kolina, was assassinated, Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala were sent to quell the political tensions between the Mon Calamari and the Quarren in the wake of his death, hoping to stem the impending threat of a Mon Calamari\u2013Quarren civil war. Despite their best efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict, Skywalker and Amidala were unable to stop the Quarren from seceding from the Republic in favor of an alliance with Commander Riff Tamson of the Confederacy. Upon learning that civil war on Mon Cala was now inevitable and imminent, the Jedi High Council immediately commissioned a company of clone troopers for underwater combat to prevent the world from falling to Separatist control. Rex, Tano, and Kit Fisto were appointed to oversee the reinforcements for the Mon Calamari. Yet the battle began before they could arrive when Tamson and Quarren chieftain Nossor Ri led an assault on the undersea capital, Mon Calamari City, where Captain Gial Ackbar of the Mon Calamari Guard was hosting Skywalker and Amidala.",

        "content": "# Rex - Bloodshed and rescues[]\n\nAlthough the Kaminoan doctors quickly healed Tano's injuries, Rex, Coric, and several others had to undergo bacta treatment and received their own bacta tanks. Rex and Coric were among those who made full recoveries, though the Kaminoans did not have as much success with some of the other troopers. Eventually, Rex, Coric, Checkers, and the other survivors were discharged and returned to Coruscant's GAR clone barracks on furlough to rest up before their next assignment. Tano arrived at their barracks an hour after their return to welcome them back. She revealed to Rex and Coric that she was concerned for her Master, whose life had been put into grave danger while on a confidential mission with Kenobi. Unable to rescue their generals for the time being, Rex and Coric tried to cheer up Tano with a game of turbo-darts. Since they had not yet received their next orders, Rex only intended to take a few days of recuperation before resuming Torrent Company's training. Their next deployment came within a few days, a day after the Separatists launched a devastating bioweapon attack on the planet Chandrila. Although GAR command did not inform him of their destination, Rex learned about their complete assignment from Tano, who was to accompany them on their mission.\n\nTano explained that Torrent Company was joining a battle group bound for the Separatist-occupied planet Lanteeb to rescue Skywalker and Kenobi, who had been trapped there by forces under the command of General Lok Durd\u2014a recent escapee from Republic incarceration. Durd was manufacturing a damotite-based bioweapon on Lanteeb, which had been responsible for the massacre on Chandrila, and the Republic intended to eliminate the weapon's stockpiles before it could strike again. Admiral Yularen was given command of the armada bound for Lanteeb, and Rex, Tano, and Torrent Company joined him aboard Indomitable, which had undergone repairs following the recapture of Kothlis. Their three-cruiser battle group\u2014again consisting of Indomitable, Pioneer, and Coruscant Sky\u2014received the addition of Mace Windu's Dagger, which came from safeguarding Kothlis in the wake of the Separatist invasion. Upon reaching Lanteeb in the Malor-77 system, the Republic forces found that not only were twenty-five enemy warships heavily blockading Lanteeb, but Grievous himself was leading the blockade. Among their scant good news was that Grievous's communications jammer virus had been temporarily nullified, restoring communications in the interim.\n\nAfter executing three starfighter assaults on Grievous's flotilla, Yularen's battle group received reinforcements in the form of a large volunteer civilian fleet, which Senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Bail Prestor Organa had worked tirelessly to organize in the absence of further support from the Republic Navy. Rex and the 501st prepared to aid in rescuing Skywalker, Kenobi, and Jedi Master Taria Damsin, who had slipped through the blockade to help the trapped generals. With the aid of the civilian ships, Yularen's fleet scattered the blockade, forcing Grievous to retreat. While Yularen oversaw the battle group's efforts to liberate Lanteeb from Separatist control, Rex joined Windu and Tano in leading the 501st and another Grand Army unit, the 95th, to the Lanteeban city Torbel, where Skywalker, Kenobi, and Damsin were desperately defending the local populace from Durd's droid army. The 501st and 95th took a squadron of thirty gunships to Torbel, with clone trooper pilot Jinx transporting Rex and Tano. Once they arrived in Torbel, Rex, Coric, and Checkers joined their comrades in cutting through the battle droids; the Separatist detachment was defeated in under an hour.",

        "content": "# Rex - Infiltration of the Citadel[]\n\nWhen Echo attempted to commandeer the shuttle, one of the platform's droid-manned blaster turrets blew apart the craft. The resulting explosion claimed Echo's life as well as the shuttle. Their only means of escaping off-world now gone with their comrade-in-arms, the Republic team was forced to retreat from the Citadel. Once Skywalker and Kenobi had requested retrieval from Koon and the High Council, Rex and his comrades proceeded away from the prison, across the perilous and barely navigable landscape of Lola Sayu. Rex, Cody, and Fives scouted ahead for the team as they traveled through a series of caves partitioned by rivers of sulfur. Taking advantage of the brief lack of pursuant droids, Piell contacted Yoda and Mace Windu at the Jedi Temple. With Koon's rescue fleet of cruisers already en route to Lola Sayu, Yoda and Windu informed Piell and the others that their rendezvous point with Koon's evacuation ships would be a small island in the middle of a lake of lava. When a trio of droid commandos caught up with them, Fives tossed a thermal detonator, making quick work of their pursuers. Yet Sobeck's forces did not relent in their pursuit and next tried to surround Rex and his comrades at a cliff, with battle droids approaching from the rear and a crab droid attacking from a nearby cliff face.\n\nWhile R2-D2's reprogrammed battle droids delayed Sobeck's forces, Rex and the others used ascension cables to descend the cliff; Rex helped a clone officer down the ridge. Despite losing two troopers, they pressed on along a river of lava leading to the island rendezvous point. The group soon heard distant howling and realized that Sobeck had released a pack of hunters to lead his battle droids to them\u2014specifically, the hunters were dangerous anooba trackers. As the anoobas were not far behind, the Jedi decided to use a nearby cave to their advantage: Once Skywalker and Kenobi had led the anoobas past the cave, Rex, Tano, Piell, and their men would surprise them and their accompanying battle droids from behind. After the anooba pack passed by, Rex and his team rushed to join Skywalker and Kenobi, but several crab droids intercepted them. While Tano and Piell held off the crab droids, Rex pushed on with Tarkin, Cody, and the clones to Skywalker's position, where they found him and Kenobi in battle with the anoobas and a squadron of STAPs. Although the anoobas and droids were defeated, the victory came at a high cost: Piell died in combat with the anoobas. Tano\u2014to whom Piell, with his final breath, had designated his half of the Nexus Route coordinates\u2014brought the body back to the others, who were saddened to learn of the Jedi Councilor's sacrifice.\n\nEven with Sobeck pursuing them, Rex and his comrades paused to honor the fallen Piell, cremating his body in the lava of Lola Sayu. Once Piell had joined with the landscape, the Republic team continued on to the island. With sulfurous lava separating them from the island, Skywalker and Cody each connected a cable to the opposite shore, erecting a line across the magma, and Rex and Tarkin were the first to climb across. As the others traversed the cables, Sobeck personally arrived with a squad of STAP-mounted droid commandos to reclaim his prisoners. A fierce lightfight ensued, with Rex and his men battling Sobeck's forces in a final stand. Unwilling to let the Nexus Route coordinates reach the Republic, Sobeck tried to murder Tarkin, but Tano killed the warden before he could do so. Just as Koon and Clone Commander CC-3636, nicknamed \"Wolffe,\" arrived aboard a gunship to rescue the Republic team, hordes of crab droids appeared and surrounded the Jedi and clones. After providing cover fire for the Jedi, Rex and his men boarded Koon's space gunship and lifted off from Lola Sayu. They and their starfighter escort\u2014provided by Adi Gallia, Saesee Tiin, and Kit Fisto\u2014reached Koon's fleet of Star Destroyers, which withdrew to hyperspace.",

        "content": "# Rex - Bloodshed and rescues[]\n\nWhen the Resolute was scheduled to undergo a refit, Rex and Torrent Company were transferred with Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, and Yularen to the recently christened Star Destroyer Indomitable. Presently, the Jedi and their fleet\u2014including the cruisers Indomitable, Pioneer, and Coruscant Sky\u2014received intelligence from the Grand Army's Special Operations Brigade that General Grievous was planning on seizing Kothlis and its Bothan Spynet facility. While in Indomitable's mess hall, Rex, Sergeant Coric, and trooper Checkers were joined by Tano, who reported that the fleet was heading to mount a defense of Kothlis. Rex learned from Tano that a ground assault on the planet was highly possible; if the Separatists had already begun to invade Kothlis, Kenobi and Tano would be leading the counterattack on the surface while Skywalker commanded the space battle. The captain then put his men on standby and had them begin preparations for the imminent battle. When Indomitable, Pioneer, and Coruscant Sky arrived at Kothlis, they found that Grievous had already begun to beleaguer the undefended planet. The Jedi additionally discovered that Grievous was employing a computer virus to jam all of the Republic's comm channels, terminating ship-to-ship communications.\n\nSkywalker met with Rex, Tano, and their waiting men in their barracks and informed them of the Separatists' comm jammer. Although Rex was concerned with the news, Skywalker stated it was possible that comms would be restored in time; if necessary, reinforcements could be requested. Before proceeding to the gunship hangar with Tano and Torrent Company, Rex wished his general good hunting. Once Skywalker and his Gold Squadron pilots had initiated the space battle against Grievous, Rex and Tano were joined by Kenobi in their gunship and led the assault force's launch from the fleet. En route to the surface of Kothlis, Rex spared his men a few last-minute words for preparation. After landing, Kenobi ordered Rex and Tano into the fray while he led the assault on the Separatist-claimed Spynet facility. Rex, Tano, and Torrent Company engaged the entrenched droid infantry forces in the central plaza of Kothlis's capital, Tal'cara, battling super battle droids, droidekas, and STAP-mounted droids. However, with only one gunship for air support, Torrent Company took heavy losses\u2014their highest since the Battle of Teth.\n\nRex was among the injured, taking wounds to his right arm and chest. Checkers, who was wounded less severely, stood with his captain, ready to support him if he needed it. After the fight against the droids in the plaza reached a temporary standstill, Tano ordered Rex and his men to fall back and tried to contact Yularen for assistance, but her attempt failed due to the Separatists' still-active comm jammer. Seeing no other options, she left to get help from Kenobi while the barely conscious Rex stayed to watch over his men. Tano rendezvoused with Kenobi and assisted him in reclaiming the Spynet facility from the Confederacy, thanks in part to the efforts\u2014and sacrifices\u2014of Torrent Company and other clone units. The Republic fleet also managed to repel Grievous's forces from Kothlis. Rex, Coric, and the other wounded soldiers were sent for treatment at the Republic's Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, one of the Republic Sector Armies' twenty Haven-class medical stations. Tano chose to be treated with them at the Outer Rim medcenter so that she could provide moral support.\n\nAlthough the Kaminoan doctors quickly healed Tano's injuries, Rex, Coric, and several others had to undergo bacta treatment and received their own bacta tanks. Rex and Coric were among those who made full recoveries, though the Kaminoans did not have as much success with some of the other troopers. Eventually, Rex, Coric, Checkers, and the other survivors were discharged and returned to Coruscant's GAR clone barracks on furlough to rest up before their next assignment.

Since they had not yet received their next orders, Rex only intended to take a few days of recuperation before resuming Torrent Company's training. Their next deployment came within a few days, a day after the Separatists launched a devastating bioweapon attack on the planet Chandrila. Although GAR command did not inform him of their destination, Rex learned about their complete assignment from Tano, who was to accompany them on their mission.\n\nTano explained that Torrent Company was joining a battle group bound for the Separatist-occupied planet Lanteeb to rescue Skywalker and Kenobi, who had been trapped there by forces under the command of General Lok Durd\u2014a recent escapee from Republic incarceration. Durd was manufacturing a damotite-based bioweapon on Lanteeb, which had been responsible for the massacre on Chandrila, and the Republic intended to eliminate the weapon's stockpiles before it could strike again.

While Yularen oversaw the battle group's efforts to liberate Lanteeb from Separatist control, Rex joined Windu and Tano in leading the 501st and another Grand Army unit, the 95th, to the Lanteeban city Torbel, where Skywalker, Kenobi, and Damsin were desperately defending the local populace from Durd's droid army.

Once they arrived in Torbel, Rex, Coric, and Checkers joined their comrades in cutting through the battle droids; the Separatist detachment was defeated in under an hour.\n\nAs Windu coordinated the Republic's various mopping-up operations, the sun began to set on Lanteeb, so Rex arranged for the floodlighted gunships to be positioned around the village square for additional light. Since the battle had reduced Torbel to little more than ruins, the Republic granted the villagers refugee status, and Amidala and Queen Jamillia offered to give them homes on Naboo. While Windu stayed behind to discuss the civilians' future with the village speaker, Rikkard, Rex and a clone medic escort shuttled Tano and the extremely injured Skywalker, Kenobi, and Damsin to Indomitable for proper medical treatment. Windu then took Skywalker, Kenobi, and Damsin back to Coruscant aboard Dagger, with Rex and Tano being entrusted with overseeing the remainder of the Republic's operations on Lanteeb with the 501st Legion.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Force powers\n\nGifted with raw Force skill, Tano at first was only skilled at sensing the intentions and emotions of those around her, although she was able to advance in more skills once her training began. She was noted by her master to possess advanced abilities. At the beginning of her apprenticeship, Tano was capable of telekinetic feats as evidenced during the Battle of Christophsis, where she pulled down a large wall in order to save Skywalker from a group of retail droids. In another instance, Tano strongly pushed Ventress and flung her back some distance in order to save the life of Luminara Unduli. By the end of the Clone Wars, Tano's telekinetic abilities advanced to the point that she was able to hold Maul aloft high above the city of Sundari and could use the Force to prevent a small starship from taking off. During Order 66, she was able to use the Force to guide her two lightsabers in a circle to cut an escape path for her and Rex. Tano later proved able to create a powerful protective Force barrier that was capable of temporarily holding back fiery dark side energies conjured by Darth Sidious.\n\nTano also had a strong ability to sense things in the Force, feeling the presence of Plo Koon after his fleet was destroyed by the Malevolence and the presences of the children who were kidnapped by Cad Bane. She also eventually learned how to perform mind tricks. Tano would sometimes use a Force choke, despite it being a dark side Force power, but relied on it mostly to temporarily fend off an enemy. She used this method against a Trandoshan hunter on Wasskah, prompting her companion Kalifa to use it as well. However, when Kalifa did not let go and began to threaten to kill the hunter, Tano convinced her to let the Trandoshan go, saying it was not the Jedi way to kill out of anger.\n\nIn addition, Tano's Force powers enabled her to leap to incredible heights. She used this to her advantage when leaping into the Phantom in order to escape two Inquisitors. She frequently used her acrobatic prowess during lightsaber combat, using front flips, back flips, and somersaults to avoid enemy attacks. During a duel against General Grievous, she vaulted herself on top of the cyborg general before springing off his back and escaping. Ultimately, thanks to her skill in the Force, she was never weaponless, as she could always call upon its power.\n\nTano also experienced Force visions and dreams. She used the Force to heal two corrupted kyber crystals that had been \"bled red\" and restored them to their natural white color. These crystals became part of her new twin lightsabers. Tano was also able to use the Force to amplify her touch. On one occasion, she used this Force power to shatter the hilt of the Sixth Brother's double-bladed spinning lightsaber.\n\nTano also demonstrated the ability to sense the thoughts and feelings of others. When she met Grogu, Tano was able to sense his thoughts to such a precise degree that she was able to deduce his name and that he had been trained as a Jedi youngling at the Temple on Coruscant. Tano possessed the rare ability known as psychometry, which allowed its users to learn the history related to an object by coming into contact with it.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The fearless Force-sensitive\n\nAhsoka Tano was a Togruta female who had blue eyes, dark orange skin, brownish-grey lips, white facial markings, a slender build, and white lekku and montrals with blue stripes. The markings on her montrals were unique, and her montrals continued to grow as she matured. During her early childhood, Tano's trust in others was negatively impacted by a Jedi imposter who tried to enslave her, and the memory of the scorn her fellow villagers felt towards her remained with her until her trip to Ilum; upon trusting Master Yoda, she felt that trust came easier to her because she was again trusting her own instincts. The teachings and values of the Jedi Order became sacred to her, and she always sought to protect the lives of innocents.\n\nAs a teenager, Tano was snarky, cocky, stubborn, reckless, and impulsive, yet also brave, loyal, generous, and kind-hearted. The young Tano's emotions made her a perfect apprentice for Anakin Skywalker, with Grand Master Yoda himself recognizing that the two became \"twice the trouble\" after being paired together. She was very feisty and snippy, earning her the nickname \"Snips\" from her master. Like her master, she could at times become aggressive and willing to use terror or threats to get the answers she wanted. She had a tendency to follow her heart, which negatively impacted her path to Jedi knighthood. In her younger years, Tano's emotions inhibited her ability to make wise decisions, although she eventually gained the confidence to make the right ones, despite the great cost to her feelings. Beyond learning from both Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the teachings of Qui-Gon Jinn were indirectly passed down to Tano.\n\nOver time, Tano became more mature and enlightened, with her experiences during the Clone Wars shaping her into someone who could control her emotions. She had her victories, her failures, and her losses yet strove through them all, as she felt it was her duty as a Jedi to help restore peace and prosperity to the Republic. Her constant travels and experiences made her more worldly than most people her age, and often she was surprised by the various events and people she came across during the Clone Wars. Throughout her time as a Jedi, she remained close with Plo Koon, who had brought her to the Jedi Temple, and saw him as an important mentor in her life. She also developed a friendships with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his second-in-command, Cody, as well as Senator Amidala through her master, Anakin Skywalker.\n\nShe respected Yoda despite often not understanding his advice, feeling he was almost always correct. However, when Tano was framed for murder and treason, she was horrified when the Jedi Order cast her out and all but condemned her to a Republic military tribunal, and came very close to being sentenced to death. When Skywalker unveiled the true culprit, Tano was shocked to see it was her friend Barriss Offee. Though conflicted, she ultimately rejected the opportunity to become a Jedi again, having lost faith in the Order for not standing by her.\n\nTano formed a strong bond with the clones, especially Captain Rex, and throughout her time as serving as their commander had learned a lot from them. She respected the clones as individuals and got along with them very well. Tano quickly began to enjoy their company, telling war stories with them as soon as she had any experience to speak on. When Tano found herself serving with the clones of the 501st again at the Siege of Mandalore, the clones continued to salute her out of respect and even repainted their helmets in her likeness to show how much she meant to them. When Order 66 turned the friends she had served with for years into enemies, Tano stood by her beliefs and told Rex to not kill them, determined to escape without directly killing her former comrades. When the ship crashed into the moon, Tano returned to the crash site to dig graves for each clone.\n\nTano was a confident and moralistic person, and a firm defender of the innocent. This carried on even after she left the Order, as she joined Bail Organa's rebellion to restore liberty and democracy to the people oppressed by the Empire. Tano also felt pity and compassion for the Inquisitor known as the Sixth Brother despite slaying him in combat. She regarded the Sixth Brother as a victim whose potential for good had been twisted and turned to the dark side. After befriending the Force-sensitive Hedala Fardi, Tano became concerned with protecting Force-sensitive children from being captured by the Empire's Inquisitors. During her time with the Martez sisters shortly before the end of the war, they noted that she still acted like a Jedi even though she was no longer a member of the order.\n\nDuring her time running from the Empire, Tano continued to suffer from grief over the loss of her friends and guilt over the fact that she wasn't there to help them. During her time on Raada, Tano was unsure about making new friends, largely due to the emotional pain inflicted by Offee's betrayal. Despite everything Offee had done, Tano believed that while she was wrong about \"a lot of things,\" she did have a point about the Jedi and the Republic, and later expressed her belief that if had they truly listened to her, they might have been able to stop Darth Sidious before it was too late. When Tano began to help people hurt by the Empire, she felt better about herself and as though she was fulfilling her training to do justice, feeling even better because her work was hurting the Empire that hurt her. She felt as though she had been a hero in her past and was one again, although she knew she needed to try to avoid tapping into her reckless nature. She decided to find a middle path to life when she became a rebel, not becoming a Jedi again but also not allowing her heart to harden when faced with the death of friends.\n\nIn addition to knowing friends would die in war, she knew it could change people, having spent her life as a Padawan fighting as a soldier instead of working as a peace keeper. Thus, she came to hate warfare, with her distaste for it making her notice that the fourteen year old Miara Larte had altered her behavior to avoid the Empire's patrols. In fact, she believed that, just because she had started to fight in the Clone Wars at that age, it was not a good example for Larte. Even as Imperial forces closed in, she found that meditation was easy for her, yet she also recognized she had nothing to say to the Empire's troops on Raada, not even using banter or taunts. Upon meeting Senator Organa for the second time, she noticed when he said his daughter took after her mother, yet she failed to answer the test she suspected the words were; Leia was secretly the daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, but Tano elected to move past the subject, knowing Organa and her would need to trust each other despite each other's secrets.\n\nAs a rebel Informant code-named \"Fulcrum,\" Tano worked indirectly with various rebel cells, always with her face hidden and her voice disguised, and became somewhat pragmatic as she advised Hera Syndulla to cease searching for Kanan Jarrus to protect her crew, especially Ezra Bridger. This may suggest she developed a more discreet nature and decided overall to put the many before the few. When Tano was saved and reunited with Bridger in the World Between Worlds, she was saddened to learn of the fate of Jarrus, but disturbed by Bridger's idea of saving Jarrus from dying. Drawing from her own experience of being unable to save her master, Tano successfully convinced Bridger to let Jarrus go, and they parted ways, promising to find each other again as Tano went back to Malachor and resumed her journey.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Tano sought to keep her promise to Bridger and joined his former companion Sabine Wren in her quest to find him and bring him home. At that time, she had adopted a more stoic persona. However, after the Force spirit of Skywalker gave her a final lesson and her decision to live, her personality returned to a more lively state.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Searching for Grand Admiral Thrawn\n\nConcerned about Thrawn's possible return, Tano interrogated Morgan Elsbeth for any information regarding Thrawn, his intentions, and how to find him. Elsbeth ended up revealing the location of a map to the alleged location of Thrawn in the galaxy of Peridea. Elsbeth was delivered to New Republic custody after her capture as well.\n\nTano soon began searching the ruins of an ancient stronghold on Arcana. She soon approached a runic circle in the middle of the stony courtyard and used her twin lightsabers to cut a hole below her feet, allowing her to access to the chamber underneath. Tano gazed at several cloaked figures carved onto the wall, before walking over to a pillar, and using Psychometry on it. Sensing that it was the key to retrieving the map, the former Jedi rotated a part of it, before then rotating the tip of it, which caused an orb next to one of the carvings to glow. Tano smirked, before moving over to a second pillar. After rotating a part of the second pillar, she watched an orb in the heart of one of the other carved figures to glow. She then rotated a part of a third pillar, causing a third orb to glow, and an altar with a rectangular stony object to rise from the floor. Tano touched the stony box, which had crumbled and revealed a golden orb. She had informed Professor Huyang that she had found the object via comlink, but his transmissions had been jammed.\n\nTano soon returned to the surface where she was confronted by a red HK assassin droid, who had demanded the map. She had found herself surrounded by five assassin droids wielding electrostaffs. Tano had drawn her twin lightsabers in defense. Tano had jumped back into the hole she had created and had used her lightsaber to cut holes between three of the droids. Tano then fought the other two and had cut across the torso with her lightsaber. She had beheaded the fifth droid. As two droids had emerged from their holes, the lead droid had issued orders to initiate their self-destruct protocols. The other two droids had complied, and Tano had been forced to flee. While running, she had contacted Huyang, who had told her that their T-6 Jedi shuttle was above her position. She had told him to drop his ramp at a distance outside the ruins. The two had escaped before they could be killed by the fiery inferno that had swept through the ruins.\n\nInside the cockpit, Tano had conversed with Huyang about their communication difficulty. He had told her that he had kept her ship at a safe distance in accordance with Jedi mission protocol. She had replied that the Jedi Order didn't exist anymore. When Huyang had said he had his programming, she had advised him to stick close and watch her back. Huyang had replied that it was the job of a Jedi Padawan learner, which he was not. Tano had told Huyang that he had found the map based on Elsbeth's information. When Huyang had asked how she had gotten Elsbeth to tell the truth, Tano had replied that she hadn't been following Jedi protocol.\n\nNot long afterwards, they received an incoming transmission from New Republic Fleet Command, who told Tano and Huyang about the recent attack from Baylan Skoll and his apprentice Shin Hati to rescue Morgan Elsbeth. Tano and Huyang then traveled to Home One via hyperspace. Tano identified their ship as T-6 1974, and Fleet Command cleared them to land at hangar 2-9. Inside the hangar, General Hera Syndulla greeted them and informed them about the loss of Elsbeth.\n\nSyndulla had prepared a briefing for Tano to catch up. In the briefing, Syndulla told Tano and Huyang about the damage the two mercenaries had done, taking out an entire security detail and scuttling a new starship. Tano was unfamiliar with the attackers, who had demonstrated Force powers similar to the Jedi. Huyang suggested that one of these intruders had once been a Jedi. Tano told Huyang to scan Skoll's and Shin\u2019s lightsabers.\n\nWhen Syndulla asked about the mercenaries' connection to Elsbeth, Tano said that she had hired them for plausible deniability. Tano also showed Syndulla the golden orb, explaining that Elsbeth had been interested in this map since she believed it would lead to the location of Thrawn, the last Imperial Grand Admiral. Syndulla was surprised that Thrawn had survived the Battle of Lothal, but Tano explained that she had heard whispers of his survival. Syndulla asked if this meant that Ezra Bridger was alive. Tano was uncertain but warned that their enemies were also searching.\n\nSyndulla wanted to look at the map, but the key required to activate the map eluded Huyang. Syndulla remarked that it was never straightforward with the Jedi. A Mon Calamari officer informed Syndulla that the Defense Council was requesting an update from her. Syndulla said she would attend to the matter and told Tano she knew who could help her. Tano was uncertain that this friend would help, but Syndulla reassured her that she would do it for Bridger.\n\nLater that day, Governor Ryder Azadi gave a speech to the citizens of Lothal, celebrating the aniiversary of its liberation shortly before the Galactic Civil War. Still residing on Lothal, Sabine Wren, who was set to speak to Lothals community, failed to appear at the celebration, instead returning to the communications tower. Tano soon arrived on the planet, and parked her T-6 shuttle near a ledge on a high tower. Wren arrived while Tano was talking to Governor Azadi. When Azadi said that Wren had missed the ceremony yesterday, Wren replied that it had slipped her mind. Azadi said everyone had missed her, but Wren replied that not everyone had been there. Huyang also greeted Sabine, who recognized him. Huyang said he still had 75 percent original parts before returning to the ship. Azadi told Wren to listen to what Tano had to say before leaving. Tano then told Wren that she knew a way to find Bridger while showing her the orb.\n\nThe two went inside Ahsoka's T-6 Jedi shuttle and discussed the situation. Wren gazed at a bunk with several wall drawings, including a loth-cat. When Wren asked if she was certain Bridger was still out there, Tano responded that whilst nothing was certain, their enemy was seeking Thrawn, which was what had led her to the map. Tano explained she had found the map on the planet Arcana, a Nightsister stronghold thousands of years ago. Due to her skills as an artist, Tano sought Wren's help in deciphering the map. Wren believed there was a code. Tano shared a scan of the Nightsister temple chamber where they had found it. When questioned about where home was, Tano described her soul as a home. Both women blamed each other for not making it easy for each other. Tano replied that the Jedi way was hard.\n\nJust then, Huyang had an update. Wren asked for permission to take the map and study it. Tano refused since she believed the map was not just about finding Bridger but preventing another war. She warned Wren that the map stayed aboard the ship before entering the lab to chat with Huyang. Huyang had scanned Skoll's and Hati's lightsabers. The droid said that he recognized one of the two hilts, which was built in the Jedi style. The one he knew belonged to Baylan Skoll, who had disappeared at the end of the Clone Wars. Huyang told Ahsoka that Skoll had been Jedi trained. Tano surmised that Hati was Skoll's apprentice. He warned Tano that Skoll wouldn't be alone for long. When Tano returned to the briefing room, Wren had already left with the map despite Tano's instructions.\n\nIn the meantime, Wren rode her speeder bike back to the old communications tower. A probe droid then popped out from behind a signal crossing and reported back to Hati and two HK assassin droids, who stood miles away on a hilltop. Upon returning, the Mandalorian began to study the compass. Back on Ahsoka's T-6, Tano and Huyang spoke to General Syndulla about Wren via holoprojector. Tano was worried about Wren, but Syndulla told her to give her some space. Syndulla believed that Wren was their best chance of reading the map. Tano admitted she had a difficult relationship with Wren, describing the Mandalorian as stubborn and bullish. Syndulla attributed these traits to her Mandalorian background and said that mentoring could be a challenge, suggesting that Anakin Skywalker may have found her difficult sometimes. Tano said that she had walked away from her Jedi training and admitted walking away from Wren.\n\nMeanwhile, Wren was still trying to solve the puzzle of the star map back in her home. Soon, she began to understand how to translate it, before fully managing to do so. Just as Wren looked out over the balcony afterwards, she was attacked by the Empire. She soon contacted Tano before engaging in a fight. Huyang soon interrupted, informing the pair that they had received communications from Wren, who was being hunted down by HK droids led by Shin Hati. Tano and Huyang soon piloted the ship, and flew towards Wrens tower. As Hati and Wren dueled, the former stabbed Wren through the abdomen, leaving her completely wounded. Upon seeing the ship arrive, Hati fled with the map, as Tano quickly tended to Wren who lay on the floor dying. Wren was soon brought on board by Tano and Huyang, where she was set to receive urgent medical attention.\n\nAfter rescuing Sabine, Ahsoka had her placed in emergency care. With the help of Bacta, Sabine healed quickly and managed to recover enough to tell Ashoka what she knew. She said she had unlocked it, and there was an image of two galaxies with a passway between them. Telling her to get some rest, Ahsoka walked outside and recalled past events while glancing at Sabine\u2019s speederbike and helmet. She then walked over to the old communications tower and glanced at the loth cat and equipment inside. She walked over and played an old hologram of Ezra when one of the assassin droids jumped down to attack her. Swiftly decapitating it, she brought it back to Sabine.\n\nThe mandalorian said she could use the backup systems to perhaps access its memory banks, but an incorrect power level would detonate the head. Huyang suggested that this operation be moved somewhere else, but Hera, who was on a hologram watching, and Ahsoka disagreed, believing that time was of the essence. Sabine managed to discover that it was from Corellia at the New Republic Shipyards. before Huyang disconnected power to prevent an explosion. Ahsoka stated that there were factories owned by Morgan Elsbeth, and Hera said that they should\u2019ve been shut down after the war and she would meet her there.\n\nHera and Ahsoka left for Corellia's shipyards after realizing that Morgan Elsbeth had owned manufacturing plants there. Hera met with one of the Regional Supervisors, Myn Weaver, to discuss possible Imperial remnant activity. Weaver stated that he was particularly busy at the moment, but Syndulla pressed him, stating that this would be a far more formal investigation if she could not do so immediately. Weaver took them on a REV-2K personnel carrier through the production plant, telling them the insides of his operation. During the ride, he was questioned on the loyalty of his workers (most of them had been employed by the Empire) to which he replied that average workers did not care about galactic politics. After this, Hera suggested that Tano take Sabine back on as an apprentice. Tano replied that neither of them was ready for that. Still, Hera believed it would be good for both of them, saying that Wren needed some structure in her life and so did Tano.\n\nOnce Myn Weaver showed them into the control center, Tano asked about the purpose and clients of the manufacturing center. While Weaver was explaining the priority given to shareholders, Hera spotted a massive hyperdrive core. Weaver explained that it had been extracted from a Super Star Destroyer. Hera was befuddled since the New Republic had not been constructing anything of that size. Weaver checked the logs and explained that it was of a classified nature and that it needed approval before he could unseal it. The supervisor asked for the protocol droid C1-D1 to explain the regulations surrounding it. Tano questioned him on the other types of droids in use, but the protocol droid interjected by stating that she had been interrupted by an HK earlier. The protocol droid stated that it was on the transport about to leave with the massive hyperspace core. Hera ordered the flight crew to stop the ship from leaving the planet, but the crew, and even Myn Weaver, had been Imperial loyalists the entire time.\n\nSeveral drew pistols in an attempt to kill the general, but Tano's lightning-fast reflexes had dispatched all of them in seconds. Hera rushed to the Phantom II to stop the transport as soon as possible. Tano leaped out of the window, sprinting towards the rapidly ascending transport, but an assassin droid and a former Imperial Inquisitor named Marrok, who was working for Elsbeth as a mercenary, stood in her way. They dueled, with Ahsoka defeating the droid as Marrok received a transmission telling him to leave. He hurled his lightsaber as Ahsoka flipped over it, and ran to a shuttle picking him up. The shuttle opened fire on Ahsoka, who dodged everything, including Marrok's lightsaber which flew back to him. She called Hera, hoping for good news, and was relieved to hear that Chopper had gotten a tracking device on the transport.\n\nHera and Ahsoka later watched over the Imperial sympathizers' arrests and commented on how it was greed, not loyalty, that made them do this. Ahsoka returned to Sabine at the Mural on Lothal, commenting on her haircut. Huyang reported that the tracking device was in the Denab System and orbiting Seatos. The trio got moving on their ship and made the jump to hyperspace, with Ahsoka instructing Sabine to launch the hyperdrive, calling her \"Padawan.\"\n\nWhile in route to Seatos, Sabine practiced with Huyang as Ahsoka watched. Her performance was mediocre, but she had still remembered the basics. Ahsoka claimed that the basics were from her Mandalorian upbringing, but that she needed to train the mind, not the body. They then trained with Sabine blinded with a visor, relying only on her other senses. Ahsoka then proceeded to easily outwit and outmaneuver the unaware and frustrated Sabine. Huyang was caustic, claiming she was the worst Jedi he had ever trained(which was nearly all of them).\n\nAfter the practice session, Ahsoka consoled Sabine and told her it would take time. Sabine was still frustrated, hoping that their urgent situation would somehow hasten her aptitude for the force. Tano reminded her that all living beings were in the Force, and that talent was only one aspect of its mastery. Force-pulling a cup over, she urged her to start with small objects. While in the cockpit, Huyang reminded Tano that Sabine would not have been accepted into the old Order and that very few mandalorians ever became Jedi. Hera then called and told them that the mission was not approved by the committee.\n\nAs she elaborated, the ship entered the Denab System, and the comms began to break down due to jamming. A squadron of Morgan\u2019s starfighters, commanded by Shin Hati, flew in behind them and began to fire on the T-6. Sabine ran to the gun and took out several fighters. Coordinating with Wren, Ahsoka flew towards the planet and dove at Sabine\u2019s timing. This allowed Sabine to be able to get several shots off, missing them. She did redeem herself shortly and destroyed one craft. Now in the orbit of the planet, Sabine managed to destroy two more fighters. As this happened, they came into sight of the Eye of Sion. Huyang correctly guessed that it was a massive Hyperspace Ring. When they came into range, Elsbeth opened fire with turbolasers as the fighters pulled back. Huyang insisted on getting a scan. As soon as he completed it, they were struck by a direct hit, crippling the hit and short-circuiting Huyang.\n\nShin and Marrok swung back around to finish the job. Sabine quickly ran a diagnostics and did what she could to recover. Ahsoka donned a space suit and deflected shots with her lightsaber on the exterior of the shuttle. She sliced the wing off one that came too close but was propelled off the hull. As Sabine repaired the ship, Ahsoka climbed back in and ordered her to punch it. They fled down to the planet\u2019s surface, evading the fighters behind a school of Purrgil in the clouds. The two landed in a forest to do repairs, and Huyang woke up at this point. Trying to evade detection, Sabine shut down the power of the ship, while Ahsoka turned Huyang back off. Marrok and Shin Hati\u2019s fighters flew overhead but could not find them, believing them to be hidden in the forest.\n\n",

Following the Battle of Crait in 34 ABY, Tano was mentioned in Galactic Explorer's Guide, a book written by her old enemy and ally Hondo Ohnaka. The book recounted that Jedi Master Luminara Unduli had been a mentor to Tano.\n\nDuring the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY, the last Jedi, Rey, fell in combat against the resurrected Darth Sidious, her grandfather, who had drained the life energy from the young woman. In a moment of tranquility, Rey heard the voices of Ahsoka Tano and the departed Jedi who had come before her. The Jedi spirits gave words of encouragement to Rey, allowing her to muster the strength to rise and ultimately defeat Sidious.\n\nLong after the reign of Darth Sidious, when a member of the Whills began recording galactic history for an audience living in a faraway galaxy into the Journal of the Whills, another Whill mentioned Ahsoka Tano as someone to be remembered.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - After Anakin's death\n\nIn 4 ABY, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force and sacrificed his own life to defeat Darth Sidious at the Battle of Endor. Following her master's death, Tano reflected on the impact of Anakin's decisions on the galaxy. Despite his flaws, she remembered him as \"the best of us,\" a good man who fell victim to his own fears, and had favorable things to say about him. In 9 ABY, she refused to train the youngling Grogu because she recognized that the child's attachment to his father figure Din Djarin made him vulnerable to the same fears as Anakin. Tano could not bring herself to separate the infant from Djarin, vowing to not set him down the same self-destructive path as her old friend. However, she relented and told Djarin of Tython, a place where Grogu could reach out with the Force to contact other Jedi if he chose to.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given her close relation to the Skywalker family, Tano met Anakin Skywalker's son Luke Skywalker at some point. In fact, when asked how she knew of his temple, she only answered that she was an old friend to the Skywalker family. Tano and Skywalker were on good terms. She even advised him in the training of Grogu, such as telling the young Skywalker to trust his instincts, and accepted his decision to train the youngling despite her own lack of desire to do so. She would even declare that being by Skywalker's side was the safest place in the galaxy for a young Force-sensitive like Grogu. While she still did not consider herself a Jedi, she had faith that Skywalker would create a \"great school\" and kept Djarin from seeing Grogu, as per Jedi rules on attachment. She favorably referenced Anakin to his son by noting they were similar and did not rule out seeing Luke again. In the World Between Worlds, Anakin appeared to Tano as his younger self to complete her training.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Vader's nemesis\n\nDuring the Siege of Mandalore, Tano learned from Maul that Skywalker had been groomed for years to become the apprentice of Darth Sidious, but she refused to trust the Zabrak, defiantly believing that she knew her master. After Maul's capture, Tano attempted to speak with Skywalker but was unable to make contact with him. Later, she was able to feel his fall to the dark side through the Force, hearing him call out in anguish after attacking Mace Windu. She had no time to process these events before the execution of Order 66, forcing her to go into hiding. Although she did not know the fate of her master, she remembered him fondly, never forgetting the compassion and kindness Anakin offered to the galaxy.\n\nIn 14 BBY, Darth Sidious partnered Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Darth Vader on a mission to investigate attacks on supply lines for the early Death Star. Sidious recalled Tarkin's prosecution at Ahsoka's trial as harming the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and then-Admiral Tarkin, and surmised that despite the Jedi's transformation into a Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader still harbored resentment against Tarkin for his treatment of his former Padawan.\n\nDuring her time with the Spectres, Tano was stationed aboard the Phoenix Home when the Rebel fleet was attacked by the Sith Lord Darth Vader. During the battle, Tano sensed the anger and hatred emanating from the dark sider, and she was met with the realization that the individual behind Vader's mask was Skywalker. The incongruity of the two men being the same caused Tano to lose consciousness. In the aftermath of this discovery, Tano struggled to accept the truth. Although she maintained that she was unaware of the Sith Lord's identity, she secretly harbored feelings of grief and guilt, haunted by the idea that she could have helped her master in his time of need. During a mission to the Jedi Temple on Lothal, Tano was confronted by a vision of Skywalker that preyed upon these fears, blaming her for allowing Darth Vader to rise. Tano fought back against the vision, believing that there was still a way to reach her master.\n\nUpon finally coming face-to-face with her former master once again on Malachor, Tano refused to believe that he and Vader were the same person; she was unable to reconcile the Sith Lord's vile nature with the kindness of the man she once knew. Although it pained her, Tano viewed Vader as the murderer of Anakin Skywalker and vowed to avenge her master's death, going against the Jedi teachings she had learned as a child. She battled him atop the Sith Temple, defending the Padawan Ezra Bridger. As the Temple began to collapse, Tano damaged Vader's mask, revealing the scorched face of Skywalker. The sight of her master forced her to pause. Feeling the guilt from leaving him years ago, Tano refused to leave Vader and continued to duel as her friends escaped. Before the debris of the ceiling could crush them both, Tano destroyed the floor beneath them, causing Vader to fall.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Searching for Grand Admiral Thrawn\n\nOnce Myn Weaver showed them into the control center, Tano asked about the purpose and clients of the manufacturing center. While Weaver was explaining the priority given to shareholders, Hera spotted a massive hyperdrive core. Weaver explained that it had been extracted from a Super Star Destroyer. Hera was befuddled since the New Republic had not been constructing anything of that size. Weaver checked the logs and explained that it was of a classified nature and that it needed approval before he could unseal it. The supervisor asked for the protocol droid C1-D1 to explain the regulations surrounding it. Tano questioned him on the other types of droids in use, but the protocol droid interjected by stating that she had been interrupted by an HK earlier. The protocol droid stated that it was on the transport about to leave with the massive hyperspace core. Hera ordered the flight crew to stop the ship from leaving the planet, but the crew, and even Myn Weaver, had been Imperial loyalists the entire time.\n\nSeveral drew pistols in an attempt to kill the general, but Tano's lightning-fast reflexes had dispatched all of them in seconds. Hera rushed to the Phantom II to stop the transport as soon as possible. Tano leaped out of the window, sprinting towards the rapidly ascending transport, but an assassin droid and a former Imperial Inquisitor named Marrok, who was working for Elsbeth as a mercenary, stood in her way. They dueled, with Ahsoka defeating the droid as Marrok received a transmission telling him to leave. He hurled his lightsaber as Ahsoka flipped over it, and ran to a shuttle picking him up. The shuttle opened fire on Ahsoka, who dodged everything, including Marrok's lightsaber which flew back to him. She called Hera, hoping for good news, and was relieved to hear that Chopper had gotten a tracking device on the transport.\n\nHera and Ahsoka later watched over the Imperial sympathizers' arrests and commented on how it was greed, not loyalty, that made them do this. Ahsoka returned to Sabine at the Mural on Lothal, commenting on her haircut. Huyang reported that the tracking device was in the Denab System and orbiting Seatos. The trio got moving on their ship and made the jump to hyperspace, with Ahsoka instructing Sabine to launch the hyperdrive, calling her \"Padawan.\"\n\nWhile in route to Seatos, Sabine practiced with Huyang as Ahsoka watched. Her performance was mediocre, but she had still remembered the basics. Ahsoka claimed that the basics were from her Mandalorian upbringing, but that she needed to train the mind, not the body. They then trained with Sabine blinded with a visor, relying only on her other senses. Ahsoka then proceeded to easily outwit and outmaneuver the unaware and frustrated Sabine. Huyang was caustic, claiming she was the worst Jedi he had ever trained(which was nearly all of them).\n\nAfter the practice session, Ahsoka consoled Sabine and told her it would take time. Sabine was still frustrated, hoping that their urgent situation would somehow hasten her aptitude for the force. Tano reminded her that all living beings were in the Force, and that talent was only one aspect of its mastery. Force-pulling a cup over, she urged her to start with small objects. While in the cockpit, Huyang reminded Tano that Sabine would not have been accepted into the old Order and that very few mandalorians ever became Jedi. Hera then called and told them that the mission was not approved by the committee.\n\nAs she elaborated, the ship entered the Denab System, and the comms began to break down due to jamming. A squadron of Morgan\u2019s starfighters, commanded by Shin Hati, flew in behind them and began to fire on the T-6. Sabine ran to the gun and took out several fighters. Coordinating with Wren, Ahsoka flew towards the planet and dove at Sabine\u2019s timing. This allowed Sabine to be able to get several shots off, missing them. She did redeem herself shortly and destroyed one craft. Now in the orbit of the planet, Sabine managed to destroy two more fighters. As this happened, they came into sight of the Eye of Sion. Huyang correctly guessed that it was a massive Hyperspace Ring. When they came into range, Elsbeth opened fire with turbolasers as the fighters pulled back. Huyang insisted on getting a scan. As soon as he completed it, they were struck by a direct hit, crippling the hit and short-circuiting Huyang.",

        "content": "# Rex - Wartime assignments[]\n\nRex joined Skywalker and Tano in contesting the Confederacy's claim to the jungle planet Zeenada, where a large Separatist invasion force soon outgunned them. In response, Skywalker had Rex and Tano take a squad around the battle droid lines and stage a diversionary assault on the enemy's rear position. Doing so would cause the Separatists to believe that the Republic's main force was behind them, allowing Skywalker to capture the droids in a pincer maneuver. While circling around the enemy infantry, Rex and Tano encountered a droid patrol. By the time the droids had been eliminated, only Rex, Tano, and two other troopers\u2014Gunner and Sarge\u2014remained of their squad. Rex advised that they abort the mission and return to Skywalker for reinforcements, but Tano reminded them that Skywalker was depending on them to fulfill their objective. When they came across a wild feline predator, Tano ordered Rex, Gunner, and Sarge to avoid firing at it unless absolutely necessary while she distracted the creature. Yet she was unable to defeat the predator, and when she felt the ground shaking underneath them, she quickly Force-pushed Rex and the others aside. The threat turned out to be an incoming pack of wild animals, but Rex and the others were able to avoid the stampede.\n\nAlthough Sarge and Gunner were skeptical of Tano's experience on the battlefield, Rex ordered them to respect her command, as she was in charge. They proceeded through the Zeenada jungle, eventually arriving at a swamp right behind the Separatists' rear flank. Rex was not enthusiastic about having to trudge through the swamp, but Tano believed that they could cross it via several rocks running through the marsh. However, the rocks\u2014which were actually reptilian eggs\u2014turned out to be yet another example of Zeenada's native wildlife: They hatched into massive swamp beasts, whose parent proceeded to attack Tano. While Tano ordered Rex and his men to safety, she had the idea to lure the beast onto the battlefield to attack the battle droids. Her plan worked, and while Skywalker ordered his forces to assault the droids' frontal flank, Rex, Gunner, and Sarge crossed the swamp and jumped into battle alongside Tano.\n\nWhen Republic Admiral Tenant and the crew of his Star Destroyer crew intercepted a message containing a 2,000-year-old Jedi distress code, the Jedi High Council sent Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi to investigate the location of its origin: the remote Chrelythiumn system, a site far beyond the Outer Rim Territories in the relatively unexplored region of the galaxy termed Wild Space. Since the Jedi Council suspected a Separatist scheme, Rex was dispatched aboard a heavily armed Venator-class Star Destroyer to meet up with the three Jedi at the source. Although both Rex's Star Destroyer and Skywalker's Eta-class shuttle arrived at the rendezvous point and established contact via the HoloNet, a peculiar situation arose: Neither Rex's cruiser nor the Jedi's shuttle were able to locate each other on their scanners. The peculiarity of the situation escalated when an outside source cut off Skywalker's holographic connection to the warship. While the concerned Rex continued his attempts to locate them, the Father\u2014a powerful Force wielder who maintained the mysterious world known as Mortis\u2014transported Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi there. The Father wished to test Skywalker, who was believed to be the Chosen One of an ancient Jedi prophecy.\n\nAfter Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi underwent a series of tribulations on Mortis, they awoke aboard their shuttle. Seeing their craft reappear on his scanners, Rex reestablished holographic contact with them, confirming that they were all right. Although Rex did not understand when Skywalker stated that their communications blackout had lasted for more than a moment, Skywalker, commenting that they could not explain their ordeal, brought in their shuttle to join Rex aboard his Star Destroyer.",

        "content": "# Rex - Defense of Kamino[]\n\nThe Republic discovered from an intercepted transmission between General Grievous and Asajj Ventress that Grievous was plotting to stage another invasion of Kamino, mere months after his last attempt had been thwarted at Rishi Station. Examining the message aboard the Resolute, where the 501st had been stationed, Rex, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody learned of Grievous's plan to cripple Kamino, a prospect that both Rex and Cody found quite personal. To notify Kamino of the impending threat and aid in the defense of the critical world, Skywalker and Kenobi set course for Kamino. En route, Rex met with his 501st troops in the Resolute's hangar bay to inform them of their new assignment. He found Echo and Fives in the process of unloading supplies from a gunship and conferred with the new recruits, discovering that given their lengthy service since joining the 501st, they had expected that Cody would have already made them Advanced Recon Commandos. Partly as a rebuke for their restlessness, Rex told them they would earn such a promotion when they no longer had to ask for it.\n\nAfter transferring to an Acclamator-class transport, the Jedi and the 501st landed at the Military Complex of Kamino's capital, Tipoca City, where Rex, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody met with Jedi General Shaak Ti and Prime Minister Lama Su to relay the news of the Separatists' plan. Though they quickly marshaled Kamino's defenses, it was not long before Grievous's fleet arrived to challenge the Republic's orbital blockade. While Skywalker and Admiral Yularen oversaw the space battle against Grievous's flotilla, Rex joined Cody, Kenobi, Ti, and Su in Tipoca City's command center to monitor their progress. However, as debris from the Separatist cruisers fell into Kamino's ocean, the space engagement proved to be a diversionary assault when the remains of the ships turned out to be disguised modules for Trident-class assault ships, which the Separatists secretly reassembled below sea level. Using the craft, Grievous and Ventress landed hundreds of droid troops in Tipoca City and rapidly beleaguered the vital cloning facilities. As the droids began to overrun the Military Complex, Rex and the others were joined by Skywalker, who returned to the war room to help organize the city's fortifications. Rex and his comrades agreed that the Separatists' primary target would be the DNA archive\u2014which was crucial for future clone production, as it stored the limited remainder of Jango Fett's DNA.\n\nWhile Skywalker and Kenobi headed off to guard the DNA archive chamber and oversee the main assault on the battle droids, respectively, Rex and Cody found Echo, Fives, and the maintenance clone 99 at the barracks with several young clone cadets, who had been separated from their group. Although the cadets did not believe they could be of help since they had not yet graduated from training, Fives and Echo rallied them to take up arms, underlining that it was their home that they were defending. With the droids nearing the barracks, Rex and Cody followed 99 to the nearby armory to retrieve weapons for the others so that they could stage a retaliatory assault. The cadets hid in the raised retractable sleeping chambers to provide extra firepower at the right moment. When a squad of B1 battle droids led by Grievous broke into the barracks, Rex, Cody, Echo, and Fives immediately gunned down the advance forces at the entrance, while Kenobi engaged Grievous in a lightsaber duel. However, Rex and his comrades could not eliminate all of the droids and retreated into the barracks, stampeding back along the main corridor with the droids in close pursuit. Rex quickly found cover behind several crates alongside Cody, Fives, and Echo to return the enemy fire. As the droids gained ground and pushed Echo, Fives, and Cody back toward Rex's position, 99 tossed Rex a thermal detonator, which he launched at the advancing droids. Yet he missed, instead hitting an adjacent crate.\n\nOnce the battle droids had passed by the cadets' hiding places, Rex commed the young trainees to open fire on the droids, which they did to great effect. As more droids fell in the ensuing crossfire, Cody used up the last of the thermal detonators. Though 99 opted to retrieve another supply of explosives from the armory, his decision to abandon his cover\u2014despite protest from Rex and the others\u2014cost him his life, as he took enemy fire to the back and died. Cody thereafter received word from Ti that the droids had been pushed back to the main hangar. The Republic forces soon secured a victory over the remaining Separatist forces, forcing Grievous and Ventress to retreat. However, the damage had been done: Rex, Cody, Fives, and Echo took some time to lament the loss of 99, whom they believed had been a true soldier in spite of his debilitative cloning malformations. While clone troopers and Kaminoan cloners alike began to repair the desolation wrought throughout Tipoca City, Rex and Cody found Fives and Echo in the Military Complex's hangar and commended them on the true valor they had displayed during the battle. Once again impressed with their efforts, Rex and Cody officially promoted both 501st troopers\u2014who had been only cadets not that long ago\u2014to the prestigious rank of Advanced Recon Commando, saluting the Grand Army's newest ARC troopers.\n\nLater in the war, the Trade Federation blockaded Pantora, suspending all commerce with the system to pressure the Pantorans into an alliance with the Confederacy. While with Skywalker on Coruscant, Rex was with him and Padm\u00e9 Amidala on a landing pad as the latter was preparing to leave the capital aboard her J-type diplomatic barge. The three of them soon received news from Tano that Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe\u2014the daughters of Chi Cho's successor, Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida\u2014had been kidnapped. Skywalker sent his Padawan to aid Riyo Chuchi in investigating the matter, and Tano and Chuchi helped Papanoida rescue his daughters from the Separatists. They restored relations between Pantora and the Trade Federation, repealing the blockade.\n\nWhile on their way to rendezvous with Jedi General Kit Fisto, Rex and Skywalker made a brief stop on Mandalore. The reason for their visit was to drop off Tano, whom the Jedi High Council had delegated\u2014at the request of Satine Kryze\u2014to teach cadet classes at the Royal Academy of Government. Because the world had become engulfed in a black market crisis, Tano's involvement was intended to curb the planet's deeply rooted corruption among its future leaders. After arriving at the Sundari docks aboard an Eta-class shuttle, Rex and another trooper stood by while Kryze and her Prime Minister, Almec, welcomed Skywalker and Tano. With Fisto expecting them, Rex reminded Skywalker of their orders, and they soon left Mandalore to join up with Fisto. Meanwhile, Tano and her students found that Almec was behind the ongoing black market conspiracy and helped Kryze bring him to justice.\n\nShortly after returning to Coruscant, Skywalker was given command of the Third Legion for another assignment. A large-scale civil war had consumed the planet Balith, and in response to an appeal for Republic aid, the Jedi Council tasked Skywalker with intervening in the fighting. While Tano stayed at the Jedi Temple to focus on her studies, Rex and troops from Torrent Company were with Skywalker on a Nu-class attack shuttle, and then boarded a Venator-class Star Destroyer for the voyage to Balith.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The fearless Force-sensitive\n\nTano was a confident and moralistic person, and a firm defender of the innocent. This carried on even after she left the Order, as she joined Bail Organa's rebellion to restore liberty and democracy to the people oppressed by the Empire. Tano also felt pity and compassion for the Inquisitor known as the Sixth Brother despite slaying him in combat. She regarded the Sixth Brother as a victim whose potential for good had been twisted and turned to the dark side. After befriending the Force-sensitive Hedala Fardi, Tano became concerned with protecting Force-sensitive children from being captured by the Empire's Inquisitors. During her time with the Martez sisters shortly before the end of the war, they noted that she still acted like a Jedi even though she was no longer a member of the order.\n\nDuring her time running from the Empire, Tano continued to suffer from grief over the loss of her friends and guilt over the fact that she wasn't there to help them. During her time on Raada, Tano was unsure about making new friends, largely due to the emotional pain inflicted by Offee's betrayal. Despite everything Offee had done, Tano believed that while she was wrong about \"a lot of things,\" she did have a point about the Jedi and the Republic, and later expressed her belief that if had they truly listened to her, they might have been able to stop Darth Sidious before it was too late. When Tano began to help people hurt by the Empire, she felt better about herself and as though she was fulfilling her training to do justice, feeling even better because her work was hurting the Empire that hurt her. She felt as though she had been a hero in her past and was one again, although she knew she needed to try to avoid tapping into her reckless nature. She decided to find a middle path to life when she became a rebel, not becoming a Jedi again but also not allowing her heart to harden when faced with the death of friends.\n\nIn addition to knowing friends would die in war, she knew it could change people, having spent her life as a Padawan fighting as a soldier instead of working as a peace keeper. Thus, she came to hate warfare, with her distaste for it making her notice that the fourteen year old Miara Larte had altered her behavior to avoid the Empire's patrols. In fact, she believed that, just because she had started to fight in the Clone Wars at that age, it was not a good example for Larte. Even as Imperial forces closed in, she found that meditation was easy for her, yet she also recognized she had nothing to say to the Empire's troops on Raada, not even using banter or taunts. Upon meeting Senator Organa for the second time, she noticed when he said his daughter took after her mother, yet she failed to answer the test she suspected the words were; Leia was secretly the daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, but Tano elected to move past the subject, knowing Organa and her would need to trust each other despite each other's secrets.\n\nAs a rebel Informant code-named \"Fulcrum,\" Tano worked indirectly with various rebel cells, always with her face hidden and her voice disguised, and became somewhat pragmatic as she advised Hera Syndulla to cease searching for Kanan Jarrus to protect her crew, especially Ezra Bridger. This may suggest she developed a more discreet nature and decided overall to put the many before the few. When Tano was saved and reunited with Bridger in the World Between Worlds, she was saddened to learn of the fate of Jarrus, but disturbed by Bridger's idea of saving Jarrus from dying. Drawing from her own experience of being unable to save her master, Tano successfully convinced Bridger to let Jarrus go, and they parted ways, promising to find each other again as Tano went back to Malachor and resumed her journey.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Tano sought to keep her promise to Bridger and joined his former companion Sabine Wren in her quest to find him and bring him home. At that time, she had adopted a more stoic persona. However, after the Force spirit of Skywalker gave her a final lesson and her decision to live, her personality returned to a more lively state.",

        "content": "# Rex - Infiltration of the Citadel[]\n\nFollowing the Confederacy's capture of Jedi Master Even Piell, the Jedi Order sanctioned a mission to free the senior High Council member from incarceration in the Citadel, the most feared prison installation in the galaxy. Because Piell had just discovered the coordinates of the strategic Nexus Route, a secret hyperspace lane that spanned from Coruscant to the heart of Separatist space, his findings were of great value to both sides of the war. Rex was assigned to Skywalker and Kenobi's elite team to rescue Piell alongside Cody, Fives, Echo, and several other clone troopers. When Plo Koon headed a briefing on the mission at the Jedi Temple's communication center, Rex was present at the conference via hologram. The task ahead would become one of Rex's most difficult ones since the outset of the war: Because the Citadel had originally been designed to hold rogue Jedi who had fallen to the dark side of the Force, no team had ever been able to infiltrate the highly guarded prison. Although Rex was skeptical that the Separatists were still keeping Piell alive, the Jedi firmly believed that the Separatists would not kill Piell until they had extracted the Nexus Route coordinates, which were too valuable to waste. Once the Jedi had established a plan for infiltrating the Citadel on the planet Lola Sayu, Rex joined the others at a carbon-freezing chamber in the Jedi Temple Hangar, where they were to be encased in carbonite to circumvent the Citadel's life-form scanners.\n\nAfter the Republic engineer Erk Zallis froze them in carbonite, Rex and his comrades were ushered onto Shuttle 81572, a captured Separatist Class Type B escort shuttle, which R2-D2 and a squad of reprogrammed B1 battle droids would pilot to Lola Sayu. R2-D2's battle droids transported the infiltration team\u2014including the unauthorized addition of Ahsoka Tano\u2014to Lola Sayu, gaining clearance from Citadel Command to proceed to the prison. At a site amidst the Citadel's maintenance pipes, Rex and the others were unfrozen from the carbonite, taking some time to recover from the encasement process before heading out for the facility. In the meantime, R2-D2 and his battle droids remained behind to guard the shuttle. Separated from the cliff-side entry point to the Citadel by a river of sulfurous lava, the squad was forced to ascend the cliff to the lookout balcony. However, strong winds hampered the use of jetpacks, and sensitive electro-mines thwarted ascension cables, so the Jedi and clones resolved to free-climb the cliff. Rex and his companions braved the dangerous conditions and reached the lookout balcony, where Tano disabled the door's ray shield from the inside by slipping through a ventilation shaft.\n\nJust as Rex, Cody, and their men were joining Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi on the balcony, trooper Charger lost his footing and fell down the cliff, activating an electro-mine and consequently being shocked to death. With alarms blaring and the Citadel's warden, Osi Sobeck, alerted to the Republic team's presence due to the tripped electro-mine, the Jedi and clones crept into the prison on the lookout for battle droid patrols. Avoiding droid guards and eliminating surveillance cameras along one of the hallways, the team cut through laser emplacements lining the walls. However, they soon discovered that the hallway was electrified when Sobeck remotely activated that trap. The others reached a safe passageway, but trooper Longshot was killed before he could make it to safety. After locating and breaking into Piell's holding cell with his comrades, Rex gunned down the A4 laboratory assistant droid that had been on the verge of gouging out Piell's sole remaining eye. Once Skywalker and Kenobi had freed him from his containment field, Piell revealed that he only possessed half of the Nexus Routes coordinates\u2014the rest laid with his Republic Navy captain, Wilhuff Tarkin, who had committed them to memory and would also require rescuing, along with the clone trooper crew captured from Piell's flagship.",

        "content": "# Rex - Wartime assignments[]\n\nWhen a group of clone troopers, having just pilfered the coordinates for the Separatist hypermatter generators, crashed on the Hutt Space world Asuin, Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi were tasked with rescuing the clone squad before the Confederacy could recover the intelligence. After Rex pinpointed the location of the squad's escape pod on the surface via scanning, Skywalker and Kenobi moved in to secure the craft. While battling the Separatists, Rex made contact with his Jedi Generals and reported that battle droid reinforcements led by Asajj Ventress were heading for their position. Skywalker and Kenobi managed to rescue the sole surviving trooper of the crash, but Ventress then confronted them. Although she destroyed J-3PO, the protocol droid containing the hypermatter generator coordinates, Skywalker and Kenobi were able to escape from the battlefield.\n\nShortly after the planet Makem Te rejoined the Republic, the Separatists deployed an advanced tank known as the Bogg Behemoth on the world. The Jedi Council dispatched Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi to combat the new threat. Taking a battle group of HAVw A6 Juggernaut tanks and a clone legion to Makem Te, Rex and his Jedi Generals found the Bogg Behemoth in the desert near the city Thousand Thousand. Even with commandos supporting their elite detachment, Rex voiced skepticism to Skywalker and Kenobi that they would be able to capture the Bogg Behemoth, as they had been ordered to do. Because intelligence alleged that the Bogg Behemoth was still undergoing final testing, Kenobi mobilized their forces in a preliminary strike before the tank came online. When Rex led his men against the Bogg Behemoth, their intelligence proved to be faulty\u2014the tank, already functional, began to launch scores of missiles at the clone soldiers.\n\nThough Rex had the Republic's AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons return fire at the Bogg Behemoth, the tank's shield and heavy armor afforded it sufficient protection to endure the thick bombardment. With their men taking losses, Skywalker and Kenobi elected to instead assault the Bogg Behemoth from above. Rex and the Jedi landed their troopers on the tank via LAAT/i gunships, but hundreds of DSD1 dwarf spider droids confronted them before they could secure the deck. As Rex and his soldiers held out against the dwarf spider droids, Skywalker and Kenobi infiltrated the tank and forced its Geonosian operator, Bogg, to deactivate the vehicle and its defenses. Despite the clones' capture of the Bogg Behemoth, Kenobi chose to destroy it, as he simply did not believe that the Republic could adapt such destructive weapons for proper ethical use.\n\nOn another occasion, Rex joined Kenobi, Cody, and a company from the 212th Attack Battalion to claim Bogoa, a world whose durable coral was coveted by the Confederacy for use as ship-building material. After battling the Separatists for three days, the Republic forces managed to compromise the enemy stranglehold. During the following interlude in fighting, Rex remained at the Republic's staging area with Kenobi and the 212th infantry while Cody embarked on roundup duty, searching for survivors amidst the carnage on the battlefield. Cody soon found the B1 battle droid Coppertop, whose battle protocols had been peculiarly overridden; the droid had subsequently deserted the Separatist Droid Army to aid the wounded from both sides of the conflict. When Asajj Ventress and the bounty hunter Cyreltov attempted to reclaim Coppertop for Count Dooku, who had issued the experimental Order 99 directive that had modified Coppertop's objectives, Coppertop sacrificed himself to prevent Kenobi and Ventress from fighting over him. Ventress and Cyreltov thereafter retreated from Bogoa, having failed to retrieve Coppertop, while Kenobi and the clone troopers recovered from the battle.",

        "content": "# Rex - Infiltration of the Citadel[]\n\nEn route to free Tarkin and the other officers, Rex and his comrades were intercepted and surrounded from both directions by a squad of the Citadel's elite BX-series droid commandos. Though Rex assisted Skywalker and Tano in eliminating the droids at their end, the entire team fell prey to the powerfully magnetized ceiling, which pilfered their weapons and held them out of reach some meters above them. As Kenobi, Tano, and Piell used the Force to hold droid commando reinforcements at bay, Skywalker, who had been pulled up to the ceiling because of his prosthetic hand, managed to reclaim his lightsaber and sliced through the magnet. Rex and his comrades quickly rearmed themselves and cut through the droids. Before continuing on with the others, Rex disabled the surveillance cameras in the area, through which Sobeck had been watching them. Once Tarkin and the clone officers had been liberated from their cell, the Jedi decided on a new plan to escape from the Citadel: While Kenobi and Piell took one group to create a diversion, another team led by Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Tarkin would find an escape route from the fortress. An advantage of such a tactic was that Piell's and Tarkin's halves of the Nexus Route intelligence would remain separated should Sobeck recapture one of them.\n\nUsing dated data from the Jedi Archives, Skywalker located a hallway adjacent to one of the Citadel's original fortress tunnels. He cut a hole through the wall with his lightsaber, and Rex and the others entered the tunnels, with Rex having Fives and Echo replace the severed hole behind them to avoid detection by Sobeck's pursuant forces. As they headed for the entrance to a pipeline network, Skywalker took up position at the rear to guard their flank from the droids sent to recapture them, while Tano led the group onward. Along the way, Rex defended Tano's abilities from Tarkin, who doubted that the young Padawan was capable of leading them to safety. After they found themselves at a dead end in the caverns, B2 super battle droids and droid commandos caught up with them, with the commandos sporting personal energy shields to counter the clone troopers' blasters. While Rex, Skywalker, and their soldiers faced down the droids, Tano used thermal detonators that Rex had been carrying in a supply backpack to rupture the obstructive wall, saving two of the explosives to use on the shield-wielding droid commandos. Both the wall and the droids were blasted apart, allowing Rex and his comrades to travel on toward the pipeline.\n\nRex and the others entered the large fuel line to ascend a ridge; they were to meet R2-D2 and their escape shuttle at the cliff's zenith. Due to the risk of igniting the flammable fuel within the pipe, Rex and the other troopers deactivated their lights and locked their weapons during their climb. Upon exiting the fuel line at the top of the cliff, Rex and his comrades were faced with a squad of B1 battle droids and LM-432 crab droids. While Skywalker and Tano deflected the battle droids' fire, Rex and Tarkin headed for cover with their men behind a series of nearby hills. After joining them, Skywalker used a thermal detonator from Rex to explode the section of the fuel line that they had just exited, leaving the droids in pieces. As Kenobi and the shuttle had not yet reached the pipeline, Rex and the others resorted to their backup plan\u2014meeting Kenobi at his position instead. Rex helped one of Piell's injured clone officers to the Citadel's rear landing platform, where Kenobi, Piell, and their soldiers were battling Sobeck's forces to reclaim their shuttle, from which the droids had separated them. Rex, Skywalker, Tano, Tarkin, and their group joined Kenobi's squad at their cover behind several crates, but their refuge was compromised with the arrival of battle droids aboard STAPs, which soared in to attack them from behind.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Visiting Ossus\n\nFollowing the rescue of Grogu, Tano met the son of her former master Anakin, Luke Skywalker, who was also the current owner of her friend R2-D2. Shortly before the Battle of Mos Espa, Tano joined Skywalker and Grogu on the planet Ossus, where Skywalker was building a new Jedi temple to train a new generation of Jedi. She observed that Grogu missed his former warden Djarin a great deal, which she believed could complicate his Jedi training. During her time on Ossus, Djarin himself visited the temple with the intention of reuniting with Grogu and gifting him Mandalorian chain mail. The Mandalorian bounty hunter was ignored for sometime until R2-D2 led Tano to him to deal with his desire to see Grogu. While Djarin was surprised to see Tano on Ossus, she took the time to explain how the building would become \"a great school,\" with Grogu its first student, and promised the youngling was doing fine. When Djarin insisted on seeing him, Tano invited Djarin to accompany her on a walk through the bamboo forest and reminded him of her warning about how his attachment to Grogu would be difficult to let go off.\n\nJust as she respected Skywalker's decision to train Grogu, Tano agreed to respect Djarin's wish to see the child he had kept in his care for so long, motioning to a hill where Skywalker was seated with Grogu. She did, however, ask him to consider if he was doing it for Grogu or just himself, pondering if the armor was a way for the former foundling\u2014who was possibly a Padawan by that point, by Tano's reckoning\u2014to remember his father figure. While Djarin declared that the armor would protect Grogu no matter what path he chose, Tano offered to deliver it in his stead, believing that a reunion between Djarin and Grogu would only make his training more difficult. Djarin acquiesced to Ahsoka's offer and handed her the beskar armor, asking her to ensure Grogu would be protected.\n\nTano then joined Luke in watching one of Grogu's training exercises. She was impressed with both the child's progress and Skywalker's teaching skills. Skywalker replied that it was more like Grogu was remembering his previous lessons, to which Tano observed the student sometimes guided their master. Skywalker then revealed he knew the Mandalorian had been present, to which she revealed the gift he had dropped off. When Skywalker wondered whether Grogu was committed to being a Jedi, Tano told Luke he was just like his father and counseled him to trust his instincts. Tano then moved to leave to resume her search for Thrawn, promising Skywalker there was a chance they would meet again and bidding the Force be with him. In the end, Grogu would decide to return to Djarin and take on the life of a Mandalorian. At one point, Tano traveled to Black Spire Outpost on the world of Batuu, a city Thrawn and her master Anakin Skywalker had visited in the past.\n\n",

He found Echo and Fives in the process of unloading supplies from a gunship and conferred with the new recruits, discovering that given their lengthy service since joining the 501st, they had expected that Cody would have already made them Advanced Recon Commandos. Partly as a rebuke for their restlessness, Rex told them they would earn such a promotion when they no longer had to ask for it.\n\nAfter transferring to an Acclamator-class transport, the Jedi and the 501st landed at the Military Complex of Kamino's capital, Tipoca City, where Rex, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody met with Jedi General Shaak Ti and Prime Minister Lama Su to relay the news of the Separatists' plan. Though they quickly marshaled Kamino's defenses, it was not long before Grievous's fleet arrived to challenge the Republic's orbital blockade. While Skywalker and Admiral Yularen oversaw the space battle against Grievous's flotilla, Rex joined Cody, Kenobi, Ti, and Su in Tipoca City's command center to monitor their progress. However, as debris from the Separatist cruisers fell into Kamino's ocean, the space engagement proved to be a diversionary assault when the remains of the ships turned out to be disguised modules for Trident-class assault ships, which the Separatists secretly reassembled below sea level. Using the craft, Grievous and Ventress landed hundreds of droid troops in Tipoca City and rapidly beleaguered the vital cloning facilities. As the droids began to overrun the Military Complex, Rex and the others were joined by Skywalker, who returned to the war room to help organize the city's fortifications. Rex and his comrades agreed that the Separatists' primary target would be the DNA archive\u2014which was crucial for future clone production, as it stored the limited remainder of Jango Fett's DNA.\n\nWhile Skywalker and Kenobi headed off to guard the DNA archive chamber and oversee the main assault on the battle droids, respectively, Rex and Cody found Echo, Fives, and the maintenance clone 99 at the barracks with several young clone cadets, who had been separated from their group. Although the cadets did not believe they could be of help since they had not yet graduated from training, Fives and Echo rallied them to take up arms, underlining that it was their home that they were defending. With the droids nearing the barracks, Rex and Cody followed 99 to the nearby armory to retrieve weapons for the others so that they could stage a retaliatory assault. The cadets hid in the raised retractable sleeping chambers to provide extra firepower at the right moment. When a squad of B1 battle droids led by Grievous broke into the barracks, Rex, Cody, Echo, and Fives immediately gunned down the advance forces at the entrance, while Kenobi engaged Grievous in a lightsaber duel. However, Rex and his comrades could not eliminate all of the droids and retreated into the barracks, stampeding back along the main corridor with the droids in close pursuit. Rex quickly found cover behind several crates alongside Cody, Fives, and Echo to return the enemy fire. As the droids gained ground and pushed Echo, Fives, and Cody back toward Rex's position, 99 tossed Rex a thermal detonator, which he launched at the advancing droids. Yet he missed, instead hitting an adjacent crate.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Searching for Grand Admiral Thrawn\n\nConcerned about Thrawn's possible return, Tano interrogated Morgan Elsbeth for any information regarding Thrawn, his intentions, and how to find him. Elsbeth ended up revealing the location of a map to the alleged location of Thrawn in the galaxy of Peridea. Elsbeth was delivered to New Republic custody after her capture as well.\n\nTano soon began searching the ruins of an ancient stronghold on Arcana. She soon approached a runic circle in the middle of the stony courtyard and used her twin lightsabers to cut a hole below her feet, allowing her to access to the chamber underneath. Tano gazed at several cloaked figures carved onto the wall, before walking over to a pillar, and using Psychometry on it. Sensing that it was the key to retrieving the map, the former Jedi rotated a part of it, before then rotating the tip of it, which caused an orb next to one of the carvings to glow. Tano smirked, before moving over to a second pillar. After rotating a part of the second pillar, she watched an orb in the heart of one of the other carved figures to glow. She then rotated a part of a third pillar, causing a third orb to glow, and an altar with a rectangular stony object to rise from the floor. Tano touched the stony box, which had crumbled and revealed a golden orb. She had informed Professor Huyang that she had found the object via comlink, but his transmissions had been jammed.\n\nTano soon returned to the surface where she was confronted by a red HK assassin droid, who had demanded the map. She had found herself surrounded by five assassin droids wielding electrostaffs. Tano had drawn her twin lightsabers in defense. Tano had jumped back into the hole she had created and had used her lightsaber to cut holes between three of the droids. Tano then fought the other two and had cut across the torso with her lightsaber. She had beheaded the fifth droid. As two droids had emerged from their holes, the lead droid had issued orders to initiate their self-destruct protocols. The other two droids had complied, and Tano had been forced to flee. While running, she had contacted Huyang, who had told her that their T-6 Jedi shuttle was above her position. She had told him to drop his ramp at a distance outside the ruins. The two had escaped before they could be killed by the fiery inferno that had swept through the ruins.\n\nInside the cockpit, Tano had conversed with Huyang about their communication difficulty. He had told her that he had kept her ship at a safe distance in accordance with Jedi mission protocol. She had replied that the Jedi Order didn't exist anymore. When Huyang had said he had his programming, she had advised him to stick close and watch her back. Huyang had replied that it was the job of a Jedi Padawan learner, which he was not. Tano had told Huyang that he had found the map based on Elsbeth's information. When Huyang had asked how she had gotten Elsbeth to tell the truth, Tano had replied that she hadn't been following Jedi protocol.\n\nNot long afterwards, they received an incoming transmission from New Republic Fleet Command, who told Tano and Huyang about the recent attack from Baylan Skoll and his apprentice Shin Hati to rescue Morgan Elsbeth. Tano and Huyang then traveled to Home One via hyperspace. Tano identified their ship as T-6 1974, and Fleet Command cleared them to land at hangar 2-9. Inside the hangar, General Hera Syndulla greeted them and informed them about the loss of Elsbeth.\n\nSyndulla had prepared a briefing for Tano to catch up. In the briefing, Syndulla told Tano and Huyang about the damage the two mercenaries had done, taking out an entire security detail and scuttling a new starship. Tano was unfamiliar with the attackers, who had demonstrated Force powers similar to the Jedi. Huyang suggested that one of these intruders had once been a Jedi. Tano told Huyang to scan Skoll's and Shin\u2019s lightsabers.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Lightsaber abilities\n\nAhsoka Tano made use of an unorthodox reverse grip during combat, but, at the insistence of her master, eventually began to utilize the standard grip in addition to her reverse grip. Tano was a particularly acrobatic lightsaber duelist who often utilized the Force to jump down on her opponents and to dodge lightsaber strikes. Although she was physically smaller than many of her foes, she proved to be a skilled duelist, wielding one and eventually two lightsabers.\n\nAt the beginning of her apprenticeship under Skywalker, Tano's combat skills were already quite considerable given that she defeated three IG-100 MagnaGuards single-handedly during her first mission. Later, Tano temporarily held her ground against the skilled Sith assassin Asajj Ventress and the Jedi hunter General Grievous after only a very short time training under Skywalker, although she was forced to run away from Grievous a short time into their confrontation. Her skills in lightsaber combat developed over time, and she began to favor using a variant of Form V in battle like her master, although Offee was certain she would be skilled at Form VI as well.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Tano became a practitioner of Jar'Kai, wielding a yellowish-green shoto lightsaber in addition to her standard lightsaber. However, Tano occasionally utilized only her main lightsaber, such as when she dueled Skywalker on Mortis while under the dark side influence of the Son. Nevertheless, Tano more commonly utilized Jar'Kai, particularly when facing multiple opponents such as when she engaged the much more experienced Skywalker and Kenobi on Mortis. Whilst fleeing from clones after being framed for murder, Tano lost her second lightsaber and was forced to use only her main lightsaber to fight Barriss Offee. Her duel against Offee showed that she had become too reliant on her second lightsaber, something she had in common with Asajj Ventress, and though she did put up a considerable fight, Offee overwhelmed her.\n\nAround two years after her first duel with Grievous, Tano proved during their encounter on Florrum that her skills in lightsaber combat had improved vastly as she held her own against all four of Grievous's lightsabers, whereas previously she only lasted a short time when he was using only two lightsabers. Instead of fleeing after exchanging only a few blows, Tano held her ground and gave the Younglings time to escape before escaping with them. By the time of the Siege of Mandalore, Tano demonstrated highly advanced skills in lightsaber combat as evidenced by her prolonged duel with the powerful former Sith Lord Maul. Although Maul successfully disarmed Tano at the conclusion of their duel, she turned Maul's own attack against him in order to defeat him nonetheless.\n\nThroughout the Clone War, Tano showed adeptness with deflecting blaster shots, particularly during Order 66, where she survived in a prolonged battle against her own men. Even in extremely close-quarter fighting, she was able to defend herself despite being surrounded by multiple troopers. Thanks to her training, she knew she could fight while blinded, yet she recognized needing to do that and fight without lightsabers would be a challenge. She was also skilled enough to fight without lightsabers, defeating the Sixth Brother, who was wielding a lightsaber, with only the Force.\n\nSixteen years after her departure from the Jedi Order, Tano's skill in lightsaber combat had greatly improved to the point of mastery. During a skirmish at Hammertown, she easily defeated two Imperial Inquisitors at once and even deactivated the double-bladed lightsaber of the Seventh Sister with her bare hands. During the mission to Malachor, Tano again proved capable of fighting several Inquisitors at once and even disarmed the Fifth Brother and destroyed his lightsaber. During the same mission, Tano again proved capable of dueling to a stalemate with the former Sith Lord Maul before breaking off the fight to rescue Ezra Bridger. Shortly afterward, Tano engaged in an intense duel with Darth Vader, and although she ultimately lost, she proved capable of putting up a much more impressive fight against him than either Jarrus or Bridger were previously able to.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The fearless Force-sensitive\n\nAhsoka Tano was a Togruta female who had blue eyes, dark orange skin, brownish-grey lips, white facial markings, a slender build, and white lekku and montrals with blue stripes. The markings on her montrals were unique, and her montrals continued to grow as she matured. During her early childhood, Tano's trust in others was negatively impacted by a Jedi imposter who tried to enslave her, and the memory of the scorn her fellow villagers felt towards her remained with her until her trip to Ilum; upon trusting Master Yoda, she felt that trust came easier to her because she was again trusting her own instincts. The teachings and values of the Jedi Order became sacred to her, and she always sought to protect the lives of innocents.\n\nAs a teenager, Tano was snarky, cocky, stubborn, reckless, and impulsive, yet also brave, loyal, generous, and kind-hearted. The young Tano's emotions made her a perfect apprentice for Anakin Skywalker, with Grand Master Yoda himself recognizing that the two became \"twice the trouble\" after being paired together. She was very feisty and snippy, earning her the nickname \"Snips\" from her master. Like her master, she could at times become aggressive and willing to use terror or threats to get the answers she wanted. She had a tendency to follow her heart, which negatively impacted her path to Jedi knighthood. In her younger years, Tano's emotions inhibited her ability to make wise decisions, although she eventually gained the confidence to make the right ones, despite the great cost to her feelings. Beyond learning from both Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the teachings of Qui-Gon Jinn were indirectly passed down to Tano.\n\nOver time, Tano became more mature and enlightened, with her experiences during the Clone Wars shaping her into someone who could control her emotions. She had her victories, her failures, and her losses yet strove through them all, as she felt it was her duty as a Jedi to help restore peace and prosperity to the Republic. Her constant travels and experiences made her more worldly than most people her age, and often she was surprised by the various events and people she came across during the Clone Wars. Throughout her time as a Jedi, she remained close with Plo Koon, who had brought her to the Jedi Temple, and saw him as an important mentor in her life. She also developed a friendships with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his second-in-command, Cody, as well as Senator Amidala through her master, Anakin Skywalker.\n\nShe respected Yoda despite often not understanding his advice, feeling he was almost always correct. However, when Tano was framed for murder and treason, she was horrified when the Jedi Order cast her out and all but condemned her to a Republic military tribunal, and came very close to being sentenced to death. When Skywalker unveiled the true culprit, Tano was shocked to see it was her friend Barriss Offee. Though conflicted, she ultimately rejected the opportunity to become a Jedi again, having lost faith in the Order for not standing by her.\n\nTano formed a strong bond with the clones, especially Captain Rex, and throughout her time as serving as their commander had learned a lot from them. She respected the clones as individuals and got along with them very well. Tano quickly began to enjoy their company, telling war stories with them as soon as she had any experience to speak on. When Tano found herself serving with the clones of the 501st again at the Siege of Mandalore, the clones continued to salute her out of respect and even repainted their helmets in her likeness to show how much she meant to them. When Order 66 turned the friends she had served with for years into enemies, Tano stood by her beliefs and told Rex to not kill them, determined to escape without directly killing her former comrades. When the ship crashed into the moon, Tano returned to the crash site to dig graves for each clone.",

        "content": "# Rex - Bloodshed and rescues[]\n\nWhen the Resolute was scheduled to undergo a refit, Rex and Torrent Company were transferred with Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, and Yularen to the recently christened Star Destroyer Indomitable. Presently, the Jedi and their fleet\u2014including the cruisers Indomitable, Pioneer, and Coruscant Sky\u2014received intelligence from the Grand Army's Special Operations Brigade that General Grievous was planning on seizing Kothlis and its Bothan Spynet facility. While in Indomitable's mess hall, Rex, Sergeant Coric, and trooper Checkers were joined by Tano, who reported that the fleet was heading to mount a defense of Kothlis. Rex learned from Tano that a ground assault on the planet was highly possible; if the Separatists had already begun to invade Kothlis, Kenobi and Tano would be leading the counterattack on the surface while Skywalker commanded the space battle. The captain then put his men on standby and had them begin preparations for the imminent battle. When Indomitable, Pioneer, and Coruscant Sky arrived at Kothlis, they found that Grievous had already begun to beleaguer the undefended planet. The Jedi additionally discovered that Grievous was employing a computer virus to jam all of the Republic's comm channels, terminating ship-to-ship communications.\n\nSkywalker met with Rex, Tano, and their waiting men in their barracks and informed them of the Separatists' comm jammer. Although Rex was concerned with the news, Skywalker stated it was possible that comms would be restored in time; if necessary, reinforcements could be requested. Before proceeding to the gunship hangar with Tano and Torrent Company, Rex wished his general good hunting. Once Skywalker and his Gold Squadron pilots had initiated the space battle against Grievous, Rex and Tano were joined by Kenobi in their gunship and led the assault force's launch from the fleet. En route to the surface of Kothlis, Rex spared his men a few last-minute words for preparation. After landing, Kenobi ordered Rex and Tano into the fray while he led the assault on the Separatist-claimed Spynet facility. Rex, Tano, and Torrent Company engaged the entrenched droid infantry forces in the central plaza of Kothlis's capital, Tal'cara, battling super battle droids, droidekas, and STAP-mounted droids. However, with only one gunship for air support, Torrent Company took heavy losses\u2014their highest since the Battle of Teth.\n\nRex was among the injured, taking wounds to his right arm and chest. Checkers, who was wounded less severely, stood with his captain, ready to support him if he needed it. After the fight against the droids in the plaza reached a temporary standstill, Tano ordered Rex and his men to fall back and tried to contact Yularen for assistance, but her attempt failed due to the Separatists' still-active comm jammer. Seeing no other options, she left to get help from Kenobi while the barely conscious Rex stayed to watch over his men. Tano rendezvoused with Kenobi and assisted him in reclaiming the Spynet facility from the Confederacy, thanks in part to the efforts\u2014and sacrifices\u2014of Torrent Company and other clone units. The Republic fleet also managed to repel Grievous's forces from Kothlis. Rex, Coric, and the other wounded soldiers were sent for treatment at the Republic's Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, one of the Republic Sector Armies' twenty Haven-class medical stations. Tano chose to be treated with them at the Outer Rim medcenter so that she could provide moral support.",

        "content": "# Rex - Infiltration of the Citadel[]\n\nFollowing the Confederacy's capture of Jedi Master Even Piell, the Jedi Order sanctioned a mission to free the senior High Council member from incarceration in the Citadel, the most feared prison installation in the galaxy. Because Piell had just discovered the coordinates of the strategic Nexus Route, a secret hyperspace lane that spanned from Coruscant to the heart of Separatist space, his findings were of great value to both sides of the war. Rex was assigned to Skywalker and Kenobi's elite team to rescue Piell alongside Cody, Fives, Echo, and several other clone troopers. When Plo Koon headed a briefing on the mission at the Jedi Temple's communication center, Rex was present at the conference via hologram. The task ahead would become one of Rex's most difficult ones since the outset of the war: Because the Citadel had originally been designed to hold rogue Jedi who had fallen to the dark side of the Force, no team had ever been able to infiltrate the highly guarded prison. Although Rex was skeptical that the Separatists were still keeping Piell alive, the Jedi firmly believed that the Separatists would not kill Piell until they had extracted the Nexus Route coordinates, which were too valuable to waste. Once the Jedi had established a plan for infiltrating the Citadel on the planet Lola Sayu, Rex joined the others at a carbon-freezing chamber in the Jedi Temple Hangar, where they were to be encased in carbonite to circumvent the Citadel's life-form scanners.\n\nAfter the Republic engineer Erk Zallis froze them in carbonite, Rex and his comrades were ushered onto Shuttle 81572, a captured Separatist Class Type B escort shuttle, which R2-D2 and a squad of reprogrammed B1 battle droids would pilot to Lola Sayu. R2-D2's battle droids transported the infiltration team\u2014including the unauthorized addition of Ahsoka Tano\u2014to Lola Sayu, gaining clearance from Citadel Command to proceed to the prison. At a site amidst the Citadel's maintenance pipes, Rex and the others were unfrozen from the carbonite, taking some time to recover from the encasement process before heading out for the facility. In the meantime, R2-D2 and his battle droids remained behind to guard the shuttle. Separated from the cliff-side entry point to the Citadel by a river of sulfurous lava, the squad was forced to ascend the cliff to the lookout balcony. However, strong winds hampered the use of jetpacks, and sensitive electro-mines thwarted ascension cables, so the Jedi and clones resolved to free-climb the cliff. Rex and his companions braved the dangerous conditions and reached the lookout balcony, where Tano disabled the door's ray shield from the inside by slipping through a ventilation shaft.\n\nJust as Rex, Cody, and their men were joining Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi on the balcony, trooper Charger lost his footing and fell down the cliff, activating an electro-mine and consequently being shocked to death. With alarms blaring and the Citadel's warden, Osi Sobeck, alerted to the Republic team's presence due to the tripped electro-mine, the Jedi and clones crept into the prison on the lookout for battle droid patrols. Avoiding droid guards and eliminating surveillance cameras along one of the hallways, the team cut through laser emplacements lining the walls. However, they soon discovered that the hallway was electrified when Sobeck remotely activated that trap. The others reached a safe passageway, but trooper Longshot was killed before he could make it to safety. After locating and breaking into Piell's holding cell with his comrades, Rex gunned down the A4 laboratory assistant droid that had been on the verge of gouging out Piell's sole remaining eye. Once Skywalker and Kenobi had freed him from his containment field, Piell revealed that he only possessed half of the Nexus Routes coordinates\u2014the rest laid with his Republic Navy captain, Wilhuff Tarkin, who had committed them to memory and would also require rescuing, along with the clone trooper crew captured from Piell's flagship.\n\nEn route to free Tarkin and the other officers, Rex and his comrades were intercepted and surrounded from both directions by a squad of the Citadel's elite BX-series droid commandos. Though Rex assisted Skywalker and Tano in eliminating the droids at their end, the entire team fell prey to the powerfully magnetized ceiling, which pilfered their weapons and held them out of reach some meters above them. As Kenobi, Tano, and Piell used the Force to hold droid commando reinforcements at bay, Skywalker, who had been pulled up to the ceiling because of his prosthetic hand, managed to reclaim his lightsaber and sliced through the magnet. Rex and his comrades quickly rearmed themselves and cut through the droids. Before continuing on with the others, Rex disabled the surveillance cameras in the area, through which Sobeck had been watching them. Once Tarkin and the clone officers had been liberated from their cell, the Jedi decided on a new plan to escape from the Citadel: While Kenobi and Piell took one group to create a diversion, another team led by Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Tarkin would find an escape route from the fortress. An advantage of such a tactic was that Piell's and Tarkin's halves of the Nexus Route intelligence would remain separated should Sobeck recapture one of them.\n\nUsing dated data from the Jedi Archives, Skywalker located a hallway adjacent to one of the Citadel's original fortress tunnels. He cut a hole through the wall with his lightsaber, and Rex and the others entered the tunnels, with Rex having Fives and Echo replace the severed hole behind them to avoid detection by Sobeck's pursuant forces. As they headed for the entrance to a pipeline network, Skywalker took up position at the rear to guard their flank from the droids sent to recapture them, while Tano led the group onward. Along the way, Rex defended Tano's abilities from Tarkin, who doubted that the young Padawan was capable of leading them to safety. After they found themselves at a dead end in the caverns, B2 super battle droids and droid commandos caught up with them, with the commandos sporting personal energy shields to counter the clone troopers' blasters. While Rex, Skywalker, and their soldiers faced down the droids, Tano used thermal detonators that Rex had been carrying in a supply backpack to rupture the obstructive wall, saving two of the explosives to use on the shield-wielding droid commandos. Both the wall and the droids were blasted apart, allowing Rex and his comrades to travel on toward the pipeline.\n\nRex and the others entered the large fuel line to ascend a ridge; they were to meet R2-D2 and their escape shuttle at the cliff's zenith. Due to the risk of igniting the flammable fuel within the pipe, Rex and the other troopers deactivated their lights and locked their weapons during their climb. Upon exiting the fuel line at the top of the cliff, Rex and his comrades were faced with a squad of B1 battle droids and LM-432 crab droids. While Skywalker and Tano deflected the battle droids' fire, Rex and Tarkin headed for cover with their men behind a series of nearby hills. After joining them, Skywalker used a thermal detonator from Rex to explode the section of the fuel line that they had just exited, leaving the droids in pieces. As Kenobi and the shuttle had not yet reached the pipeline, Rex and the others resorted to their backup plan\u2014meeting Kenobi at his position instead. Rex helped one of Piell's injured clone officers to the Citadel's rear landing platform, where Kenobi, Piell, and their soldiers were battling Sobeck's forces to reclaim their shuttle, from which the droids had separated them. Rex, Skywalker, Tano, Tarkin, and their group joined Kenobi's squad at their cover behind several crates, but their refuge was compromised with the arrival of battle droids aboard STAPs, which soared in to attack them from behind.\n\nWhen Echo attempted to commandeer the shuttle, one of the platform's droid-manned blaster turrets blew apart the craft. The resulting explosion claimed Echo's life as well as the shuttle. Their only means of escaping off-world now gone with their comrade-in-arms, the Republic team was forced to retreat from the Citadel. Once Skywalker and Kenobi had requested retrieval from Koon and the High Council, Rex and his comrades proceeded away from the prison, across the perilous and barely navigable landscape of Lola Sayu. Rex, Cody, and Fives scouted ahead for the team as they traveled through a series of caves partitioned by rivers of sulfur. Taking advantage of the brief lack of pursuant droids, Piell contacted Yoda and Mace Windu at the Jedi Temple. With Koon's rescue fleet of cruisers already en route to Lola Sayu, Yoda and Windu informed Piell and the others that their rendezvous point with Koon's evacuation ships would be a small island in the middle of a lake of lava. When a trio of droid commandos caught up with them, Fives tossed a thermal detonator, making quick work of their pursuers. Yet Sobeck's forces did not relent in their pursuit and next tried to surround Rex and his comrades at a cliff, with battle droids approaching from the rear and a crab droid attacking from a nearby cliff face.\n\nWhile R2-D2's reprogrammed battle droids delayed Sobeck's forces, Rex and the others used ascension cables to descend the cliff; Rex helped a clone officer down the ridge. Despite losing two troopers, they pressed on along a river of lava leading to the island rendezvous point. The group soon heard distant howling and realized that Sobeck had released a pack of hunters to lead his battle droids to them\u2014specifically, the hunters were dangerous anooba trackers. As the anoobas were not far behind, the Jedi decided to use a nearby cave to their advantage: Once Skywalker and Kenobi had led the anoobas past the cave, Rex, Tano, Piell, and their men would surprise them and their accompanying battle droids from behind. After the anooba pack passed by, Rex and his team rushed to join Skywalker and Kenobi, but several crab droids intercepted them. While Tano and Piell held off the crab droids, Rex pushed on with Tarkin, Cody, and the clones to Skywalker's position, where they found him and Kenobi in battle with the anoobas and a squadron of STAPs. Although the anoobas and droids were defeated, the victory came at a high cost: Piell died in combat with the anoobas. Tano\u2014to whom Piell, with his final breath, had designated his half of the Nexus Route coordinates\u2014brought the body back to the others, who were saddened to learn of the Jedi Councilor's sacrifice.\n\nEven with Sobeck pursuing them, Rex and his comrades paused to honor the fallen Piell, cremating his body in the lava of Lola Sayu. Once Piell had joined with the landscape, the Republic team continued on to the island. With sulfurous lava separating them from the island, Skywalker and Cody each connected a cable to the opposite shore, erecting a line across the magma, and Rex and Tarkin were the first to climb across. As the others traversed the cables, Sobeck personally arrived with a squad of STAP-mounted droid commandos to reclaim his prisoners. A fierce lightfight ensued, with Rex and his men battling Sobeck's forces in a final stand. Unwilling to let the Nexus Route coordinates reach the Republic, Sobeck tried to murder Tarkin, but Tano killed the warden before he could do so. Just as Koon and Clone Commander CC-3636, nicknamed \"Wolffe,\" arrived aboard a gunship to rescue the Republic team, hordes of crab droids appeared and surrounded the Jedi and clones. After providing cover fire for the Jedi, Rex and his men boarded Koon's space gunship and lifted off from Lola Sayu. They and their starfighter escort\u2014provided by Adi Gallia, Saesee Tiin, and Kit Fisto\u2014reached Koon's fleet of Star Destroyers, which withdrew to hyperspace.\n\nRex and the other survivors of the Citadel mission returned to Coruscant with Koon's fleet. During debriefing, the Jedi High Council encountered problems with processing the Nexus Route intelligence, as Tarkin had been instructed to take his half of the information directly to the Supreme Chancellor, while Tano, obeying Piell's dying wishes, intended to see that it was entrusted to the High Council. To resolve the matter, Yoda entered into discussions with Palpatine to determine the best way to debrief the information for Republic use.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Campaign on Ereesus[]\n\nRex and Sergeant Coric were dispatched to review security on the agriworld Biitu, where the Biituians were repurposing Separatist battle droid scrap as raw materials to be sold to the Republic Senate. Rex and Coric brought along a detachment from Torrent Company aboard an LAAT/i gunship to the Pitor Processing Plantworks, where a disturbance had been reported, though GAR command did not provide specifics. As they approached the Plantworks, Coric voiced his disregard for war profiteers like the Biituians, though Rex admonished him for his disrespectful attitude. Upon landing, they were greeted by Pitor, the foreman in charge of operations. Pitor brushed off the report of a \"disturbance\" and took the opportunity to give Rex and his squad a tour of the large facility, which, being the largest of its kind in the Outer Rim, received huge quantities of dismembered battle droids by the day. When Rex questioned Pitor as to why his men's presence had been requested, Pitor revealed that a battle droid calling itself the Reanimator, having forged himself from the bodies of his fallen comrades, had begun to bring the scrap droids back to life. Although Rex and Coric initially had trouble believing Pitor's tale, the Reanimator\u2014an IG-100 MagnaGuard with a faulty neural processor\u2014attacked Torrent Company at that moment, forcing them to take cover. While Pitor barricaded himself in his office, Rex's men fell one by one to the Reanimator and his droid army until only Rex, Coric, and a third trooper remained.\n\nRex ordered a retreat so that they could find one of the Reanimator's weaknesses and exploit it. He and Coric helped their injured comrade to Pitor's office, where Coric forced Pitor to let them inside. As the enemy droids closed in, Rex devised a plan that would combine Pitor's skills with Coric's suicidal sense of duty. Proceeding to the roof, Rex and Pitor manned magnetic grapples that would allow Coric to pose as a clone trooper with Force powers. When the Reanimator arrived with his droids, Rex's ruse distracted the Reanimator long enough for Coric to place a blaster shot through the droid's head. The clone soldiers remained at the Plantworks for another day to eliminate the rest of the droids. Their report of the incident resulted in the Senate agreeing to implement stringent checks on all Biitu-bound salvage shipments to prevent further complications, as deliveries of still-operable battle droids had been the agent of the catastrophe. Rex, Coric, and their men received Pitor's thanks before departing. As they lifted off, Coric commented to Rex that despite his still-low opinion of profiteers like Pitor, he had learned that the only reliable battle droid was a properly recycled one.\n\nOn another assignment without Skywalker, Rex and Torrent Company traveled to the planet Ereesus in the Outer Rim, where they entered into a collaboration with the local Ereesus Planetary Security Forces to repel a Confederate invasion. After establishing a forward operating base, Rex and his soldiers initiated an assault on the droid battle group, which was being overseen by a number of T-series tactical droids. The Republic's campaign soon took a turn for the worst, as the Separatists captured a squad led by Planetary Security Forces Sergeant Palola\u2014along with their Torrent Company liaison, Oz\u2014while gaining substantial ground, threatening to collapse the 501st Legion's left flank. The same night, Rex and his men learned of the Separatists' demands for the hostage militiamen via a two-minute holographic transmission from the tactical droid who had seized the squad. Adding to Rex's growing headache were numerous rebukes from generals in Sector Command concerning the fragile and crumbling situation.\n\nRex was soon sought out at the forward base by Lieutenant Sollaw ap-Orwien and Corporal Dafyd, the former of whom asked to view the holorecording of the captive squad to see what Palola had said. Rex mistook ap-Orwien's entreaty for a misconceived notion, as the tactical droid had not allowed Palola to utter a single word during the transmission, but ap-Orwien insisted that due to being a Lorrdian like Palola, he could discern a message. As Rex brought ap-Orwien and Dafyd to the operations room, the former explained that during the Kanz Disorders of millennia prior, the Argazdan Myrialites had enslaved the Lorrdians and barred them from speaking. To the stupefaction of Rex and troopers Jesse and Ringo, ap-Orwien\u2014instantly after taking his eyes off the transmission\u2014relayed key intelligence from Palola. The Lorrdian sergeant, Oz, and their five comrades were being held in a depot at the top of the Hidaci Ridge; the tactical droid's base of operations was a granary halfway up; and the Separatists had stockpiled fuel and artillery on the road along the ridge.\n\nAp-Orwien continued his explanation of the kinetic communication that the Lorrdians had developed during the Kanz Disorders, which had allowed them to communicate via the most minuscule movements and gestures ever since. As an example, ap-Orwien left the room, with Dafyd listening in as Rex relayed some made-up tactical information to Jesse and Ringo. They were further impressed when ap-Orwien reentered and, after exchanging wordless kinetic communication with Dafyd that almost missed Rex's scrutiny, repeated the fictitious orders word-for-word. After confirming with Sector Command, Rex devised a strategy to rescue Palola's squad from the Hidaci Ridge depot. To divert the Separatists' attention, he dispatched a squadron of BTL-B Y-wing starfighters to launch a bombing run on the fuel and artillery dumps. A sham 501st advance would further draw the battle droids south and allow the extraction team's gunship to move in on the hostage site from the north. Rex selected Jesse, Ringo, and Dogma, one of their recent recruits, to accompany himself, ap-Orwien, and Dafyd on the team, with Kix serving as their medic. Rex set the plan into motion that night, deploying the starfighters to deliver their ordnance while he departed with ap-Orwien, Dafyd, and the others on a stealth-outfitted gunship.\n\nBy the light of Ereesus's moon, Rex and his comrades flew to the Hidaci Ridge and lowered cables to the surface, fast-roping from the gunship into the depot. They landed at a speeder truck loading dock, where Rex and his soldiers switched on their night vision filters while the Lorrdian militiamen strapped night vision goggles over their eyes. Once they scanned the yard for hostiles, the team used explosives to blow open the main door and proceeded into the depot. Jesse and Ringo set a second set of charges to breach another door in the facility's office, which led downstairs to where Palola had reported that he and the other captives were being held. Immediately after the explosives did their work, Rex had Dogma toss an EMP grenade down the stairwell leading into the basement to deactivate the droid forces within. Following Jesse and Ringo into the basement, Rex placed a blaster bolt through the head of a still-twitching battle droid. However, as the troopers and militiamen discovered, Dogma's electromagnetic pulse had not disabled all of the droids. While Rex and the others deactivated their night vision filters, Jesse yelled out from further down the stairs that there were still-active droid commandos. Rex rushed down the stairs in an attempt to spot the enemy droids, but in doing so, he narrowly avoided a commando that detached itself from the pipes on the ceiling and brought its vibrosword through where his head had been a moment prior.\n\nThe droid commando landed behind Rex and kicked him down the stairwell, then pinned him chest-down on the ground\u2014resulting in a bloody mouth on his part, with his hands and blaster pistols trapped beneath him. Ap-Orwien came to his aid, decapitating the commando with a blaster bolt and allowing Rex to free himself from under the now-defunct droid's body. With the rest of the droid commandos disabled, Rex and his team headed for the locked door at the bottom of the stairwell. He had explosive charges placed to blow open the door, with Dogma again tossing an EMP grenade through the rupture. On the other side, Rex smartly gunned down a droid commando that tried to pounce on them from the ceiling. He and his comrades were relieved to find Palola, Oz, and the other five hostages safe with minimal injuries.\n\nAlthough Rex was about to radio the gunship for an immediate retrieval, he instead decided to act on Palola's findings, confirming from the Lorrdian that their tactical droid captor was headquartered in the nearby granary. Rex led his team and the former hostages to the granary, where they raided the droid encampment and captured the tactical droid's cranial unit. He and the others then returned to Torrent Company's base. When ap-Orwien asked if he and his fellow militiamen could spend the night at the 501st's base, since it was too late for them to return to their own headquarters, Rex told them it would be an honor to have them bunk with Torrent Company. Still, he smiled and declined ap-Orwien's offer for a game of sabacc, not willing to gamble with such masters of nonverbal communication as the Lorrdians.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Wartime assignments[]\n\nWhen a group of clone troopers, having just pilfered the coordinates for the Separatist hypermatter generators, crashed on the Hutt Space world Asuin, Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi were tasked with rescuing the clone squad before the Confederacy could recover the intelligence. After Rex pinpointed the location of the squad's escape pod on the surface via scanning, Skywalker and Kenobi moved in to secure the craft. While battling the Separatists, Rex made contact with his Jedi Generals and reported that battle droid reinforcements led by Asajj Ventress were heading for their position. Skywalker and Kenobi managed to rescue the sole surviving trooper of the crash, but Ventress then confronted them. Although she destroyed J-3PO, the protocol droid containing the hypermatter generator coordinates, Skywalker and Kenobi were able to escape from the battlefield.\n\nShortly after the planet Makem Te rejoined the Republic, the Separatists deployed an advanced tank known as the Bogg Behemoth on the world. The Jedi Council dispatched Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi to combat the new threat. Taking a battle group of HAVw A6 Juggernaut tanks and a clone legion to Makem Te, Rex and his Jedi Generals found the Bogg Behemoth in the desert near the city Thousand Thousand. Even with commandos supporting their elite detachment, Rex voiced skepticism to Skywalker and Kenobi that they would be able to capture the Bogg Behemoth, as they had been ordered to do. Because intelligence alleged that the Bogg Behemoth was still undergoing final testing, Kenobi mobilized their forces in a preliminary strike before the tank came online. When Rex led his men against the Bogg Behemoth, their intelligence proved to be faulty\u2014the tank, already functional, began to launch scores of missiles at the clone soldiers.\n\nThough Rex had the Republic's AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons return fire at the Bogg Behemoth, the tank's shield and heavy armor afforded it sufficient protection to endure the thick bombardment. With their men taking losses, Skywalker and Kenobi elected to instead assault the Bogg Behemoth from above. Rex and the Jedi landed their troopers on the tank via LAAT/i gunships, but hundreds of DSD1 dwarf spider droids confronted them before they could secure the deck. As Rex and his soldiers held out against the dwarf spider droids, Skywalker and Kenobi infiltrated the tank and forced its Geonosian operator, Bogg, to deactivate the vehicle and its defenses. Despite the clones' capture of the Bogg Behemoth, Kenobi chose to destroy it, as he simply did not believe that the Republic could adapt such destructive weapons for proper ethical use.\n\nOn another occasion, Rex joined Kenobi, Cody, and a company from the 212th Attack Battalion to claim Bogoa, a world whose durable coral was coveted by the Confederacy for use as ship-building material. After battling the Separatists for three days, the Republic forces managed to compromise the enemy stranglehold. During the following interlude in fighting, Rex remained at the Republic's staging area with Kenobi and the 212th infantry while Cody embarked on roundup duty, searching for survivors amidst the carnage on the battlefield. Cody soon found the B1 battle droid Coppertop, whose battle protocols had been peculiarly overridden; the droid had subsequently deserted the Separatist Droid Army to aid the wounded from both sides of the conflict. When Asajj Ventress and the bounty hunter Cyreltov attempted to reclaim Coppertop for Count Dooku, who had issued the experimental Order 99 directive that had modified Coppertop's objectives, Coppertop sacrificed himself to prevent Kenobi and Ventress from fighting over him. Ventress and Cyreltov thereafter retreated from Bogoa, having failed to retrieve Coppertop, while Kenobi and the clone troopers recovered from the battle.\n\nRex joined Skywalker and Tano in contesting the Confederacy's claim to the jungle planet Zeenada, where a large Separatist invasion force soon outgunned them. In response, Skywalker had Rex and Tano take a squad around the battle droid lines and stage a diversionary assault on the enemy's rear position. Doing so would cause the Separatists to believe that the Republic's main force was behind them, allowing Skywalker to capture the droids in a pincer maneuver. While circling around the enemy infantry, Rex and Tano encountered a droid patrol. By the time the droids had been eliminated, only Rex, Tano, and two other troopers\u2014Gunner and Sarge\u2014remained of their squad. Rex advised that they abort the mission and return to Skywalker for reinforcements, but Tano reminded them that Skywalker was depending on them to fulfill their objective. When they came across a wild feline predator, Tano ordered Rex, Gunner, and Sarge to avoid firing at it unless absolutely necessary while she distracted the creature. Yet she was unable to defeat the predator, and when she felt the ground shaking underneath them, she quickly Force-pushed Rex and the others aside. The threat turned out to be an incoming pack of wild animals, but Rex and the others were able to avoid the stampede.\n\nAlthough Sarge and Gunner were skeptical of Tano's experience on the battlefield, Rex ordered them to respect her command, as she was in charge. They proceeded through the Zeenada jungle, eventually arriving at a swamp right behind the Separatists' rear flank. Rex was not enthusiastic about having to trudge through the swamp, but Tano believed that they could cross it via several rocks running through the marsh. However, the rocks\u2014which were actually reptilian eggs\u2014turned out to be yet another example of Zeenada's native wildlife: They hatched into massive swamp beasts, whose parent proceeded to attack Tano. While Tano ordered Rex and his men to safety, she had the idea to lure the beast onto the battlefield to attack the battle droids. Her plan worked, and while Skywalker ordered his forces to assault the droids' frontal flank, Rex, Gunner, and Sarge crossed the swamp and jumped into battle alongside Tano.\n\nWhen Republic Admiral Tenant and the crew of his Star Destroyer crew intercepted a message containing a 2,000-year-old Jedi distress code, the Jedi High Council sent Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi to investigate the location of its origin: the remote Chrelythiumn system, a site far beyond the Outer Rim Territories in the relatively unexplored region of the galaxy termed Wild Space. Since the Jedi Council suspected a Separatist scheme, Rex was dispatched aboard a heavily armed Venator-class Star Destroyer to meet up with the three Jedi at the source. Although both Rex's Star Destroyer and Skywalker's Eta-class shuttle arrived at the rendezvous point and established contact via the HoloNet, a peculiar situation arose: Neither Rex's cruiser nor the Jedi's shuttle were able to locate each other on their scanners. The peculiarity of the situation escalated when an outside source cut off Skywalker's holographic connection to the warship. While the concerned Rex continued his attempts to locate them, the Father\u2014a powerful Force wielder who maintained the mysterious world known as Mortis\u2014transported Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi there. The Father wished to test Skywalker, who was believed to be the Chosen One of an ancient Jedi prophecy.\n\nAfter Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi underwent a series of tribulations on Mortis, they awoke aboard their shuttle. Seeing their craft reappear on his scanners, Rex reestablished holographic contact with them, confirming that they were all right. Although Rex did not understand when Skywalker stated that their communications blackout had lasted for more than a moment, Skywalker, commenting that they could not explain their ordeal, brought in their shuttle to join Rex aboard his Star Destroyer.\n\n",

Presenting the spear to Djarin, Tano stated that she believed Elsbeth's spear had been payment for Tano's defeat. However, Djarin refused the offer, citing how he hadn't completed the task, which Tano affirmed, but stated that she believed a Mandalorian should possess the spear. As Djarin took the weapon, Tano asked where Grogu was, to which Djarin revealed that he was on the ship and that he would retrieve the infant. As Djarin walked away, Tano gave a troubled look before she was joined by Governor Wing who she gesturing to head back into the city along with her as a gesture of friendship. The two then proudly walked back inside the city's walls.\n\nLater, Tano was present outside Djarin's gunship, the Razor Crest as Djarin was exiting with Grogu in hand to give to her to train. As he stepped outside, Tano stated that Grogu now saw Djarin as his father and once again stated that she could not train the youngling. Djarin was shocked by this, stating that he had held up his end of their bargain as Tano walked closer to him and took hold of Grogu's left hand. As she reached the two, Tano directed Djarin to the planet Tython where she recommended that he place Grogu on the seeing stone at the top of a mountain containing the ruins of an ancient temple with a strong connection to the Force. Djarin then questioned what he was supposed to do from there, to which Tano answered that Grogu would then be able to choose his own path and that if Grogu used the Force to reach out, a Jedi might be able to sense it and come to the planet searching for Grogu. However, she also stated that there were few remaining Jedi, which could possibly present a problem for the two. Djarin then thanked Tano and she wished for the Force to be with the two before smiling and bowing her head for Grogu, watching as the pair left in their gunship. With this, Tano began walking back towards Calodan, smiling.",

        "content": "# Rex - On the front lines of battle[]\n\nHaving become a foothold of Separatist strength since the onset of the Clone Wars, Felucia was engulfed in conflict for a second time on account of being situated near the valuable hyperlane known as the Perlemian Trade Route. Rex went with Skywalker and Tano to repel the Confederacy from Felucia, leading a clone trooper division of AT-TE walkers into the heart of enemy territory. They encountered squads of battle droids as they went but gained much ground, eventually joining forces with Plo Koon and Commander Wolffe to capture a Confederate outpost, to which General Grievous was sending reinforcements to fortify his hold on the system. As night fell, the Jedi and clones moved their forces to a ridge overlooking the outpost just as a C-9979 landing craft arrived with the droid reinforcements. Koon decided on a three-pronged assault plan to secure the outpost: While Koon and Wolffe attacked the base's left flank, Tano would breach the rear entrance with troops from Wolffe's Wolfpack, a squad within the Grand Army's 104th Battalion. Meanwhile, Rex and Skywalker would spearhead the frontal assault on the station. Once Skywalker's Felucian scouts had found them a secure way to the path leading to the outpost, Rex positioned half of their soldiers amidst the dense foliage on one side of the path, while Skywalker did the same along the other side.\n\nWith all of their forces in place, Koon had their AT-TE walkers deliver long-range fire at the outpost from the ridge. The cannonades baited tactical droid commander TZ-33's droid defenders out of the front entrance, and Rex and Skywalker began their attack once several DSD1 dwarf spider droids had been lured out into the jungle. Rex and Skywalker cut through the battle droids and joined Koon in capturing the base's command center, eliminating TZ-33. Although the enemy station had been secured, Tano was nowhere to be found\u2014unbeknownst to her comrades, Trandoshan hunters had captured her for a ritualistic hunt on the moon Wasskah. Rex and his team received orders to return to Coruscant the next morning. As they prepared to leave Felucia, Skywalker had Rex and his men search the conquered outpost and the surrounding area for Tano several times, to no avail. With gunships waiting for them, Skywalker was forced to call off the search, hoping that Republic forces or spies in the Confederacy would locate his Padawan. Tano was later rescued from Wasskah and safely returned to the Jedi Temple.\n\nFollowing the Second Battle of Felucia, Grievous oversaw a Separatist invasion of the Calamari system, home to the Mon Calamari shipbuilders who were key to the Republic war effort. After the King of Mon Cala, Yos Kolina, was assassinated, Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala were sent to quell the political tensions between the Mon Calamari and the Quarren in the wake of his death, hoping to stem the impending threat of a Mon Calamari\u2013Quarren civil war. Despite their best efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict, Skywalker and Amidala were unable to stop the Quarren from seceding from the Republic in favor of an alliance with Commander Riff Tamson of the Confederacy. Upon learning that civil war on Mon Cala was now inevitable and imminent, the Jedi High Council immediately commissioned a company of clone troopers for underwater combat to prevent the world from falling to Separatist control. Rex, Tano, and Kit Fisto were appointed to oversee the reinforcements for the Mon Calamari. Yet the battle began before they could arrive when Tamson and Quarren chieftain Nossor Ri led an assault on the undersea capital, Mon Calamari City, where Captain Gial Ackbar of the Mon Calamari Guard was hosting Skywalker and Amidala.\n\nAfter arriving in the Calamari system aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, Rex remained on the bridge to supervise the clone detachment's deployment into the Calamari Sea. LAAT/i gunships took Tano, Fisto, Clone Commander Monnk, and their clone SCUBA troopers, all outfitted in submersible gear, to sea level, where they dove into the waters of Mon Cala. Using OMS Devilfish subs to reach Mon Calamari City, Tano, Fisto, and their men joined Skywalker, Amidala, Ackbar, and Kolina's son, Prince Lee-Char, in the ongoing battle against the allied forces of the Separatists and Quarren. Thanks to further reinforcements from Naboo's Gungan Grand Army, the Jedi and clones bested Tamson's forces, with Nossor Ri and the Quarren realigning with the Mon Calamari and the Republic under newly appointed King Lee-Char.\n\nAs the war progressed, Rex made the jump from the old Phase I armor to the more advanced Phase II equipment. Despite not being partial to the new gear, he developed a unique personal suit of Phase II armor, integrating the advanced equipment with salvaged Phase I parts. His troops in the 501st Legion and Torrent Company also adopted Phase II armor, carrying over their famous blue-marked design.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Anakin's student\n\nTano's relationship with her master was tenuous to start. Skywalker did not want a Padawan, particularly one that was inexperienced and argued with him. Skywalker had also maintained that he would never take on a Padawan learner for fear that he would be \"slowed down,\" so he was originally strongly opposed to Master Yoda's assigning of the young Ahsoka to him. Tano was offended by this, and deeply hurt, but she was eager to prove herself to her new teacher. Yoda hoped that Tano's apprenticeship would teach Skywalker to have better control over his other, more dangerous emotions.\n\nTano's enthusiasm often came at odds with her brash nature, a trait shared by Skywalker himself. In fact, in part due to her youthful impulsiveness and bravery, she was the perfect Padawan for Skywalker. The two would often butt heads, each believing that they knew better than the other. During their first mission together at the Battle of Christophsis, they developed demeaning nicknames for each other; Tano gave her master the diminutive title \"Skyguy,\" while Skywalker returned the favor with the name \"Snips,\" referring to Tano's snippy wit. Tano used the nickname Skyguy only because it annoyed Skywalker, although, as the war progressed, these nicknames would remain by changing into more playful terms of friendship. Skywalker also quickly came to respect Tano's bravery and determination, and he recognized that Tano was just as reckless as him.\n\nFor all their bickering, the two developed a close relationship during the Clone Wars. Skywalker reassured his Padawan that their meeting was no accident and that it was the will of the Force for her to train under him. Their rapport made it's way onto the battlefield, with the duo competing to see who could destroy the most droids during the Second Battle of Geonosis. The master and apprentice grew increasingly reliant on each other throughout the war, taking turns rescuing each other from Separatist forces and bounty hunters. After situations where she was nearly killed, she found that she could talk to her mentor to come to terms with it. Tano's naive outlook balanced with Skywalker's cynical approach. During her time on Mortis, Tano was killed by the Son and only resurrected after Skywalker pleaded with the Father to help save her. Later, after being captured by Trandoshan hunters, Tano credited her master's teachings as the one thing that allowed her to survive.\n\nSkywalker grew protective of his Padawan, which Tano viewed as a lack of trust in her abilities. During the mission to Lola Sayu, Tano directly disobeyed Skywalker and joined his team, believing she should be the one to decide when to put her life in danger, not her master. Later, when Tano went on the run after being accused of murder, she realized that Skywalker was the only person who would believe in her innocence and begged him to trust that she would make the right decision. Ultimately, however, Tano left the Jedi Order, knowing that she had to discover more about herself without the help of her master. Skywalker confessed to his Padawan that he too understood the desire to leave the Order, and Tano, who had become aware of a connection between her master and Senator Amidala, but had never pushed the issue, assured him that she knew.\n\nDuring her time away from the Order, Tano held her master in respect, regarding him as her own brother and later as a father figure. The lessons she had learned from him stayed with her in her exile; when asked by Trace Martez where she had learned to fly, the former Padawan credited her skills to \"Skywalker Academy.\" Even still, when she was approached by the Nite Owls to join in the fight against Maul, Tano feared that she would become closer to the life and master she had left behind, but knew that she must go with them to help others. As she came face-to-face with Skywalker prior to the Siege of Mandalore, she did not indulge an emotional reunion and focused her attention on convincing the Jedi to assist the Mandalorians. In their final meeting as friends, Skywalker gifted Tano with her old lightsabers, now shining with blue blades, just as his own did. Before Skywalker left, Tano allowed her emotions to be shown, thanking him for his help and wishing him luck.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Searching for Grand Admiral Thrawn\n\nWhen Syndulla asked about the mercenaries' connection to Elsbeth, Tano said that she had hired them for plausible deniability. Tano also showed Syndulla the golden orb, explaining that Elsbeth had been interested in this map since she believed it would lead to the location of Thrawn, the last Imperial Grand Admiral. Syndulla was surprised that Thrawn had survived the Battle of Lothal, but Tano explained that she had heard whispers of his survival. Syndulla asked if this meant that Ezra Bridger was alive. Tano was uncertain but warned that their enemies were also searching.\n\nSyndulla wanted to look at the map, but the key required to activate the map eluded Huyang. Syndulla remarked that it was never straightforward with the Jedi. A Mon Calamari officer informed Syndulla that the Defense Council was requesting an update from her. Syndulla said she would attend to the matter and told Tano she knew who could help her. Tano was uncertain that this friend would help, but Syndulla reassured her that she would do it for Bridger.\n\nLater that day, Governor Ryder Azadi gave a speech to the citizens of Lothal, celebrating the aniiversary of its liberation shortly before the Galactic Civil War. Still residing on Lothal, Sabine Wren, who was set to speak to Lothals community, failed to appear at the celebration, instead returning to the communications tower. Tano soon arrived on the planet, and parked her T-6 shuttle near a ledge on a high tower. Wren arrived while Tano was talking to Governor Azadi. When Azadi said that Wren had missed the ceremony yesterday, Wren replied that it had slipped her mind. Azadi said everyone had missed her, but Wren replied that not everyone had been there. Huyang also greeted Sabine, who recognized him. Huyang said he still had 75 percent original parts before returning to the ship. Azadi told Wren to listen to what Tano had to say before leaving. Tano then told Wren that she knew a way to find Bridger while showing her the orb.\n\nThe two went inside Ahsoka's T-6 Jedi shuttle and discussed the situation. Wren gazed at a bunk with several wall drawings, including a loth-cat. When Wren asked if she was certain Bridger was still out there, Tano responded that whilst nothing was certain, their enemy was seeking Thrawn, which was what had led her to the map. Tano explained she had found the map on the planet Arcana, a Nightsister stronghold thousands of years ago. Due to her skills as an artist, Tano sought Wren's help in deciphering the map. Wren believed there was a code. Tano shared a scan of the Nightsister temple chamber where they had found it. When questioned about where home was, Tano described her soul as a home. Both women blamed each other for not making it easy for each other. Tano replied that the Jedi way was hard.\n\nJust then, Huyang had an update. Wren asked for permission to take the map and study it. Tano refused since she believed the map was not just about finding Bridger but preventing another war. She warned Wren that the map stayed aboard the ship before entering the lab to chat with Huyang. Huyang had scanned Skoll's and Hati's lightsabers. The droid said that he recognized one of the two hilts, which was built in the Jedi style. The one he knew belonged to Baylan Skoll, who had disappeared at the end of the Clone Wars. Huyang told Ahsoka that Skoll had been Jedi trained. Tano surmised that Hati was Skoll's apprentice. He warned Tano that Skoll wouldn't be alone for long. When Tano returned to the briefing room, Wren had already left with the map despite Tano's instructions.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The Clone Wars\n\nTano started out very young and naive because of the way the show was written, the crew's own naiveness, and their lack of experience. As \"Downfall of a Droid\" was initially the second episode to be developed for the Clone Wars series, Ahsoka's maneuver when attempting to fly between the Separatist frigates would've explained Anakin's hesitance for her to fly in the later produced episode \"Shadow of Malevolence,\" although \"Shadow of Malevolence\" would later be revealed to take place prior to \"Downfall of a Droid.\" Ahsoka's visions within the Clone Wars episode \"Assassin\" were made to have the same distorted effect as her master Anakin's did in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. In an early version of the script for the episode, Ahsoka visited the young bounty hunter Boba Fett in his prison cell in an attempt to learn information upon his former ally Aurra Sing.\n\nAhsoka's model was updated for The Clone Wars: Season Three to suggest time had passed, further showcasing that she had grown older, more mature, and more experienced. The updated character model debuted in the episode \"Heroes on Both Sides.\" The update was first teased to fans in an announcement article on StarWars.com\u2014which revealed a screenshot of Tano and Skywalker's updated models and a promotional image of the two of them with Kenobi in his own updated model\u2014on November 16, 2010. Also included was a link to a promotional video showcasing the three new models in action, featuring Tano leaping to the ground before her two mentors and igniting both her lightsabers. While Kenobi and Skywalker's updates brought their designs closer to their appearances in Revenge of the Sith, The Clone Wars crew had to work around the lack of any live-action reference for Tano, but her character development was as noticeable as any other cast member's: as Filoni explained to StarWars.com in the announcement article, Tano had much to learn at the start of the war, but she had grown and changed, which was reflected in her older, more mature appearance. Furthermore, he promised \"Heroes on Both Sides\" was yet another step forward in her emotional journey as she met Separatists face-to-face.\n\nFor the Clone Wars episode \"Ghosts of Mortis,\" the model for Ahsoka's goggles was repurposed from the one used for Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang. In the Clone Wars episode \"Citadel Rescue,\" Saesee Tiin's starfighter was modeled with the same pattern as Ahsoka's starfighter. When Wilhuff Tarkin enters Ahsoka's cell in the Clone Wars episode \"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much,\" it is framed as a homage to when Darth Vader enters Leia Organa's cell aboard the Death Star in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Similar to this, his interaction with her while in her cell was meant to mirror his interaction with Leia shortly before he commands the destruction of Alderaan. Ahsoka's leap from the water pipe in the Clone Wars episode \"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much\" is an homage to a similar scene in 1993 film The Fugitive. When Filoni and the crew were writing the story about Tano leaving the Jedi Order, they made it about her being pulled in different directions and becoming frustrated. They wanted to show young people that they can take a predetermined path or use the information to make their own choice.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Training the Onderon rebels[]\n\nIn 20 BBY, as the Clone Wars entered their third year, Rex accompanied Kenobi to the Jedi Temple to watch a sparring duel between Jedi Master Quinlan Vos and a Jedi Knight. New orders came in soon enough for Rex when the High Council received a plea for aid from the Onderon rebels, a grass-roots insurgency based on the planet Onderon. Despite their world's alignment with the Confederacy, the rebels refused to recognize the legitimacy of their Separatist-loyal monarch, King Sanjay Rash, and sought to deliver Onderon from battle droid occupation. Instead of direct intervention by way of the Grand Army, Skywalker developed the idea of sponsoring training for the local rebels, the objective being to teach them self-sufficiency while also engaging the Separatists on another front. Rex joined Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi as the fourth member of the team of advisors who would be instructing the rebels. Once they had prepared for the journey to Onderon, Lieutenant Hawk transported them to the night side of Onderon aboard the Republic shuttle Valkyrie 2929, hovering over the drop zone in the Onderonian jungle long enough for Rex and his robed Jedi comrades to reach the ground via a jetpack and the Force, respectively. They were soon found by a dalgo-back patrol of guerrillas led by the young Steela Gerrera, who took Rex and the others to the insurgency's secret base a half-kilometer to the east.\n\nRex and his comrades arrived at the rebel camp at daybreak, at which point Steela introduced them to her brother, Saw, the self-proclaimed leader of the insurgency. Among the other rebels was Lux Bonteri, the quondam senator of Onderon and an old friend of Tano. Skywalker and Kenobi wasted no time in launching the insurgency's training, calling a gathering to introduce themselves to their new trainees. After Rex took a group of volunteers to retrieve supplies from their entry point, the Jedi decided to begin with a session on countering an Armored Assault Tank, a common sight amidst the Separatists' forward infantry. Using a captured tank as a visual aid, Tano laid out the vehicle's schematics to their rebel trainees, explaining that both the top and front hatches had to be disabled to fully immobilize the tank. As a demonstration, Rex, taking an EMP grenade in each hand, tossed one charge into the front cabin and then swung onto the main cannon to reach the topside chamber. He somersaulted off the tank a moment before it was disabled by the combined electromagnetic pulse. To practice the maneuver, Skywalker organized the rebels into teams of two, as each soldier would be able to target a separate port. Although the first pair, Saw and Bonteri, botched their attempt when the latter lost his hold on the main turret, Rex kept the exercise moving, supplying the next few groups with EMP grenades. He rallied each pair through the drill, treating them as soldiers and pushing them to give it their all.\n\nIn the next lesson, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi taught the insurgents how to disable a shielded droideka. Controlling three reprogrammed units from a wrist remote, Rex activated the shield of one of the sample droidekas, then released several blaster shots at the shield to demonstrate its ability to repel high-velocity attacks. Tano presented the solution to the shield: a stationary or slow-moving object, such as a carefully tossed EMP grenade, one of which she lobbed through the shield, deactivating the destroyer droid. When it was time for the rebels to conduct the exercise, only Bonteri mastered it on the first try. Rex broke the soldiers into pairs for further practice, in which others, including Saw, were able to perfect the maneuver. Following that, the Jedi moved on to firearm practice, with Steela exemplifying her natural abilities with a sniper rifle. Rex made sure to inform the rebels that a headshot was the only effective way to deactivate a battle droid, as the enemy units would otherwise continue relaying intelligence to central command. At that point, the insurgency's training escalated into full-blown combat, as a patrol of droids stormed out of the surrounding trees to quash the fledgling rebellion. Rex shouted for everyone to take cover as enemy rockets and cannonades began to fly into the camp.\n\nJumping behind a wall with several of the rebels, Rex opened fire on the invading droids, the first wave of which was demolished thanks to the insurgents' homemade disruptors. The next wave of enemy infantry was headed by an Armored Assault Tank, which spawned considerable devastation across the camp until Bonteri and Saw worked as a team to disable it with thermal detonators, just as Rex and his comrades had taught them. Despite several casualties, the young insurgents emerged victorious over the droids. Emboldened by their success, the rebels decided to infiltrate the capital city of Iziz, where they would bring the fight directly to King Rash and his Confederate supporters. Posing as game hunters with a dalgo-drawn caravan, Rex and the others gained access to the walled Iziz from the battle droid guards at the city gates, then split up to avoid detection. Rex accompanied Tano on her dalgo-drawn cart to find supplies for the rebels, rendezvousing with the others after nightfall.\n\nThe rebels' next course of action was to carry out a series of small-target strikes on battle droid patrols throughout Iziz. Rex helped coordinate one of the assaults, targeting a Separatist checkpoint in the city, while Skywalker, waiting with Steela on a nearby rooftop, observed their performance. After Steela sniped at the B1 battle droid manning the checkpoint, then disabled the security shield's controls with another blast, a DSD1 dwarf spider droid emerged and targeted her from street level. At that point, Rex signaled to the two soldiers accompanying him, and he watched as the insurgents used an EMP grenade to disable the dwarf spider droid. Rex, Skywalker, and the others proceeded with Tano, Kenobi, and the rebels to their safe house in Iziz to review their progress. Although Bonteri, the Gerreras, and the other rebels were proud of their growing number of successes, Kenobi and Tano\u2014who, like Skywalker, had been monitoring the strikes as well as civilian reactions\u2014voiced their concern that the local citizenry was frightened by the outbreaks of violence. While Bonteri proposed that they make a show of strength to garner public support, Rex withdrew from the safe house with Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi.\n\nThe group decided that Skywalker and Kenobi would return to Coruscant to report back to the High Council. Meanwhile, Tano would remain on Onderon as an advisor for the rebellion while also providing firsthand developments to the Council. With that, Rex left for Coruscant with Skywalker and Kenobi. After the rebels won a major victory by destroying Iziz's power generator, Rex was present at their following celebration via hologram with Skywalker and Kenobi, who offered encouragement and advice to the insurgents. In particular, Rex noted that Steela was emerging as a born leader, to which Kenobi agreed. Thanks to their training from Rex and the Jedi, the rebels were able to liberate Onderon from the Confederacy. Although Steela was elected to replace Saw as the rebel leader, she died during their decisive clash with the Separatists, becoming the final casualty in the rebellion's campaign for freedom.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Malastare[]\n\nRex accompanied Skywalker, Windu, and Commander Ponds to oversee the Republic's defense of the beleaguered planet, as the Grand Army coveted its vital fuel reserves. The Supreme Chancellor Palpatine responded by authorizing the use of the electro-proton bomb, a creation of Doctor Sionver Boll that would generate an electron field capable of deactivating the entire droid army. Rex was tasked with shoring up the fortifications of the Doge's Palace\u2014the residence of Doge Nakha Urus, the leader of the Dugs\u2014until the bomb was detonated, and he proceeded to the front of the palace's defense lines to command the Republic troops, monitoring the massive droid army's approach with a set of electrobinoculars. Rex held the line with his men, working in tandem with squads of insectomorph-mounted Dug cavaliers to repel the droid infantry.\n\nA starfighter squadron dropped the electro-proton bomb in the middle of the droid army, producing an explosion that transformed into an electromagnetic pulse. The enlarging pulse disabled all of the droids and disrupted the clone troopers' helmet systems for a short time. The bomb also destabilized the surrounding ground, and Rex nearly fell into the expanding sinkhole when he became trapped on an unstable plateau, but managed to jump to higher ground with the help of his troops. While rescue teams searched for the Republic personnel trapped in the crater, Rex joined Skywalker, Windu, Urus, R2-D2, and Doctor Boll at the Doge's Palace, where they reestablished holographic communications with Palpatine. After Windu and Urus conferred with Palpatine on the status of the Republic's fuel treaty with the Dugs' council, Rex reported that they had lost contact with the rescue team in the crater.\n\nAs night fell, Rex met with Skywalker, Windu, and Boll at Urus's palace to discuss the problem of the uncontrollable Zillo Beast with Palpatine. While the Dugs wanted to kill off the Zillo Beast, the Jedi wanted to preserve the creature, as it was one of the last of its near-extinct species. Skywalker devised a plan to knock out the creature with the Republic's RX-200 Falchion-class assault tanks and then transport it off-world. The Republic forces rendered the Zillo Beast unconscious with Skywalker's strategy, Rex returned with Skywalker and Windu to the Doge's Palace, where Urus and the other Dug leaders signed the fuel treaty. Later, Palpatine ordered they bring it to Coruscant for study before its release into the wild.\n\nRex returned to Coruscant with Skywalker, Windu, and Boll aboard an Acclamator-class transport. The Zillo Beast broke out of the Science and Technical Center and began to rampage across the ecumenopolis of Coruscant. As the creature headed for the Republic Executive Building, Rex joined an LAAT/i gunship force led by Kenobi and Windu that had set out to contain the beast. He contacted Skywalker through R2-D2, both of whom were with Palpatine and Padm\u00e9 Amidala in the Chancellor's Suite at the Executive Building, and confirmed that he was to serve with Kenobi for the time being. Yet when Rex, Kenobi, and Windu reached the Senate Plaza with their detachment of clone troopers and stun tanks, they found that the Zillo Beast had taken hold of the H-2 executive shuttle that Palpatine, Skywalker, and Amidala had been using to flee from the Executive Building with R2-D2 and C-3PO.\n\nRex, monitoring the Zillo Beast and its captives through a pair of macrobinoculars, noticed that Skywalker was cutting the shuttle in half with his lightsaber and notified Windu. Kenobi deduced that Skywalker intended to free himself and the other passengers by severing the ship in two. While the recently arrived Yoda and Aayla Secura ran interference to distract the Zillo Beast, Skywalker finished slicing the shuttle in half, freeing himself and the others from the creature's grip. Kenobi and Windu quickly used the Force to stabilize the section of the shuttle carrying Palpatine and a Senate Commando, preventing them from falling off the dome of the Executive Building. While the stun tanks targeted the Zillo Beast, the LAAT/i gunships launched with Rex, Kenobi, Windu, and their men aboard and also opened fire, though neither approach proved effective in subduing the rampant beast. Palpatine ordered the gunships to release toxic gas bombs that Boll had developed to kill the creature. The next morning, the slain Zillo Beast was transported back to the Science and Technical Center. Rex and his comrades met with Palpatine in the Senate Plaza to debrief the disaster, mourning the loss of the creature. While Rex and the others departed from the Senate Plaza aboard the gunships, Palpatine secretly gave Boll orders to clone the Zillo Beast.\n\n",

        "content": "# Cody - Battle on Saleucami[]\n\nWhen Jedi Council Member Eeth Koth was captured by General Grievous, Cody, with a squad of his troopers went with Kenobi aboard a light cruiser to distract Grievous while Skywalker, Adi Gallia, Captain Rex, and a small squad of troopers aboard a Jedi shuttle were to rescue Master Koth. Cody and Kenobi were successful in getting Grievous's attention. When Grievous's command ship locked on to Kenobi's ship, Cody and his troopers fought against Grievous's commando droids as they boarded the ship. After Grievous' and Kenobi's duel on the Kenobi's ship's bridge, Grievous fled back to his ship. Cody was able to fire a ascension cable at grievous and then he and his men grabbed Grievous, but Grievous overpowered them. Cody and two of his troopers followed Grievous and Kenobi into the docking tube. When Grievous' ship destroyed Kenobi's ship, Cody lost one of his troopers. Luckily, Master Gallia fired an ascension cable to them and Cody, one of his troopers and Kenobi were able to climb out of the docking tube. After Skywalker picked them up, Admiral Yularen told them that one of Grievous's landing ships attempted to land but crashed on Saleucami. Kenobi then decide to take Cody and Rex to find grievous.\n\nAfter Kenobi's forces landed on Saleucami, they all went to what remained of Grievous' landing ship. When they got there, Cody looked at the intake valves which were still warm, meaning that the crash didn't happen that long ago. Kenobi then decided to split up his forces with Rex searching the wetlands while Kenobi, Cody and Crys continued to investigate the crash site. When one of Cody's troopers found a droid, they took it into the AT-TE to look into while continuing their search on the go. Cody was to break the droid's access codes, while Crys was able to power up the droid's guidance system. With this information, they were able to find the other escape pods, hence picking up Grievous's scent. After that Cody and Kenobi found one of the escape pods, but grievous wasn't there, so they move on to the next one. When they found the last escape pod, grievous and his droids were there, waiting for a ship. Cody, Kenobi and their force fought Grievous, but once again Grievous escaped, leaving Cody and Kenobi back where they started.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - The shadows of Umbara[]\n\nThere were indeed more explosives, and Rex and his men were careful to avoid setting them off. However, Umbaran Soldiers subsequently ambushed them from the surrounding forest. In spite of lacking cover from the Umbarans, Rex ordered his men to maintain their position on the road. He took out several Umbarans himself, but the 501st's casualties mounted as the enemy advanced on them, attacking from all sides. With his men surrounded, Rex ordered a retreat so that they could draw the Umbarans out of the darkened jungle. Although the 501st's rear flank endured heavy losses, Rex's plan worked, and his platoons were able to return many of the casualties to the Umbarans, forcing them to abandon their pursuit. Immediately thereafter, Rex was confronted by a greatly displeased Krell, who was outraged that the captain's retreat had ceded control of the road to the Umbarans. Fives protested to Krell's accusations, only to have his defiance silenced when Krell ignited one of his lightsabers and ordered him to stand down. Yet Rex stood his ground, stating that he had followed Krell's orders and, as a result, had lost many men, whose well-being it was his duty to defend. Noting Rex's opinion, Krell acquiesced, deactivating his lightsaber and dismissing him, though Rex and Fives were unable to ascertain if the general's words had been meant as a compliment. The Umbarans had meanwhile regrouped and resumed their assault, and Rex mobilized his men to defend their position.\n\nUpon entering the jungle to combat the Umbarans, Rex and the 501st Legion were faced with the further threat of Umbaran starfighters, whose ray shields effectively repelled their blasterfire. One of the starfighters moved in low to strafe them, and Rex and his men were unable to shoot it down before it pulled out of the vegetation. Rex elected to press toward the Umbaran lines before more starfighters could assail them. When Kix called for support to save some of the wounded, Rex led his men forward to cover Kix's position, having Jesse protect their right flank and Dogma their left. Kix rescued several of the fallen troopers and administered temporary stimulants until they could receive proper medical treatment. In the midst of the fighting, Krell received word that Kenobi was unable to secure the capital due to its overpowering defenses, which were being resupplied by an Umbaran airbase to the west of the city. Before his battalion could advance on the capital, Kenobi required the 501st to capture the airbase so that the city's supply lines would be severed. Krell obliged, and Rex and his men set off with their general for the airbase, stopping when they reached a steep cliff overlooking the ravine that led to the enemy encampment. Rex examined the Umbaran defenses with a set of electrobinoculars and observed that the base was heavily guarded, with at least three tank divisions and a plethora of cannon installments contributing to its fortifications.\n\nKrell decided that they would besiege the airbase in another full forward assault, as they had without success against the capital's defenses. As Rex pointed out, the narrow ravine would force them into single squads, which would make them easy targets for enemy fire. Although Rex recommended that they look for a more secure route, Krell decreed that they did not have time to do so because Kenobi was urgently depending on their success. Despite again disagreeing, Rex heeded his orders. While 501st Sergeant CC-1119, nicknamed \"Appo,\" remained with Krell, Rex gathered his men at the bottom of the cliff and organized them into two divisions, one that he would personally lead and another that Fives and Hardcase would oversee. Many of the troops\u2014including Jesse, Kix, Tup, and Fives\u2014objected to Krell's tactics, and though Rex tried to defend Krell's recklessness by citing Skywalker's similar traits, Fives remained opposed to their interim general's decisions. Taking Fives aside, Rex tried to convince his comrade to ease the others' minds. When Fives argued that Krell's plan was too costly and not worth following, Rex reminded him that their duty was to follow orders, even if that meant sacrificing their lives for victory.",

        "content": "# Rex - The shadows of Umbara[]\n\nLed by clone trooper pilot Odd Ball, who had been spared from General Krell's assault, the Y-wing bombers dropped munitions on the ridge, eliminating all of the Umbarans there. Shortly thereafter, Krell himself landed at Skywalker's position aboard a gunship to deliver new orders: In response to a request from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Jedi High Council had ordered Skywalker back to Coruscant without delay. In the interim, Krell would assume command of the 501st Legion for the campaign on Umbara. Skywalker was concerned about leaving his troops in the middle of the battle, but Rex assured him that they would have the Umbaran capital under Republic control by the time he returned. Before departing aboard the gunship that had dropped off Krell, Skywalker introduced Rex to Krell, speaking highly of his captain. Although Rex told Krell that it was an honor to serve with him, as the Jedi Master had amassed an impressive record of victories throughout the war, Krell\u2014a hard leader who strictly observed protocol\u2014dismissed his words as mere flattery and made it clear that his command style was of a much different temperament than that of Skywalker. Despite recognizing that Krell would be difficult to work with, Rex readied his men to move out with their new general for the capital.\n\nWhile on an overland march through the hills, Rex and his men were attacked by a trio of flying banshees and raised their blasters in defense. They were unable to kill the banshees, which each grabbed a trooper and carried them into the air; only Krell's intervention stopped the creatures' rampage and saved their clone victims. Krell did not sympathize with the troops' plight and briskly led them onward. Rex and his men trekked across the rough terrain for twelve hours straight, with Kix, the unit medic, soon voicing concerns for the soldiers' increasing fatigue. Although Rex suggested to Krell that they make camp on a nearby ridge, Krell asserted the necessity of taking the capital as swiftly as possible\u2014to him, the clones' comfort was not as important as completing their mission, since the other Republic battalions were relying on their success. They eventually reached the main road leading to the capital, at which point Rex and Krell met to resolve their plan of attack.\n\nRather than utilizing Skywalker's original plan for a myriad of surgical strikes, Krell opted to pit the entirety of the 501st platoons against the city's defenses in a full frontal assault\u2014a plan that Rex saw as misguided, as it would surely engender high casualties. Despite Rex's concerns that they did not know the extent of the Umbaran defenses, Krell refused to let his orders be questioned and directed the captain to lead the 501st toward the capital, explicitly instructing him to continue marching regardless of Umbaran resistance. Rex reluctantly obeyed Krell's command and led the 501st platoons and AT-RT walkers on the route to the city, while Krell remained behind to command them from a distance. Tup and Fives saw the plan as reckless, but though Rex acknowledged that he, too, disagreed with Krell's strategy, he focused his men on staying alert on the battlefield. They soon encountered mines that had been planted along the road, and Ringo and Oz died in the detonations. While everyone else laid low, Rex had Fives execute a sensor sweep of the road ahead to root out any more waiting mines.",

        "content": "# Rex - Against General Krell[]\n\nThe 501st Legion established a staging area at the Umbaran airbase, making use of its barracks and attempting to crack the Umbaran starfighter access codes so that they could be converted for Republic use. However, the capture of the base had come at high casualties, further sowing mistrust with Krell's leadership within the 501st ranks. Furthermore, Rex and Krell soon discovered from Kenobi that the seizure of the airbase had not, ultimately, severed the capital's supply lines as they had hoped. Holographically conferring with Kenobi at the airbase's command center, Rex and Krell learned that the Umbarans had begun to receive arms shipments from a Separatist supply ship in orbit. With that new source, the Umbarans were continuing long-range missile attacks on Kenobi's position, preventing him from reaching the capital. When Rex inquired after the possibility of destroying the orbital supply ship, Kenobi stated that they had been unable to do so thus far due to the Separatist fleet's greater strength, leading Krell to resolve to take the capital regardless of the threat of the missiles. Before Kenobi could respond, the connection was severed due to enemy interference. Proceeding to ground level, Krell ordered that the 501st Legion be ready to move out in twelve hours for an assault on the capital, ignoring Rex's concerns that they should coordinate their attack with Kenobi's battalion even as the Umbaran missile strikes targeted an area adjacent to the airbase.\n\nRex joined his men in Hangar 9-4, where the clones were working to break the starfighter access codes. Upon learning of Krell's decision to continue the push toward the capital, Fives, Jesse, and Tup were disgusted with their general's head-on tactics. Rex did not agree with Krell's plan either but could not think of a better option to suggest to him. Fives solved that dilemma when he revealed that Jesse had cracked the starfighter access codes\u2014they now had the ability to infiltrate the Separatist blockade as friendlies and eliminate the supply ship. Rex took Fives' proposal to Krell, who\u2014obstinate as ever\u2014dismissed it out of a lack of faith in the clone troopers' ability to pilot the alien-designed starfighters, in spite of Rex's belief in his men's faculty for adaptivity. When Rex broke the news to Hardcase, Tup, Jesse, and Fives in the barracks, Fives proposed that they carry on with their illegal plan and accept the consequences, which would, at the very least, involve being court-martialed. Although he stated that he would have given the strategy his support if they had more time and training, Rex resolved that they lacked both. He continued to argue with Fives outside of the barracks, seeing his comrade's intention to disobey orders as bereft of honor.\n\nUnable to convince Rex that Krell's orders were not worth following, Fives stubbornly left to round up some volunteers for the mission. He recruited Jesse and Hardcase as pilots for the Umbaran starfighters, but they drew Krell's attention when Hardcase accidentally liquidated the door of Hangar 9-4 while test-piloting one of the starfighters. Although Fives and Hardcase managed to convince Krell that the incident was a result of an enemy booby trap encoded in the starfighter, Krell simply cited it to Rex and Fives as further reason that the craft were too dangerous for their use. Krell consequently grounded the fighters, leaving Rex exasperated with Fives and Hardcase's actions. That night, while leading a full perimeter sweep to patrol for enemy activity in the outlying forest, Rex was sought out by Fives, Hardcase, and Jesse, who revealed that they were going to attack the supply ship in spite of the consequences for disobedience. When Fives asked him if he intended to stop them, Rex resignedly replied that he would not be able to help them when they got caught. After returning to the airbase, Rex witnessed the trio's launch from the hangar bay, and Krell thereafter confronted him about the illegal launch. Covering for his men, Rex claimed that he had authorized their launch so that they could reconnoiter the delta in preparation for the march on the capital, promising a full report to Krell once his men returned.\n\nHaving concealed Fives' plan from Krell, Rex was next challenged by Dogma and Tup, who sought to report their comrades to avoid being found complicit in their insubordination. Rex intercepted the two young troopers and managed to turn them away before they could speak with Krell, forcing them to go through him before they approached the general. Eventually, Rex witnessed with Tup a massive explosion through the clouds overhead, and he realized that Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase had destroyed the supply ship. When only Fives and Jesse returned, Rex learned that Hardcase had sacrificed himself to eliminate the orbital transport. They were then interrupted by Sergeant Appo, who reported that Krell had summoned them to the command tower. Standing before the general, Rex attempted to claim responsibility for his men's actions, but Fives insisted that he be punished instead, since he had committed the offense. Krell, caring little for the Advanced Recon Commando's display of honor, proclaimed that they would be court-martialed, for he brooked no insubordination among his troops. While Fives and Jesse were stripped of their weaponry and locked in the airbase's brig, Rex tried to convince Krell against court-martialing them. Krell came to agree with him, but not for the same reasons\u2014believing that Fives and Jesse were defective, and convinced of the need to set an example for the rest of the men, he decided that the pair's punishment would instead be execution.\n\nKrell ordered Rex to immediately prepare a firing squad for the execution, leaving the captain shocked with his orders. He and several other clone troopers reluctantly went to retrieve Fives and Jesse from the prison levels. Although the two soldiers were disgusted when they learned of their punishment, they resigned to their fates and did not bear Rex blame for Krell's decision. Locked in binders, Fives and Jesse were brought outside for the execution, to be delivered by a firing squad that included Kix and Tup. However, when Dogma gave the order to fire, Kix, Tup, and their comrades could not bring themselves to shoot at their own brothers and misfired, instead perforating the wall behind them. Although Dogma insisted that they follow Krell's orders, Rex overrode him, having realized that Fives and Jesse did not deserve to be executed for their insubordinate yet heroic actions. While everyone save for Dogma stood with him, Rex had Fives and Jesse freed from their binders, telling Dogma that he would have little success with finding others to conduct the execution.\n\nKrell called Rex and Dogma back to the command tower, where they faced his extreme displeasure at their disobedience. Rex stood up to Krell a second time, meeting his threats for retribution with stoic determination of his own. Their standoff was interrupted by an incoming transmission from trooper Waxer of Cody's 212th Attack Battalion, who, like Rex, was a veteran of the Battle of Ryloth and the Second Battle of Geonosis. Rex was unaware that the message had been forged. Waxer alleged that the Umbarans had ambushed a clone platoon and had pilfered weapons and armor, warning that they could be gearing up for a devastating attack. Postponing Jesse and Fives' punishment and ordering them back to confinement, Krell had Rex mobilize his men to preempt the Umbarans with a preliminary strike, making a point to warn the clones not to be confused by the enemies' armor. Rex then set off with Tup, Dogma, and a forward platoon into the briar fens of the forest.\n\nRex's platoon was soon assaulted by enemy forces, though the shrouded environment prevented them from identifying their attackers. He sent his men forward with mortar launchers, and they bombarded the enemy lines with artillery rounds. Kix, using his night vision filters, saw that the opposing soldiers were wearing 212th armor and concluded that they were disguised Umbarans, just as Krell had cautioned. The ensuing battle saw both the 501st and their enemies sustain scores of casualties. Yet as Rex was to soon discover, the attacking soldiers were not Umbarans. While heading through the battlefield, he noticed a fallen enemy soldier in a nearby grove and removed the trooper's helmet to verify his identity. To his abject horror, the face underneath was not Umbaran, but that of another clone trooper. Distraught, Rex ran out onto the battlefield, frantically ordering his men to cease their fire and take off their helmets to show that they were not enemies. He took the risk of doing so himself to halt the rising carnage, even tackling one of the enemy soldiers and removing the trooper's helmet to further show both sides that all of them were clones, none of them enemies. The 212th-marked soldiers took off their helmets as well, equally aghast that they had attacked their brethren from the 501st.\n\nAs the hostilities dissolved into shock about the wrongful massacre, the 501st and the 212th tended to the many wounded and fallen. While a distressed Tup and Dogma questioned why their fellow soldiers had attacked them, Kix sought out Rex and reported that he had found Waxer, who had served as the platoon leader from the 212th and would surely have some answers to their questions. Kix led Rex and Dogma to Waxer, who was on the brink of death, being tended to by another 212th trooper. Removing his fellow veteran's helmet, Rex spoke face-to-face with the ailing Waxer and asked him who had ordered the 212th to attack the 501st. With his final breaths, Waxer revealed that Krell was responsible. The general had supplied the coordinates to assault alleged enemy forces who, they had been told, were disguised in clone trooper armor. While Waxer died, Rex\u2014having long suspected that Krell's recklessness was rooted in darkness\u2014realized that Krell was, in fact, a traitor to the Republic, and he resolved to arrest their general on charges of treason. Gathering the 501st and 212th survivors, Rex told them of his intentions and mobilized them to bring Krell to justice. Knowing that what he proposed was highly treasonous, he gave his troops the option to opt out, though all of them decided to stand by him.\n\nLeading his men back to the airbase, Rex first stopped by the prison block with Kix and Tup to release and rearm Fives and Jesse, who fell in line with the others. They all proceeded to the command tower, where they stormed into the control room and surrounded Krell, training their blasters on him. Rex informed Krell that he was being relieved of duty and demanded his surrender, though Krell responded by proclaiming the clones' inferiority and releasing a massive Force pulse against his would-be captors. Krell activated his double-bladed lightsabers and used them to great effect, cutting through many of the soldiers in a matter of moments. Rex himself narrowly avoided being hit by a corpse that Krell kicked in his direction. Refusing to let Rex and the clone troopers undermine him, Krell broke out of the command tower, smashing through the viewing window and forcing his way through the troops who confronted him below. By the time Rex made it to ground level with Jesse, Fives, and the others, Krell had escaped into the forest, leaving behind a long trail of carnage. Before they could pursue, Rex and his comrades were challenged by Dogma, who tried to retain his loyalties to his general, proclaiming that all of the clone troopers were traitors for turning on Krell.\n\nDogma raised his blaster at his fellow troopers, who did the same to him, but Dogma's uncertainty with his own position grew when Rex told him that they were not mindless, obedient soldiers\u2014they were more than droids, and they had a duty to make their own decisions when faced with ill-natured orders. Dogma hesitated, then lowered his blaster, and several other troopers subdued him. Ordering that Dogma be taken to the prison block, Rex led the remainder of his men into the jungle after Krell, splitting them into groups to search for their rogue general. After a while, Rex checked with the other squads to see if anyone had found any sign of Krell. One of the other units had encountered him, and Fives spotted them up ahead, but all of them fell to Krell's blades. Approaching Rex and his squad, Krell jumped into the trees and used the Force to magnify his voice, taunting the clone troopers and their loyalty to him. Krell then revealed himself and attacked, dealing a great number of losses. While Rex tried to hold the line with Fives and their rapidly diminishing troops, he was contacted via comlink by Tup, who had a plan to defeat Krell that required the general being lured toward him. Rex observed Tup's request to trust him and ordered everyone to circle around Krell and lead him in Tup's direction. They soon saw Tup's idea: to maneuver Krell into the waiting tentacles of a ravenous vixus, a threat that even the Jedi Master did not expect to encounter.\n\nTup succeeded, and although the hungry creature did not digest Krell, he was left winded upon breaking free of its tentacles. Tup killed the vixus and stunned Krell at point-blank range, and Rex congratulated the rookie trooper on his canniness. Locked in a set of binders, Krell was brought back to the airbase, where Rex and his men installed him in a detention cell adjacent to Dogma's. Confronting the shackled Krell, Rex discovered that the Jedi Master had fallen to the dark side. Krell had foreseen that the Jedi were going to lose the Clone Wars and strove to become Count Dooku's new apprentice, intending to curry favor with the Sith Lord by driving the Republic from Umbara. Although Rex refused to let Krell's ambitious plans come to fruition, the Jedi Master believed that the Umbarans would soon retake the airbase, at which point the Separatists would set him free. Troubled by their deposed general's resolve, Rex, Fives, Jesse, and Tup returned to ground level, where they witnessed bombings overhead from the Umbarans' long-range missiles. Appo reported to Rex that the command center's transmitter had been repaired, as it had been offline not due to enemy interference, but because of sabotage. Appo went on to convey that Kenobi's forces had conquered the capital city, though the remaining Umbarans were now regrouping to retake the airbase. Rex ordered Appo to mobilize all of their men on the perimeter in preparation for what looked to be a full-scale enemy assault.\n\nRex realized that Krell, having sabotaged the transmitter, had been against the clone troopers from the beginning, leading Fives to conclude that if the Umbarans took custody of Krell, he would betray all of the Republic intelligence in his possession. Jesse and Tup agreed that they had to do something to silence Krell, and Rex reluctantly conceded that they would have to execute him. The captain returned to the prison block with Fives and Jesse to carry out the task at hand. While Fives brought Dogma out of his cell, Rex told Krell to turn around and step toward the back wall, then ordered him onto his knees. He drew one of his blaster pistols and had Jesse deactivate the shielded door of Krell's cell. Despite the necessity of executing the Jedi Master to prevent his information from falling into Separatist hands, Rex hesitated with killing an unarmed Jedi, even in spite of his crimes against the 501st and the 212th. Krell sensed his hesitation and savored his fear, calling out the captain on his inability to deliver the killing shot. In the end, the fatal shot came not from Rex, but from Dogma, who had lifted one of Fives' blaster pistols. Having been one of Krell's most ardent supporters, Dogma had consequently been devastated by his betrayal.\n\nTheir general permanently removed from duty, Rex and the others exited from the detention level. Republic LAAT/i gunships soon landed at the airbase, and Dogma was taken away on one of them, exchanging a respectful nod with Rex before leaving. Fives informed Rex that Kenobi's battalions had routed the final Umbaran holdouts\u2014the Battle of Umbara was over, and the Republic was now in control of the Shadow World. With the hostilities abated, Rex wondered aloud why they were fighting the war and what would happen to the clone troopers when it ended. Fives, Jesse, Tup, and the others did not have an answer for him, and they simply watched as Dogma's gunship lifted off into the darkened Umbara sky. Following the campaign, Rex reported to his superiors on Krell's treason against the Republic and his betrayal of the Jedi Order, though responsibility for his execution remained with the arrested Dogma.\n\n",

They used their ascension cables to climb the cliffs to the monastery under fire from two droid battalions. Rex and his men secured the monastery. After Skywalker and Tano found Jabba's son, Separatist vulture droids attacked as two Separatist landing craft deployed more battle droids under the command of Ventress. Rex and his men retreated into the monastery.\n\nRex and his men stayed behind to keep the battle droids busy. After Ventress cut the door's lock, Rex and his men fought the droids, but the droids subdued his men. Rex picked up his pistol and tried to shoot Ventress, who disarmed and Force-choked him, demanding the location of Skywalker. Rex refused, but Ventress tried to use a mind trick to make him contact Skywalker. However, Rex managed to resist the mental attack and, upon contacting his general, chose to break protocol by calling Skywalker by his first name, resulting in Skywalker realizing that Ventress was coming.\n\nAfter the clone captain and his surviving troops were taken to the courtyard, Skywalker contacted Rex, so a battle droid came over to investigate. Rex punched the unit and took its weapon. Rex and his troops then fought the droids guarding them. As they were surrounded, help arrived from Kenobi and Cody. After destroying a spider droid with a detonator, Rex told Skywalker they could take care of themselves and that the mission came first. Rex then went with Kenobi, Yoda, and Cody to pick up Skywalker and his apprentice from Jabba's Palace on Tatooine.\n\n",

Their mission: rescue Master Piell from the impregnable prison, the Citadel, before Piell is force to give up the information on the Nexus Routes. Cody and the rest of the team then went down to the temple's hangar. There Cody and the team were frozen in carbonite in order to avoid sensors. When Cody and the team got past Lola Sayu's blockade, they were thawed out by Artoo. When Cody, Kenobi, and Skywalker went to look at their way in, they saw that the jet packs and ascension cables were ruled out because of the wind and mines on the cliff's face. So Cody and the team had to free climb it. Unfortunately, one of the troopers, Charger fell onto one of the mines while climbing it, alerting the Citadel's warden Commander Osi Sobeck to their presence. Cody and the team make their way through the halls of the Citadel, but encountered booby traps which killed another of their troopers, Longshot. Cody and the team then found and saved Master Piell before the interrogator droid takes out his good eye. After Piell told the team that his Captain has the other half of the Nexus Route, Cody and the team then make their way down to where he is being held. Cody and the team then ran into commando droids. Cody and the team were able to deal with the first of the commando droids. Sobeck then activated magnets in the ceiling which took everyone's weapons and Skywalker arm from them. When Kenobi and Piell used the force to hold back the commando droids, cody, rex and their men took them head on,but to no avail. Fortunately, Skywalker was able to turn off the magnets and gave everyone their weapons. Cody and the team reached where Piell's Captain, Wilhuff Tarkin and the other officers were being held. Kenobi and Skywalker then decide, in order to protect the information, to split up with Rex, ARC Troopers Echo, Fives, Skywalker and Ahsoka taking Tarkin while Cody and Kenobi took Piell with them. As Kenobi's team escaped, Cody and one of his troopers planted explosives along the way. Kenobi then set them off and Cody and the team made their escape. During their escape they met up with Skywalker's team and Arc Trooper Echo, was killed. The ship they were going to escape in was also destroyed. Cody and team then contacted the jedi council, who sent master Plo Koon to rescue them at an island in the middle of a lava pit. On their way there Master Even Piell was killed during a firefight with droids. The rest of the survivors climbed aboard Master Plo's gunship and made it away safely.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Against General Krell[]\n\nHaving concealed Fives' plan from Krell, Rex was next challenged by Dogma and Tup, who sought to report their comrades to avoid being found complicit in their insubordination. Rex intercepted the two young troopers and managed to turn them away before they could speak with Krell, forcing them to go through him before they approached the general. Eventually, Rex witnessed with Tup a massive explosion through the clouds overhead, and he realized that Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase had destroyed the supply ship. When only Fives and Jesse returned, Rex learned that Hardcase had sacrificed himself to eliminate the orbital transport. They were then interrupted by Sergeant Appo, who reported that Krell had summoned them to the command tower. Standing before the general, Rex attempted to claim responsibility for his men's actions, but Fives insisted that he be punished instead, since he had committed the offense. Krell, caring little for the Advanced Recon Commando's display of honor, proclaimed that they would be court-martialed, for he brooked no insubordination among his troops. While Fives and Jesse were stripped of their weaponry and locked in the airbase's brig, Rex tried to convince Krell against court-martialing them. Krell came to agree with him, but not for the same reasons\u2014believing that Fives and Jesse were defective, and convinced of the need to set an example for the rest of the men, he decided that the pair's punishment would instead be execution.\n\nKrell ordered Rex to immediately prepare a firing squad for the execution, leaving the captain shocked with his orders. He and several other clone troopers reluctantly went to retrieve Fives and Jesse from the prison levels. Although the two soldiers were disgusted when they learned of their punishment, they resigned to their fates and did not bear Rex blame for Krell's decision. Locked in binders, Fives and Jesse were brought outside for the execution, to be delivered by a firing squad that included Kix and Tup. However, when Dogma gave the order to fire, Kix, Tup, and their comrades could not bring themselves to shoot at their own brothers and misfired, instead perforating the wall behind them. Although Dogma insisted that they follow Krell's orders, Rex overrode him, having realized that Fives and Jesse did not deserve to be executed for their insubordinate yet heroic actions. While everyone save for Dogma stood with him, Rex had Fives and Jesse freed from their binders, telling Dogma that he would have little success with finding others to conduct the execution.\n\nKrell called Rex and Dogma back to the command tower, where they faced his extreme displeasure at their disobedience. Rex stood up to Krell a second time, meeting his threats for retribution with stoic determination of his own. Their standoff was interrupted by an incoming transmission from trooper Waxer of Cody's 212th Attack Battalion, who, like Rex, was a veteran of the Battle of Ryloth and the Second Battle of Geonosis. Rex was unaware that the message had been forged. Waxer alleged that the Umbarans had ambushed a clone platoon and had pilfered weapons and armor, warning that they could be gearing up for a devastating attack. Postponing Jesse and Fives' punishment and ordering them back to confinement, Krell had Rex mobilize his men to preempt the Umbarans with a preliminary strike, making a point to warn the clones not to be confused by the enemies' armor. Rex then set off with Tup, Dogma, and a forward platoon into the briar fens of the forest.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett\n\nIn February, 2017, a Star Wars fan asked Dawson on Twitter if she would ever play Ahsoka Tano, and she replied that she would want to play her, causing fans to be excited about Tano appearing in live-action. According to Dawson, someone at Lucasfilm forwarded the Tweet to The Mandalorian executive producer Dave Filoni, and he thought she would make a good Ahsoka Tano. Filoni and Star Wars then followed Dawson on Twitter, but nothing happened for a long time. Filoni kept loosely aware of Dawson's Marvel career and he watched interviews of her expressing excitement for the role. When Dawson and Filoni discussed the show, he revisited Dawson's casting and realized Dawson's age would fit Tano's age in the show, and he decided the casting was feasible. Filoni and The Mandalorian creator and executive producer Jon Favreau did not want to include Tano in Season One because Filoni did not want to mess up Tano's portrayal.\n\nDuring early production of Season One, Favreau told Filoni that the Child's name would be Grogu, prompting Filoni to think of ways the audience could learn his name. He thought that Tano could learn Grogu's name by communicating through memories and experiences, and she could tell this to the Mandalorian and the audience. Filoni and Favreau knew they wanted Tano in the second season's story, so they started visualizing Dawson in the role, and art of the actress playing Tano was created. After they showed that art to Dawson, they asked if she would take the role and she agreed. Concept designer Brian Matyas explained that the effects team shortened Tano's lekku due to practicality reasons when performing stunts.\n\nTano appeared in the episode Chapter 13: The Jedi, which was written and directed by Filoni. According to Filoni, the episode was a test run to see how audiences would react to seeing Tano in live-action. When Filoni wrote the scene in which Tano reveals Grogu's history, he shaped it around when Obi-Wan Kenobi told Luke Skywalker about his father in A New Hope. When Filoni was working on the episode, he knew the actress who plays the Magistrate would have to be someone who can instantly challenge Tano. After being cast as Tano, Dawson watched The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, and the Star Wars saga as preparation. Dawson studied Ashley Eckstein's portrayal of Tano in animation and tried her best to honor it. Dawson was fascinated by how Tano was the center of \"this whole other world\" shown in The Clone Wars. Dawson played Tano like a wandering samurai and a knowledgeable knight. Filoni pointed to Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings as a touchpoint, and all of this factored into Dawson's portrayal. Dawson wanted to have Tano's playfulness and fun, including her cocky eyebrow. She liked Tano's wisdom and how she is grounded after everything she has gone through. Dawson enjoyed having homages to the different aspects of Tano. Filoni talked about classic samurai films such as Yojimbo, and he described Tano as someone wandering the galaxy helping people in need.\n\nMany screen tests were done because the Volume tends to look magenta. Everything in Tano's costume was considered to an intense degree, including her headtails and horns. Filoni wanted Tano's facial markings to be subtle and look very natural instead of looking like face paint in The Clone Wars. Makeup designer Brian Sipe had a difficult time finding the right look between human-realistic and pleasing to fans of The Clone Wars graphic image. The crew tried to make Tano's makeup warm and natural, as well as have a different energy compared to animation. Dawson wanted to be as authentic to the animated Tano as possible, so she insisted on wearing blue contacts to match the character's eye color. All of the prosthetics were built to Dawson's skull and body, and Tano's headband clipped in the back and held the headtails in place. The make-up artists tucked Dawson's hair away so she could wear the headpiece. The total transformation initially took three hours. Dawson thought the face markings, different skin color, and costume were incredible, but she did not feel like Tano until she put the contacts in. The crew had to worry about the Volume's temperature changing Tano's skin color, so small considerations were made and adjusted.",

        "content": "# Rex - The shadows of Umbara[]\n\nIn late 21 BBY, a major point of contention in the war became the planet Umbara, whose Umbaran people had recently seceded from the Republic and were arming the Confederacy with their extremely advanced military weaponry. The Republic responded to Umbara's defection by sending a full invasion force from the Grand Army to conquer the strategic Umbara system, which was located in the Expansion Region's remote Ghost Nebula. As part of the numerous units dispatched to Umbara, Rex and the 501st Legion joined Skywalker and Kenobi aboard one of the Republic fleet's lead Acclamator-class transports. After Tano and Barriss Offee breached the Separatist blockade of Umbara, Skywalker and Kenobi's assault ship moved in on the Shadow World, so named because the Ghost Nebula eternally shrouded it in night. While their troops prepared to land on Umbara, Skywalker and Kenobi held a briefing in the hangar bay with Rex, Cody, and other troopers to outline the plan for capturing the capital city. Jedi Generals Saesee Tiin and Pong Krell would be supporting Kenobi and Cody's battle group in their attack on the Umbaran capital from the south, while Rex, Skywalker, and the 501st Legion were tasked with intercepting enemy reinforcements to the north of the city. Opposing the Republic forces would be the heavily armed Umbaran Soldiers of the Umbaran militia.\n\nRex was pleased to learn that he and Skywalker would be assisted by an old friend, Advanced Recon Commando Fives, who was on special assignment to the 501st for the campaign. Once all of the Republic forces were ready for deployment, the Jedi and clones began their landing, taking space gunships to the planetary surface. Lieutenant Hawk piloted Rex, Skywalker, Fives, and some of the 501st troops\u2014including veterans Hardcase and Jesse and new generation recruits Dogma and CT-5385, nicknamed \"Tup\"\u2014through the atmosphere's thick fog, with clone Z-95 starfighters providing support against enemy Umbaran starfighters. When the gunships were met with dense surface cannon-fire from the Umbaran militia, Hawk struggled to reach the predetermined landing site through the difficult conditions. After All Terrain Recon Transports and 501st AT-RT drivers were deployed to secure the landing zone against approaching Umbaran Soldiers and Umbaran hover tanks, Hawk brought Rex, Skywalker, and their men to the drop site, where they joined the battle and led the 501st Legion's charge on the Umbaran lines. During their advance, Rex took notice of a nearby ridge, which Skywalker elected to claim for use as a staging area.\n\nThe Umbarans and their hover tanks were relentless in defending their positions, and Umbaran starfighters proved an even greater danger, executing strafing runs on the 501st troops. Even with the added threat of an esurient vixus creature, Rex and his men prevailed, taking the ridge and converting it into a temporary post. While monitoring the ongoing battle's progress from the trenches along the ridge, Skywalker noted that Kenobi's battalion was nearing the capital. However, the interlude in fighting did not last long, as Umbaran Soldiers had infiltrated the thick foliage behind the 501st lines to catch them off-guard. One of the enemy soldiers released a small but lethal millicreep droid, and the Umbarans took advantage of the clones' following distraction to ambush them. In the ensuing engagement, Skywalker cut through the millicreep, while Rex called in an airstrike on the enemy's position. Seeing an opening to the south of the ridge, Rex advised that they move their men off the ridge in case the airstrike overshot, and Skywalker heeded his captain's advice. While Skywalker defended their flank, Rex led the 501st platoons out of the trenches to take cover amidst the scattered vegetation just below the hill. They were glad that they had done so, for a pair of BTL-B Y-wing starfighters arrived only moments later.\n\nLed by clone trooper pilot Odd Ball, who had been spared from General Krell's assault, the Y-wing bombers dropped munitions on the ridge, eliminating all of the Umbarans there. Shortly thereafter, Krell himself landed at Skywalker's position aboard a gunship to deliver new orders: In response to a request from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Jedi High Council had ordered Skywalker back to Coruscant without delay. In the interim, Krell would assume command of the 501st Legion for the campaign on Umbara. Skywalker was concerned about leaving his troops in the middle of the battle, but Rex assured him that they would have the Umbaran capital under Republic control by the time he returned. Before departing aboard the gunship that had dropped off Krell, Skywalker introduced Rex to Krell, speaking highly of his captain. Although Rex told Krell that it was an honor to serve with him, as the Jedi Master had amassed an impressive record of victories throughout the war, Krell\u2014a hard leader who strictly observed protocol\u2014dismissed his words as mere flattery and made it clear that his command style was of a much different temperament than that of Skywalker. Despite recognizing that Krell would be difficult to work with, Rex readied his men to move out with their new general for the capital.\n\nWhile on an overland march through the hills, Rex and his men were attacked by a trio of flying banshees and raised their blasters in defense. They were unable to kill the banshees, which each grabbed a trooper and carried them into the air; only Krell's intervention stopped the creatures' rampage and saved their clone victims. Krell did not sympathize with the troops' plight and briskly led them onward. Rex and his men trekked across the rough terrain for twelve hours straight, with Kix, the unit medic, soon voicing concerns for the soldiers' increasing fatigue. Although Rex suggested to Krell that they make camp on a nearby ridge, Krell asserted the necessity of taking the capital as swiftly as possible\u2014to him, the clones' comfort was not as important as completing their mission, since the other Republic battalions were relying on their success. They eventually reached the main road leading to the capital, at which point Rex and Krell met to resolve their plan of attack.\n\nRather than utilizing Skywalker's original plan for a myriad of surgical strikes, Krell opted to pit the entirety of the 501st platoons against the city's defenses in a full frontal assault\u2014a plan that Rex saw as misguided, as it would surely engender high casualties. Despite Rex's concerns that they did not know the extent of the Umbaran defenses, Krell refused to let his orders be questioned and directed the captain to lead the 501st toward the capital, explicitly instructing him to continue marching regardless of Umbaran resistance. Rex reluctantly obeyed Krell's command and led the 501st platoons and AT-RT walkers on the route to the city, while Krell remained behind to command them from a distance. Tup and Fives saw the plan as reckless, but though Rex acknowledged that he, too, disagreed with Krell's strategy, he focused his men on staying alert on the battlefield. They soon encountered mines that had been planted along the road, and Ringo and Oz died in the detonations. While everyone else laid low, Rex had Fives execute a sensor sweep of the road ahead to root out any more waiting mines.\n\nThere were indeed more explosives, and Rex and his men were careful to avoid setting them off. However, Umbaran Soldiers subsequently ambushed them from the surrounding forest. In spite of lacking cover from the Umbarans, Rex ordered his men to maintain their position on the road. He took out several Umbarans himself, but the 501st's casualties mounted as the enemy advanced on them, attacking from all sides. With his men surrounded, Rex ordered a retreat so that they could draw the Umbarans out of the darkened jungle. Although the 501st's rear flank endured heavy losses, Rex's plan worked, and his platoons were able to return many of the casualties to the Umbarans, forcing them to abandon their pursuit. Immediately thereafter, Rex was confronted by a greatly displeased Krell, who was outraged that the captain's retreat had ceded control of the road to the Umbarans. Fives protested to Krell's accusations, only to have his defiance silenced when Krell ignited one of his lightsabers and ordered him to stand down. Yet Rex stood his ground, stating that he had followed Krell's orders and, as a result, had lost many men, whose well-being it was his duty to defend. Noting Rex's opinion, Krell acquiesced, deactivating his lightsaber and dismissing him, though Rex and Fives were unable to ascertain if the general's words had been meant as a compliment. The Umbarans had meanwhile regrouped and resumed their assault, and Rex mobilized his men to defend their position.\n\nUpon entering the jungle to combat the Umbarans, Rex and the 501st Legion were faced with the further threat of Umbaran starfighters, whose ray shields effectively repelled their blasterfire. One of the starfighters moved in low to strafe them, and Rex and his men were unable to shoot it down before it pulled out of the vegetation. Rex elected to press toward the Umbaran lines before more starfighters could assail them. When Kix called for support to save some of the wounded, Rex led his men forward to cover Kix's position, having Jesse protect their right flank and Dogma their left. Kix rescued several of the fallen troopers and administered temporary stimulants until they could receive proper medical treatment. In the midst of the fighting, Krell received word that Kenobi was unable to secure the capital due to its overpowering defenses, which were being resupplied by an Umbaran airbase to the west of the city. Before his battalion could advance on the capital, Kenobi required the 501st to capture the airbase so that the city's supply lines would be severed. Krell obliged, and Rex and his men set off with their general for the airbase, stopping when they reached a steep cliff overlooking the ravine that led to the enemy encampment. Rex examined the Umbaran defenses with a set of electrobinoculars and observed that the base was heavily guarded, with at least three tank divisions and a plethora of cannon installments contributing to its fortifications.\n\nKrell decided that they would besiege the airbase in another full forward assault, as they had without success against the capital's defenses. As Rex pointed out, the narrow ravine would force them into single squads, which would make them easy targets for enemy fire. Although Rex recommended that they look for a more secure route, Krell decreed that they did not have time to do so because Kenobi was urgently depending on their success. Despite again disagreeing, Rex heeded his orders. While 501st Sergeant CC-1119, nicknamed \"Appo,\" remained with Krell, Rex gathered his men at the bottom of the cliff and organized them into two divisions, one that he would personally lead and another that Fives and Hardcase would oversee. Many of the troops\u2014including Jesse, Kix, Tup, and Fives\u2014objected to Krell's tactics, and though Rex tried to defend Krell's recklessness by citing Skywalker's similar traits, Fives remained opposed to their interim general's decisions. Taking Fives aside, Rex tried to convince his comrade to ease the others' minds. When Fives argued that Krell's plan was too costly and not worth following, Rex reminded him that their duty was to follow orders, even if that meant sacrificing their lives for victory.\n\nRex led his men into the canyon and, after stopping to survey the airbase's defenses one last time with Hardcase and Fives, split the 501st squads into the two groups. While Rex and his team marched along the outskirts of the canyon, Fives took his division through the other side of the gorge. Fives' detachment was the first to meet Umbaran resistance in the form of an Impeding Assault Tank, a deadly crawler tank that burrowed out of the ground to ambush them. As several of the ray-shielded tanks surrounded them, Fives requested rocket launcher support from Rex, who sent one of his men forward with an RPS-6 launcher. When another Impeding Assault Tank injured that soldier, Kix tended to the fallen trooper while Hardcase took up the rocket launcher. By firing a missile directly into the cockpit of one of the tanks, Hardcase set off a chain reaction that blew apart the vehicle. However, with four more Impending Assault Tanks still operational, Rex ordered his men to regroup and take cover from the mechanical monstrosities. With only a few seconds' lead over the tanks, Rex had his troops plant thermal detonators along the ravine corridor through which the tanks were advancing. The soldiers then retreated into the bottleneck, luring the crawlers into the booby-trapped passage.\n\nOnce the tanks had fallen into their trap, Rex detonated the explosives, and he was blown into the air from the resulting blast, which consumed the four tanks. He and his men continued on in a single group, making their way through the seared wreckage of the tanks, one of which was still active. At Rex's word, Hardcase blasted its cockpit apart with a missile, and Rex made quick work of its Umbaran pilot. The clones also cut through several banshees that had been picking at some of their slain comrades, though Rex had to order Kix to leave behind the fallen and move on. As they neared the airbase, Rex and his men halted when they felt the ground shudder from doubtlessly more Umbaran forces. Sure enough, when Rex surveyed the area ahead with electrobinoculars, he saw that a far more deadly threat had been unleashed upon them: titanic six-legged juggernauts known as Umbaran mobile heavy cannons, each fitted with a powerful electromagnetic plasma cannon. He hurriedly ordered his men to fall back as the mobile heavy cannons opened fire, but the 501st platoons suffered severe casualties. Despite soliciting reinforcements from Krell, Rex was told that the rest of the 501st was guarding the entrance to the gorge so that his men could press forward to the airbase.\n\nForced to obey Krell's direct order to stand his ground against the cannons, Rex mobilized his men, directing Kix to keep the wounded as quiet as possible. Although Fives and Jesse objected to Krell's head-on plan, neither of them had any ideas for an alternative strategy, so they fell in line with Rex in spite of their misgivings. Their RPS-6 launchers proved ineffective against the mobile cannons' armor, and the 501st troops continued to endure egregious losses. In the tumult, Kix called out for help with getting the wounded to safety, and Rex helped him carry one of the injured troopers to cover in nearby vegetation. When Kix made to rescue more of the wounded and resented Rex's orders for the contrary, Rex told Kix that he needed to survive the current crisis to be able to administer aid later. Although Tup was losing hope that they would be able to hold out, Rex, surveying the airbase once more, had an idea about how to destroy the juggernauts. He sent Fives and Hardcase to commandeer two of the base's Umbaran starfighters, which would provide some much-needed air support. Krell was infuriated when he learned of Rex's alternative plan and ordered him to continue his frontal strike under threat of being relieved of duty. Rex did so with the intention of distracting the Umbarans long enough for Fives and Hardcase to complete their stealth incursion, placing his trust in them.\n\nRex took up an RPS-6 rocket launcher and used it against one of the tanks, to no avail. He narrowly avoided being crushed and managed to disable one juggernaut's plasma cannon with a rocket, which prompted the Umbaran pilot to advance his vehicle on Rex's position. The return of Hardcase and Fives aboard their pilfered starfighters saved him from the tank, their artillery succeeding where the rocket launchers had failed. Hardcase and Fives' success with eliminating the mobile heavy cannons elicited cheers from Rex and his comrades on the ground. With the juggernauts destroyed, Krell sent Appo forward with the rest of the 501st Legion to capture the airbase, where the Umbarans were using four more juggernauts to beleaguer the Republic fleet in orbit. After setting up an outpost to the south of the airfield, Rex had the 501st move in. With the aid of a Jedi Knight, they eradicated the airfield's mobile heavy cannons along with its supply lines to the capital. The Umbaran Soldiers at the base were taken prisoner and were locked in the prison levels. While reporting their hard-won success to Krell, Rex recalled that many men had died to take the enemy facility, to which Krell dismissed the captain as myopic, replying that he had yet to understand the price of victory. None of his comrades approved of Krell's sentiment, and as the general walked away, Rex agreed with Fives that it was Krell who would never comprehend the depth of the clone troopers' sacrifices.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Campaign on Ereesus[]\n\nRex and Sergeant Coric were dispatched to review security on the agriworld Biitu, where the Biituians were repurposing Separatist battle droid scrap as raw materials to be sold to the Republic Senate. Rex and Coric brought along a detachment from Torrent Company aboard an LAAT/i gunship to the Pitor Processing Plantworks, where a disturbance had been reported, though GAR command did not provide specifics. As they approached the Plantworks, Coric voiced his disregard for war profiteers like the Biituians, though Rex admonished him for his disrespectful attitude. Upon landing, they were greeted by Pitor, the foreman in charge of operations. Pitor brushed off the report of a \"disturbance\" and took the opportunity to give Rex and his squad a tour of the large facility, which, being the largest of its kind in the Outer Rim, received huge quantities of dismembered battle droids by the day. When Rex questioned Pitor as to why his men's presence had been requested, Pitor revealed that a battle droid calling itself the Reanimator, having forged himself from the bodies of his fallen comrades, had begun to bring the scrap droids back to life. Although Rex and Coric initially had trouble believing Pitor's tale, the Reanimator\u2014an IG-100 MagnaGuard with a faulty neural processor\u2014attacked Torrent Company at that moment, forcing them to take cover. While Pitor barricaded himself in his office, Rex's men fell one by one to the Reanimator and his droid army until only Rex, Coric, and a third trooper remained.\n\nRex ordered a retreat so that they could find one of the Reanimator's weaknesses and exploit it. He and Coric helped their injured comrade to Pitor's office, where Coric forced Pitor to let them inside. As the enemy droids closed in, Rex devised a plan that would combine Pitor's skills with Coric's suicidal sense of duty. Proceeding to the roof, Rex and Pitor manned magnetic grapples that would allow Coric to pose as a clone trooper with Force powers. When the Reanimator arrived with his droids, Rex's ruse distracted the Reanimator long enough for Coric to place a blaster shot through the droid's head. The clone soldiers remained at the Plantworks for another day to eliminate the rest of the droids. Their report of the incident resulted in the Senate agreeing to implement stringent checks on all Biitu-bound salvage shipments to prevent further complications, as deliveries of still-operable battle droids had been the agent of the catastrophe. Rex, Coric, and their men received Pitor's thanks before departing. As they lifted off, Coric commented to Rex that despite his still-low opinion of profiteers like Pitor, he had learned that the only reliable battle droid was a properly recycled one.\n\nOn another assignment without Skywalker, Rex and Torrent Company traveled to the planet Ereesus in the Outer Rim, where they entered into a collaboration with the local Ereesus Planetary Security Forces to repel a Confederate invasion. After establishing a forward operating base, Rex and his soldiers initiated an assault on the droid battle group, which was being overseen by a number of T-series tactical droids. The Republic's campaign soon took a turn for the worst, as the Separatists captured a squad led by Planetary Security Forces Sergeant Palola\u2014along with their Torrent Company liaison, Oz\u2014while gaining substantial ground, threatening to collapse the 501st Legion's left flank. The same night, Rex and his men learned of the Separatists' demands for the hostage militiamen via a two-minute holographic transmission from the tactical droid who had seized the squad. Adding to Rex's growing headache were numerous rebukes from generals in Sector Command concerning the fragile and crumbling situation.",

        "content": "# Rex - Campaign on Ereesus[]\n\nRex was soon sought out at the forward base by Lieutenant Sollaw ap-Orwien and Corporal Dafyd, the former of whom asked to view the holorecording of the captive squad to see what Palola had said. Rex mistook ap-Orwien's entreaty for a misconceived notion, as the tactical droid had not allowed Palola to utter a single word during the transmission, but ap-Orwien insisted that due to being a Lorrdian like Palola, he could discern a message. As Rex brought ap-Orwien and Dafyd to the operations room, the former explained that during the Kanz Disorders of millennia prior, the Argazdan Myrialites had enslaved the Lorrdians and barred them from speaking. To the stupefaction of Rex and troopers Jesse and Ringo, ap-Orwien\u2014instantly after taking his eyes off the transmission\u2014relayed key intelligence from Palola. The Lorrdian sergeant, Oz, and their five comrades were being held in a depot at the top of the Hidaci Ridge; the tactical droid's base of operations was a granary halfway up; and the Separatists had stockpiled fuel and artillery on the road along the ridge.\n\nAp-Orwien continued his explanation of the kinetic communication that the Lorrdians had developed during the Kanz Disorders, which had allowed them to communicate via the most minuscule movements and gestures ever since. As an example, ap-Orwien left the room, with Dafyd listening in as Rex relayed some made-up tactical information to Jesse and Ringo. They were further impressed when ap-Orwien reentered and, after exchanging wordless kinetic communication with Dafyd that almost missed Rex's scrutiny, repeated the fictitious orders word-for-word. After confirming with Sector Command, Rex devised a strategy to rescue Palola's squad from the Hidaci Ridge depot. To divert the Separatists' attention, he dispatched a squadron of BTL-B Y-wing starfighters to launch a bombing run on the fuel and artillery dumps. A sham 501st advance would further draw the battle droids south and allow the extraction team's gunship to move in on the hostage site from the north. Rex selected Jesse, Ringo, and Dogma, one of their recent recruits, to accompany himself, ap-Orwien, and Dafyd on the team, with Kix serving as their medic. Rex set the plan into motion that night, deploying the starfighters to deliver their ordnance while he departed with ap-Orwien, Dafyd, and the others on a stealth-outfitted gunship.\n\nBy the light of Ereesus's moon, Rex and his comrades flew to the Hidaci Ridge and lowered cables to the surface, fast-roping from the gunship into the depot. They landed at a speeder truck loading dock, where Rex and his soldiers switched on their night vision filters while the Lorrdian militiamen strapped night vision goggles over their eyes. Once they scanned the yard for hostiles, the team used explosives to blow open the main door and proceeded into the depot. Jesse and Ringo set a second set of charges to breach another door in the facility's office, which led downstairs to where Palola had reported that he and the other captives were being held. Immediately after the explosives did their work, Rex had Dogma toss an EMP grenade down the stairwell leading into the basement to deactivate the droid forces within. Following Jesse and Ringo into the basement, Rex placed a blaster bolt through the head of a still-twitching battle droid. However, as the troopers and militiamen discovered, Dogma's electromagnetic pulse had not disabled all of the droids. While Rex and the others deactivated their night vision filters, Jesse yelled out from further down the stairs that there were still-active droid commandos. Rex rushed down the stairs in an attempt to spot the enemy droids, but in doing so, he narrowly avoided a commando that detached itself from the pipes on the ceiling and brought its vibrosword through where his head had been a moment prior.",

Rex later served as a captain and commander within the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Rex participated in many battles over the course of the Clone Wars. As the captain of the 501st, Rex served as third-in-command to Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, whose bravery and unconventionality in battle he came to share. In addition to being a close friend of Skywalker, he also became friends with Skywalker's apprentice, Ahsoka Tano. He was close with Marshal Commander Cody, with their relationship mirroring that of their respective Jedi Generals, Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom Rex was also well acquainted with. Rex and his companions often worked together during the front-line campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nThroughout his career, Rex proved to be an effective leader who truly cared for the men under his command, even as he began to doubt his own future\u2014and those of his clone brethren\u2014in the Republic. His leadership was put to the ultimate test at the Battle of Umbara, when he was forced to lead the 501st Legion under the obstinate and aggressive Jedi General Pong Krell, who was secretly a Separatist agent. Rex's experiences with Krell forced him to reappraise his rigid adherence to orders\u2014however, this had not been the first time Rex had questioned his purpose and orders. A notable example had been during the Battle of Saleucami, when he allowed the clone deserter Cut Lawquane to stay out of the war. Rex used his combat skills and training to help train local insurgents on Onderon to emancipate their world. Rex's faith in the Republic was sorely tested by events such as the framing of Tano as well as the death of his longtime friend and comrade Fives, who had gone rogue after unearthing an anti-Jedi directive known as Clone Protocol 66 that had been bred into all the Republic's clone troopers.\n\nFives's death led him to uncover his inhibitor chip, which enabled him and his longtime friend Ahsoka to escape Order 66 after the Siege of Mandalore. After living on Seelos with fellow Clone Commanders Gregor and Wolffe, Rex joined the Phoenix Cell and reunited with his old friend Tano. Rex also became a reliable ally of the Spectres rebel cell and forged enduring friendships with the Great Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice Ezra Bridger as well as the rest of the Ghost crew. During the early stages of the Rebellion, Rex would use his skills and knowledge to help advance the Rebel Alliance's cause. He was eventually promoted to the rank of commander and fought in the climactic Battle of Endor, which saw the first death of Emperor Palpatine, the redemption of his former Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, and the destruction of the second Death Star.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Ahsoka\n\nDawson continued to play Ahsoka Tano in the Ahsoka television series. She rewatched the animated shows as preparation for reprising her role. Dawson cut most of her hair, leaving enough to be hidden comfortably under her headpiece. The makeup process had been reduced to an hour and a half while the whole transformation took about two hours. The process would start at 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning. Dawson wanted to show how Tano does not get tired, so she dedicated herself to intense lightsaber and fight training as well as studying Tano's past. Dawson and Natasha Liu Bordizzo, the actress who played Sabine Wren, received wushu training from stunt coordinator Ming Qiu. Dawson showed Qiu freeze frames and clips from animated shows and asked Qiu to train her to do Tano's stunts. Qiu would say the stunts are not possible, but she showed Dawson what she could do instead. Dawson said this was the most physically demanding role of her life. She tried to show that Tano is struggling with balancing her humanity, experiences, and desires.\n\nA second season of Ahsoka was announced to be in development on January 9, 2024, with Filoni later revealing a development sketch on January 11 that depicted Tano and Wren atop a statue of the Father, a path previously braved by Baylan Skoll in the season one finale. Ahead of season two, Dawson reflected on Tano's character arc in season one and her hopes for the upcoming episodes, specifically expressing hope for \"some levity and some lightness\" and calling back to Tano's \"spunky energy\" seen in her early The Clone Wars appearances. She also noted how Filoni compares Tano's journey to that of Gandalf's arc, a story in Lord of the Rings that sees an already-powerful and experienced wizard continue to grow and adopt a more joyful personality.\n\n",

He narrowly avoided being crushed and managed to disable one juggernaut's plasma cannon with a rocket, which prompted the Umbaran pilot to advance his vehicle on Rex's position. The return of Hardcase and Fives aboard their pilfered starfighters saved him from the tank, their artillery succeeding where the rocket launchers had failed. Hardcase and Fives' success with eliminating the mobile heavy cannons elicited cheers from Rex and his comrades on the ground. With the juggernauts destroyed, Krell sent Appo forward with the rest of the 501st Legion to capture the airbase, where the Umbarans were using four more juggernauts to beleaguer the Republic fleet in orbit. After setting up an outpost to the south of the airfield, Rex had the 501st move in. With the aid of a Jedi Knight, they eradicated the airfield's mobile heavy cannons along with its supply lines to the capital. The Umbaran Soldiers at the base were taken prisoner and were locked in the prison levels. While reporting their hard-won success to Krell, Rex recalled that many men had died to take the enemy facility, to which Krell dismissed the captain as myopic, replying that he had yet to understand the price of victory. None of his comrades approved of Krell's sentiment, and as the general walked away, Rex agreed with Fives that it was Krell who would never comprehend the depth of the clone troopers' sacrifices.",

        "content": "# Rex - The shadows of Umbara[]\n\nRex led his men into the canyon and, after stopping to survey the airbase's defenses one last time with Hardcase and Fives, split the 501st squads into the two groups. While Rex and his team marched along the outskirts of the canyon, Fives took his division through the other side of the gorge. Fives' detachment was the first to meet Umbaran resistance in the form of an Impeding Assault Tank, a deadly crawler tank that burrowed out of the ground to ambush them. As several of the ray-shielded tanks surrounded them, Fives requested rocket launcher support from Rex, who sent one of his men forward with an RPS-6 launcher. When another Impeding Assault Tank injured that soldier, Kix tended to the fallen trooper while Hardcase took up the rocket launcher. By firing a missile directly into the cockpit of one of the tanks, Hardcase set off a chain reaction that blew apart the vehicle. However, with four more Impending Assault Tanks still operational, Rex ordered his men to regroup and take cover from the mechanical monstrosities. With only a few seconds' lead over the tanks, Rex had his troops plant thermal detonators along the ravine corridor through which the tanks were advancing. The soldiers then retreated into the bottleneck, luring the crawlers into the booby-trapped passage.\n\nOnce the tanks had fallen into their trap, Rex detonated the explosives, and he was blown into the air from the resulting blast, which consumed the four tanks. He and his men continued on in a single group, making their way through the seared wreckage of the tanks, one of which was still active. At Rex's word, Hardcase blasted its cockpit apart with a missile, and Rex made quick work of its Umbaran pilot. The clones also cut through several banshees that had been picking at some of their slain comrades, though Rex had to order Kix to leave behind the fallen and move on. As they neared the airbase, Rex and his men halted when they felt the ground shudder from doubtlessly more Umbaran forces. Sure enough, when Rex surveyed the area ahead with electrobinoculars, he saw that a far more deadly threat had been unleashed upon them: titanic six-legged juggernauts known as Umbaran mobile heavy cannons, each fitted with a powerful electromagnetic plasma cannon. He hurriedly ordered his men to fall back as the mobile heavy cannons opened fire, but the 501st platoons suffered severe casualties. Despite soliciting reinforcements from Krell, Rex was told that the rest of the 501st was guarding the entrance to the gorge so that his men could press forward to the airbase.\n\nForced to obey Krell's direct order to stand his ground against the cannons, Rex mobilized his men, directing Kix to keep the wounded as quiet as possible. Although Fives and Jesse objected to Krell's head-on plan, neither of them had any ideas for an alternative strategy, so they fell in line with Rex in spite of their misgivings. Their RPS-6 launchers proved ineffective against the mobile cannons' armor, and the 501st troops continued to endure egregious losses. In the tumult, Kix called out for help with getting the wounded to safety, and Rex helped him carry one of the injured troopers to cover in nearby vegetation. When Kix made to rescue more of the wounded and resented Rex's orders for the contrary, Rex told Kix that he needed to survive the current crisis to be able to administer aid later. Although Tup was losing hope that they would be able to hold out, Rex, surveying the airbase once more, had an idea about how to destroy the juggernauts. He sent Fives and Hardcase to commandeer two of the base's Umbaran starfighters, which would provide some much-needed air support. Krell was infuriated when he learned of Rex's alternative plan and ordered him to continue his frontal strike under threat of being relieved of duty. Rex did so with the intention of distracting the Umbarans long enough for Fives and Hardcase to complete their stealth incursion, placing his trust in them.",

As the droids under the command of General Grievous were about to enter the clone barracks, Cody, Rex and the others ambushed them. Cody and Rex then took cover as the droids came in. Cody threw grenades at the droids just as Rex signaled the cadets to open fire from their bunkers. Cody tried to stop 99 from getting more grenades but he was shot by the droids. After they defeated the droids, Cody called 99 a true soldier. Later, Cody and Rex informed Echo and Fives that they had been promoted to ARC Troopers.

        "content": "# Rex - The Zygerrian Slave Empire[]\n\nFollowing the Confederacy's invasion of the Togrutan artisan colony of Kiros\u2014a peaceful society that had, up until that point, avoided being ensnared in the war\u2014the Jedi High Council sent a Grand Army detachment led by Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi to liberate the world. Troops from Rex's 501st Legion and Cody's 212th Attack Battalion were assigned to the joint task force, which arrived at Kiros aboard a Republic Navy fleet ten rotations after the Separatists' takeover of the world. Rex served as one of the officers aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer that had replaced the Resolute, which had fallen at the previous Battle of Sullust. Rex discovered that there were no Separatist craft in the system from the earlier invasion force and, on Kenobi's order, moved their Star Destroyer into position for deployment. The Republic troops transferred to an Acclamator-class transport, whereupon they departed for the surface with AT-TE and AT-RT walkers aboard LAAT/i gunships. Upon landing in the capital city, Skywalker and Kenobi elected to patrol the city for Separatist activity on BARC speeders. Rex manned the sidecar of Kenobi's speeder while Tano rode with Skywalker, with other speeder-mounted 501st troopers falling into line behind them as they proceeded through the city streets.\n\nSpeeding through the city, Rex and his comrades were surprised to encounter an utter lack of Togruta colonists, who Skywalker and Kenobi assumed were hiding to wait out the fighting. Kenobi believed that they would have an easier time repelling the Separatists without having to worry about the risk of civilian casualties, but Rex was apprehensive about the situation, noting that the Separatists had never hesitated in the past to exploit civilians as living shields. As they headed for the city center, the silence from the absent colonists was broken by the appearance of Separatist forces ahead, taking the form of BX-series droid commandos riding Flitknot speeders. Rex and his men quickly returned the approaching biker droids' fire with their BARC speeders' repeating blasters, and they cut through a number of the droid commandos before passing by them. When the battle droids caught up with them again from behind, Rex and Tano revolved their sidecars and focused their blasterfire on the enemy units, eliminating the remainder of the droids between the two of them.\n\nAs they approaching the governor's tower at the city center, Rex and his comrades encountered more Separatist defenses, this time including two Armored Assault Tanks. While the others took care of the battle droids, Rex made quick work of one of the tanks, blowing it to pieces with a warhead from his RPS-6 rocket launcher before it could fire at his men. Tano destroyed the other tank with a pair of thermal detonators, and the last of the battle droids in the area were eradicated. At Kenobi's behest, Rex deployed his 501st troops to secure the vicinity around the city center. AT-TE walkers were brought in as the Republic forces established a perimeter around the governor's tower, wherein the Separatist commander, a Zygerrian known as Darts D'Nar, had barricaded himself. When Kenobi went to negotiate terms for surrender with D'Nar, he discovered that D'Nar had set up thermal annihilator bombs all over the city to be used as last-resort leverage against the Republic forces. Skywalker and Tano deactivated all nine of the annihilator bombs before D'Nar could use them to destroy the capital, and they also managed to prevent D'Nar from escaping off-world aboard his Zygerrian slave ship, the Tecora.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Other abilities\n\nIn addition to her Force powers and lightsaber combat skills, Tano was a talented pilot and also displayed skill as a war strategist by leading an attack that penetrated a Separatist blockade on Ryloth. During the Clone Wars, Tano passed on some of her flight knowledge to Senator Amidala, instructing her in starfighter combat. Due to her piloting skills, Tano found work as a courier for the Fardi clan while on the run from the Empire. She believed her skill in flying came from being trained by Anakin Skywalker, whom she considered the best pilot in the galaxy.\n\nTano displayed skill in hand-to-hand combat, as she easily overpowered Cad Bane before dropping her guard and being incapacitated by the bounty hunter. She later used her hand-to-hand combat skills on Mandalore by single-handedly defeating a group of the Mandalorian Secret Service and later holding off several guards and subduing Prime Minister Almec despite being handcuffed. However, on that occasion, she armed herself with one of the guards' shields, which she used to fend them off and defend herself from a stun gun. While she was a prisoner of Trandoshan hunters, Tano killed the hunters Dar and his father, Garnac, by only using hand-to-hand combat and her Force powers.\n\nTano had a considerable knowledge of mechanics, which she had learned from her master. She used her mechanical skills to contact Skywalker and save her and Barriss Offee's lives when they were trapped under a destroyed droid factory on Geonosis. She also knew how to repair vehicles. While on Mortis, she repaired the shuttle that she, Kenobi and Skywalker had crashed on the planet. Tano later used her skills as a mechanic as her occupation after Order 66 and the fall of the Republic, repairing starships and threshers while hiding on Thabeska and Raada. Tano assembled her new twin lightsabers from scrap metal parts she had acquired from the Fardis.\n\nTano understood Shyriiwook, as demonstrated by her translations for Chewbacca while captured on Wasskah. During their mission to Malachor, Tano was able to read some words in Ur-Kitt\u00e2t, the ancient Sith language. Tano also was an effective military tactician, as well as a good leader and teacher.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Weapons\n\nAhsoka Tano owned two different pairs of lightsabers. She originally built her first lightsaber, which had a silver cylindrical hilt and a green blade, before becoming Anakin Skywalker's Padawan at the Battle of Christophsis. She wielded this lightsaber by itself for some time, before constructing a shoto lightsaber with a matching hilt and a yellow-green blade to accompany it upon taking up Jar'Kai. Both sabers had kyber crystals from the sacred planet of Ilum. Tano wielded both lightsabers in battle until her departure from the Jedi Order, upon which the weapons fell into the care of her former master Skywalker. While they were in his custody, Skywalker tinkered with them to improve them, which led to the sabers having blue blades when he returned them to Tano before the start of the Siege of Mandalore. Tano would later abandon the sabers on a moon after the issuing of Order 66 in order to fake her death to the Empire.\n\nOver a year after the Clone Wars, Tano constructed a new pair of lightsabers, these ones with white blades, during the evacuation of Raada. The weapons initially had rough handles made of pieces of scrap Tano had acquired on her journeys, although she later rebuilt the hilts to be more functional and decorative. The kyber crystals within, as well as their mountings, came from the lightsaber of the Inquisitor Sixth Brother, whom Tano had defeated on Raada. Tano found the crystals familiar, and speculated they had been looted from the Jedi Temple after the Order's fall. After claiming the crystals, she purified them of the taint of the dark side until they shone white before assembling the weapons with scrap materials she had collected. These white lightsabers continued to serve her during the early rebellion, as she used them in battle against multiple Inquisitors, as well as Darth Vader.\n\nDuring her time on Thabeska in the first year of the Empire, Tano also owned a unidentified blaster model which she used against Stormtroopers while escaping the planet of Thabeska. She destroyed it in order to provide a diversion for her escape. When her starship was captured by Chardri Tage and Tamsin, agents of Bail Organa, after her second departure from Thabeska, Tano knocked them out with a pair of bastons she had selected from the ship's weapons box.\n\n",

A short time later, when Kenobi was sent to investigate a Separatist presence on Utapau, he instructed Commander Cody and his 212th Attack Battalion to follow shortly after him. As it turned out, Utapau was acting as a temporary safe haven for the Separatist Council, with General Grievous and his droid armies acting as their protectors. During the Battle of Utapau, Commander Cody led his team of men into Pau City, along with Parjai Squad and various other paratrooping squads. During the attack, Kenobi dropped his lightsaber, which hit the ground in front of him, and he would later return it to the General.\n\nAs Obi-Wan engaged Grievous in a fierce lightsaber duel, Cody battled the droid forces. It was during the fighting that he received Order 66 via an encrypted channel from the Supreme Chancellor, who was secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Despite being comrades-in-arms with Kenobi, Cody's loyalty to the Republic overrode his loyalty to Kenobi. In response, Cody ordered one of his AT-TEs to fire at Kenobi and his varactyl mount, Boga, causing the two to plummet to the bottom of the sinkhole.\n\nCody, all too aware of Jedi prowess, was not convinced of Kenobi's death, and sent Arakyd Prowler 1000 probe droids into the catacombs beneath Pau City to look for him. After following through with Palpatine's orders, he rallied his troops, and within the hour the Separatists were routed and Pau City was under Republic control. Cody's fears were confirmed when he was informed by a lieutenant that General Grievous's personal starfighter had fled the planet.

        "content": "# Rex - Against General Krell[]\n\nThe 501st Legion established a staging area at the Umbaran airbase, making use of its barracks and attempting to crack the Umbaran starfighter access codes so that they could be converted for Republic use. However, the capture of the base had come at high casualties, further sowing mistrust with Krell's leadership within the 501st ranks. Furthermore, Rex and Krell soon discovered from Kenobi that the seizure of the airbase had not, ultimately, severed the capital's supply lines as they had hoped. Holographically conferring with Kenobi at the airbase's command center, Rex and Krell learned that the Umbarans had begun to receive arms shipments from a Separatist supply ship in orbit. With that new source, the Umbarans were continuing long-range missile attacks on Kenobi's position, preventing him from reaching the capital. When Rex inquired after the possibility of destroying the orbital supply ship, Kenobi stated that they had been unable to do so thus far due to the Separatist fleet's greater strength, leading Krell to resolve to take the capital regardless of the threat of the missiles. Before Kenobi could respond, the connection was severed due to enemy interference. Proceeding to ground level, Krell ordered that the 501st Legion be ready to move out in twelve hours for an assault on the capital, ignoring Rex's concerns that they should coordinate their attack with Kenobi's battalion even as the Umbaran missile strikes targeted an area adjacent to the airbase.\n\nRex joined his men in Hangar 9-4, where the clones were working to break the starfighter access codes. Upon learning of Krell's decision to continue the push toward the capital, Fives, Jesse, and Tup were disgusted with their general's head-on tactics. Rex did not agree with Krell's plan either but could not think of a better option to suggest to him. Fives solved that dilemma when he revealed that Jesse had cracked the starfighter access codes\u2014they now had the ability to infiltrate the Separatist blockade as friendlies and eliminate the supply ship. Rex took Fives' proposal to Krell, who\u2014obstinate as ever\u2014dismissed it out of a lack of faith in the clone troopers' ability to pilot the alien-designed starfighters, in spite of Rex's belief in his men's faculty for adaptivity. When Rex broke the news to Hardcase, Tup, Jesse, and Fives in the barracks, Fives proposed that they carry on with their illegal plan and accept the consequences, which would, at the very least, involve being court-martialed. Although he stated that he would have given the strategy his support if they had more time and training, Rex resolved that they lacked both. He continued to argue with Fives outside of the barracks, seeing his comrade's intention to disobey orders as bereft of honor.\n\nUnable to convince Rex that Krell's orders were not worth following, Fives stubbornly left to round up some volunteers for the mission. He recruited Jesse and Hardcase as pilots for the Umbaran starfighters, but they drew Krell's attention when Hardcase accidentally liquidated the door of Hangar 9-4 while test-piloting one of the starfighters. Although Fives and Hardcase managed to convince Krell that the incident was a result of an enemy booby trap encoded in the starfighter, Krell simply cited it to Rex and Fives as further reason that the craft were too dangerous for their use. Krell consequently grounded the fighters, leaving Rex exasperated with Fives and Hardcase's actions. That night, while leading a full perimeter sweep to patrol for enemy activity in the outlying forest, Rex was sought out by Fives, Hardcase, and Jesse, who revealed that they were going to attack the supply ship in spite of the consequences for disobedience. When Fives asked him if he intended to stop them, Rex resignedly replied that he would not be able to help them when they got caught. After returning to the airbase, Rex witnessed the trio's launch from the hangar bay, and Krell thereafter confronted him about the illegal launch. Covering for his men, Rex claimed that he had authorized their launch so that they could reconnoiter the delta in preparation for the march on the capital, promising a full report to Krell once his men returned.",

        "content": "# Rex - Against General Krell[]\n\nRex's platoon was soon assaulted by enemy forces, though the shrouded environment prevented them from identifying their attackers. He sent his men forward with mortar launchers, and they bombarded the enemy lines with artillery rounds. Kix, using his night vision filters, saw that the opposing soldiers were wearing 212th armor and concluded that they were disguised Umbarans, just as Krell had cautioned. The ensuing battle saw both the 501st and their enemies sustain scores of casualties. Yet as Rex was to soon discover, the attacking soldiers were not Umbarans. While heading through the battlefield, he noticed a fallen enemy soldier in a nearby grove and removed the trooper's helmet to verify his identity. To his abject horror, the face underneath was not Umbaran, but that of another clone trooper. Distraught, Rex ran out onto the battlefield, frantically ordering his men to cease their fire and take off their helmets to show that they were not enemies. He took the risk of doing so himself to halt the rising carnage, even tackling one of the enemy soldiers and removing the trooper's helmet to further show both sides that all of them were clones, none of them enemies. The 212th-marked soldiers took off their helmets as well, equally aghast that they had attacked their brethren from the 501st.\n\nAs the hostilities dissolved into shock about the wrongful massacre, the 501st and the 212th tended to the many wounded and fallen. While a distressed Tup and Dogma questioned why their fellow soldiers had attacked them, Kix sought out Rex and reported that he had found Waxer, who had served as the platoon leader from the 212th and would surely have some answers to their questions. Kix led Rex and Dogma to Waxer, who was on the brink of death, being tended to by another 212th trooper. Removing his fellow veteran's helmet, Rex spoke face-to-face with the ailing Waxer and asked him who had ordered the 212th to attack the 501st. With his final breaths, Waxer revealed that Krell was responsible. The general had supplied the coordinates to assault alleged enemy forces who, they had been told, were disguised in clone trooper armor. While Waxer died, Rex\u2014having long suspected that Krell's recklessness was rooted in darkness\u2014realized that Krell was, in fact, a traitor to the Republic, and he resolved to arrest their general on charges of treason. Gathering the 501st and 212th survivors, Rex told them of his intentions and mobilized them to bring Krell to justice. Knowing that what he proposed was highly treasonous, he gave his troops the option to opt out, though all of them decided to stand by him.\n\nLeading his men back to the airbase, Rex first stopped by the prison block with Kix and Tup to release and rearm Fives and Jesse, who fell in line with the others. They all proceeded to the command tower, where they stormed into the control room and surrounded Krell, training their blasters on him. Rex informed Krell that he was being relieved of duty and demanded his surrender, though Krell responded by proclaiming the clones' inferiority and releasing a massive Force pulse against his would-be captors. Krell activated his double-bladed lightsabers and used them to great effect, cutting through many of the soldiers in a matter of moments. Rex himself narrowly avoided being hit by a corpse that Krell kicked in his direction. Refusing to let Rex and the clone troopers undermine him, Krell broke out of the command tower, smashing through the viewing window and forcing his way through the troops who confronted him below. By the time Rex made it to ground level with Jesse, Fives, and the others, Krell had escaped into the forest, leaving behind a long trail of carnage. Before they could pursue, Rex and his comrades were challenged by Dogma, who tried to retain his loyalties to his general, proclaiming that all of the clone troopers were traitors for turning on Krell.",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Development\n\nEarly in The Clone Wars' development, the character who became Ahsoka Tano was very involved in the black market and worked with Jedi without getting involved in the Clone Wars. She would try to prevent criminals from taking advantage of the war. Supervising director Dave Filoni and executive producer George Lucas decided that including a Padawan was important, and Lucas wanted her to be Anakin Skywalker's Padawan. He explained that she would give Skywalker someone to teach and her inclusion would create a dynamic between her, Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. As of 2005, the character was named Ashla, a reference to an early name for the light side of the Force when Lucas was developing Star Wars, and later canonized as the Lasat name of the Force. Ashla is also the name of one Togruta Jedi youngling who appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Filoni played with the idea of them being the same character, but he realized the ages would not work. The two characters, however, are otherwise unrelated.\n\nLucas replaced the name \"Ashla\" with \"Ashoka\" after Ashoka the Great, the Indian Emperor of the Maurya Dynasty. Henry Gilroy then tweaked it to \"Ahsoka\" to make her name unique. Ahsoka Tano was one of the first characters that Filoni drew when he was working at Lucasfilm, inspired by San, the female wolf-riding protagonist of the 1997 Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli film Princess Mononoke. Ahsoka's facial markings were partially inspired by those of San. The character was revealed on January 29, 2008, on StarWars.com, along with toy industry shows.\n\nProducer Catherine Winder felt The Clone Wars crew was fortunate in finding Eckstein, as she felt the actress naturally embodied the character. Eckstein recorded the show's first season before the film premiered in 2008. She had many conversations with Filoni, and she spoke with Lucas about their hopes for Tano and her journey in the series. Ultimately, Tano's story, particularly the events surrounding her decision to leave the Jedi Order, became a major part of Skywalker's own story and, ultimately, his fall to the dark side. Indeed, Filoni himself noted as such in the \"Obi-Wan Undercover\" featurette for Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Four: in teasing the story of Tano leaving the Jedi, he noted Season Five included a story that helped explain why Skywalker believed the Jedi Order had betrayed his trust. However, even though there were ideas for her to die during The Clone Wars, Filoni did not want Tano's character to just exist as another factor that pushed Skywalker to the dark side. He figured that, if Tano only existed to be part of Skywalker's story, she would have been included in the films.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - The Zygerrian Slave Empire[]\n\nFollowing the Confederacy's invasion of the Togrutan artisan colony of Kiros\u2014a peaceful society that had, up until that point, avoided being ensnared in the war\u2014the Jedi High Council sent a Grand Army detachment led by Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi to liberate the world. Troops from Rex's 501st Legion and Cody's 212th Attack Battalion were assigned to the joint task force, which arrived at Kiros aboard a Republic Navy fleet ten rotations after the Separatists' takeover of the world. Rex served as one of the officers aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer that had replaced the Resolute, which had fallen at the previous Battle of Sullust. Rex discovered that there were no Separatist craft in the system from the earlier invasion force and, on Kenobi's order, moved their Star Destroyer into position for deployment. The Republic troops transferred to an Acclamator-class transport, whereupon they departed for the surface with AT-TE and AT-RT walkers aboard LAAT/i gunships. Upon landing in the capital city, Skywalker and Kenobi elected to patrol the city for Separatist activity on BARC speeders. Rex manned the sidecar of Kenobi's speeder while Tano rode with Skywalker, with other speeder-mounted 501st troopers falling into line behind them as they proceeded through the city streets.\n\nSpeeding through the city, Rex and his comrades were surprised to encounter an utter lack of Togruta colonists, who Skywalker and Kenobi assumed were hiding to wait out the fighting. Kenobi believed that they would have an easier time repelling the Separatists without having to worry about the risk of civilian casualties, but Rex was apprehensive about the situation, noting that the Separatists had never hesitated in the past to exploit civilians as living shields. As they headed for the city center, the silence from the absent colonists was broken by the appearance of Separatist forces ahead, taking the form of BX-series droid commandos riding Flitknot speeders. Rex and his men quickly returned the approaching biker droids' fire with their BARC speeders' repeating blasters, and they cut through a number of the droid commandos before passing by them. When the battle droids caught up with them again from behind, Rex and Tano revolved their sidecars and focused their blasterfire on the enemy units, eliminating the remainder of the droids between the two of them.\n\nAs they approaching the governor's tower at the city center, Rex and his comrades encountered more Separatist defenses, this time including two Armored Assault Tanks. While the others took care of the battle droids, Rex made quick work of one of the tanks, blowing it to pieces with a warhead from his RPS-6 rocket launcher before it could fire at his men. Tano destroyed the other tank with a pair of thermal detonators, and the last of the battle droids in the area were eradicated. At Kenobi's behest, Rex deployed his 501st troops to secure the vicinity around the city center. AT-TE walkers were brought in as the Republic forces established a perimeter around the governor's tower, wherein the Separatist commander, a Zygerrian known as Darts D'Nar, had barricaded himself. When Kenobi went to negotiate terms for surrender with D'Nar, he discovered that D'Nar had set up thermal annihilator bombs all over the city to be used as last-resort leverage against the Republic forces. Skywalker and Tano deactivated all nine of the annihilator bombs before D'Nar could use them to destroy the capital, and they also managed to prevent D'Nar from escaping off-world aboard his Zygerrian slave ship, the Tecora.\n\nAlthough the Republic succeeded in securing Kiros, a planetary bioscan conducted by Admiral Yularen revealed that the Togruta colonists, all 50,000 of them, had completely vanished from their world. When Skywalker and Tano interrogated him, D'Nar revealed that the Zygerrian queen was reviving the Zygerrian Slave Empire of old, a slave-trading government that had prospered for centuries before the Jedi Order had dismantled it, forcing its slave trade to fester in the criminal underworld. The Togruta were to be auctioned off into slavery on Zygerria, but the Jedi were determined to prevent the colonists from becoming slaves. To that end, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi took the Tecora to Zygerria, where they intended to infiltrate the Slave Empire and locate the missing Togruta. En route to the Zygerria system, Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi assumed uniforms to pose as Zygerrian slave traders, while Tano masqueraded as a Togruta slave. After landing at a Zygerrian slave market, Rex and his comrades set off on their mission. While Skywalker distracted the Zygerrian queen, Miraj Scintel, Rex and Kenobi were to find the Togruta colonists. Splitting up from Skywalker and Tano, whom Prime Minister Atai Molec escorted to the Zygerrian Royal Palace, Rex and Kenobi proceeded to the Royal Palace's outdoor slave cells, where they discovered only one Togruta prisoner, an ailing Governor Roshti of Kiros.\n\nWith royal Zygerrian guards patrolling the compound, Rex kept watch for Kenobi to retrieve Roshti, who was too weak to reveal anything about the whereabouts of the other missing Togruta. Recognizing the need to spirit Roshti away from the Royal Palace, Kenobi commandeered a brezak lizard mount from a Zygerrian guard and helped Rex bring Roshti onto the creature's back. As other Zygerrian guards in the vicinity caught sight and ordered them to stop, Rex took up the brezak's reins and steered their mount for the other end of the compound. However, a Zygerrian guard shot Kenobi in the shoulder, and both he and Roshti fell off the brezak. Rex was forced to leave them behind and escaped while Kenobi and Roshti were captured. That evening, Rex proceeded to the royal auction house to provide support for Skywalker and Tano at Queen Scintel's Royal Slave Auction, in which the Togruta colonists were to be sold into slavery. While a Zygerrian auctioneer introduced the recaptured Roshti as a sample of the Togruta, Rex caught the eye of Skywalker, who was with Tano and Scintel in the queen's private viewing box, and showed him his acquired Zygerrian blaster rifle as a gesture of being ready for action. However, Rex and his comrades were met with a grim surprise when Kenobi was brought out onto the auction block as a \"special guest\" of the queen.\n\nDenouncing the Jedi as slaves to a corrupt Republic Senate, Scintel ordered Skywalker to whip Kenobi to teach the Jedi Master his place. Just as he activated his shock whip, Skywalker checked that both Rex and Tano were prepared for action, then joined Kenobi in attacking the Zygerrian guards on the auction block. As the guards in the stands opened fire on his comrades below, Rex disarmed one of the Zygerrians and shot at another group of them, exploding that part of the floor. With two blaster rifles in hand, he was stopped by a trio of royal guards and was then attacked from behind by another. Both Rex and his assailant fell out of the stands, landing on the ground several stories below. Before Rex had much time to recover, Scintel sent in reinforcements to subdue the infiltrators. The touch of a shock whip electrified Rex into unconsciousness, and Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi were similarly defeated. The Zygerrians sent all four of them into slavery: While Scintel forced Skywalker to become her personal bodyguard, Rex and the others became her leverage to keep Skywalker in his place. Tano was imprisoned outside the Royal Palace, and Rex and Kenobi, fitted with shock collars, were meanwhile sent to be processed as slaves with Roshti.\n\nThe Zygerrian slave ship Delta-T-3 transported Rex, Kenobi, and Roshti to the volcanic world of Kadavo, where the Zygerrians maintained a mining complex over a volcanic crater. Rex and the others laid eyes on the population of Kiros, whom Agruss, the keeper of the facility, was subjugating into slavery for processing by the Zygerrian Slave Empire. As part of his welcome for his newest charges, Agruss dropped seven of the Togruta colonists into the crater below, making it clear that the Togruta would suffer for any trace of defiance from Kenobi. Rex and Kenobi were quickly forced into work alongside the Togruta in mining materials at the facility. On one occasion, while Kenobi was commenting to Rex on the state of the despairing Togruta, one of the Zygerrian slave masters interrupted him, whipping Kenobi as punishment for speaking. The Zygerrian then turned his shock whip on a nearby Togruta slave, forcing Kenobi to submit to save the colonist's life. Rex and Kenobi thus realized that the Zygerrians intended to break Kenobi's spirit by punishing the Togruta instead of him. As Rex and Kenobi's days in slavery continued, they were shackled in handcuffs and brought before Agruss in the facility's command center to speak with none other than Count Dooku via holoconnection. Having learned of the Zygerrians' capture of the Jedi, Dooku had ousted an uncooperative Scintel from power and had ordered the immediate execution of Rex and Kenobi.\n\nJust then, the Tecora made an unscheduled landing at the Kadavo mining complex. Aboard were Skywalker, Tano, and R2-D2, who had escaped from Scintel's custody on Zygerria and had come to rescue Rex, Kenobi, and the Togruta. The Zygerrians destroyed the Tecora, though an unfazed Skywalker and Tano began to cut through the facility's outer blast door with their lightsabers. Meanwhile, the Zygerrians rounded up all of the Togruta colonists in a holding cell and prepared to dump them into the crater below if Skywalker did not call off his forces. Nevertheless, Skywalker continued his efforts when his reinforcements arrived: Plo Koon and a Republic Star Destroyer under the command of Admiral Coburn. With the complex under attack by Koon's starfighter forces, Kenobi used the Force to sever his and Rex's shock collars, and the two attacked their Zygerrian captors. Rex disabled his handcuffs with a Zygerrian's electrostaff and took down several slavers on his own, pilfering an electrostaff from one and head-butting another. In response to the outbreak of hostilities, Agruss activated the mechanism that would open the Togruta slaves' holding cell over the crater, jamming the controls so that Rex and Kenobi could not deactivate it.\n\nAs Rex and Kenobi finished off the Zygerrian guards, the cornered Agruss attempted to barter for his life, taunting Kenobi that a Jedi would not kill an unarmed man such as himself. Though Kenobi was unable to pass judgment on him, Agruss failed to account for Rex, who did not share Kenobi's reservations and threw an electrostaff at Agruss. The staff plunged straight through Agruss and the back of his hoverchair, killing him. Rex and Kenobi then left the command center and joined Skywalker out on the landing pad, where Koon's Wolfpack landed an LAAT/i gunship to retrieve them. In the meantime, Coburn took the Arquitens-class light cruiser Hand of Justice to assist Tano in rescuing the Togruta slaves from their holding cell. Once all of the Togruta were safely aboard the Hand of Justice, the Republic's LAAT/i gunships moved in and compromised the building's supports, plunging the entire complex into the crater below. Following the successful rescue, Rex, Skywalker, Tano and Kenobi were taken to Koon's Star Destroyer with the Togruta colonists, who began to receive treatment to recover from their ordeal in enslavement. After receiving Roshti's thanks for their efforts, Rex and Commander Wolffe convened in the main hangar with their Jedi commanders to debrief the operation.\n\nWhen Supreme Chancellor Palpatine became the target of a Separatist kidnapping plot, Rex and some of his men from the 501st were assigned to be bodyguards for him, serving as extra security at the Chancellor's Suite on Coruscant. Meanwhile, the Jedi High Council authorized an operation to infiltrate the enemy plot. The sniper Rako Hardeen was allowed to appear to kill Kenobi, who then went undercover as Hardeen to gain the trust of Moralo Eval, the mastermind behind the conspiracy. After learning from Palpatine that Hardeen\u2014actually Kenobi in disguise\u2014had escaped to the planet Nal Hutta with Eval and Cad Bane, Skywalker went after the sniper who had murdered his former Master, while Rex and two of his soldiers remained behind to guard Palpatine. That night, Mace Windu contacted Rex via the latter's Imagecaster and asked for Skywalker, who had failed to respond to his calls. Although Rex tried to hide his general's unsanctioned departure from the capital, Palpatine revealed that he had personally sent Skywalker to Nal Hutta, believing that the High Council should have more faith in Skywalker and his abilities. Palpatine ended the exchange with Windu by informing Rex that he was withdrawing for the night, and Rex and his men escorted him back to his apartment. Thanks to Kenobi's undercover efforts, the Jedi Order thwarted the kidnapping plot two days later at the Festival of Light on Naboo, preventing Eval and Bane from capturing Palpatine.\n\n",

        "content": "# Cody - Imperial Career[]\n\nSoon after Order 66, Palpatine's rise to power was completed with his ascension as Emperor of the first Galactic Empire. As a result of the Grand Army's reorganization into the Stormtrooper Corps, Commander Cody and the remaining clone troopers who survived the Clone Wars composed the first generation of Imperial stormtroopers. Ultimately, Cody remained in service to the New Order for years. In that time, he witnessed the rise in recruitment of birth-born Humans as enlisted troopers, which in turn led to the decline and marginalization of the original Jango Fett clones.\n\nBy the year 1 BBY, Commander Cody was in charge of an Imperial Battalion that was stationed in Timira City, one of the cloning facilities located on his homeworld of Kamino. In addition to providing security to the facility, he regularly tested his soldiers with drill exercises, only to be profoundly disappointed by the enlisted troopers under his command. Likewise, the men were not particularly fond of the Commander's leadership style. One recruit expressed his disdain\u2014a sentiment shared by his comrades\u2014for patrol duty. To the troopers, patrolling Timira City was not only unnecessary due to Kamino's heavily fortified condition; it was extremely aggravating because of the seemingly endless rain and thunderstorms. In sum, the inhospitable climate conditions of Kamino and Cody's bitter attitude produced a significantly low troop morale among the men.\n\nAround the same time, the Imperials failed to prevent one of Darth Vader's test subjects\u2014a rogue clone of the original Starkiller\u2014from escaping Kamino in the Dark Lord's own TIE fighter. The clone later returned at the head of the Alliance Fleet, hence resulting in the Assault on Kamino. The Imperial garrison in Timira City was ultimately wiped out and Vader himself was captured by the Rebel Alliance, thus marking the Rebellion's first major victory in the Galactic Civil War, and leaving Cody's fate ambiguous.\n\n",

At Ryloth and Umbara, Tano flew her own Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor. Later, while fighting in the defense of the planet Cato Neimoidia, she piloted a newer Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor, in what would be her last battle before leaving the Jedi Order. Both starfighters sported dark red paint jobs with a white Jedi symbol over the top of it, and were co-piloted by her personal astromech droid, R7-A7.\n\nTano often flew missions with Anakin Skywalker in the Corellian G9 Rigger-class light freighter Twilight in the earlier stages of the Clone Wars, including at the Battle of Teth, the Battle of Abregado, the Mission to Skytop Station, and the Mission to Mustafar.\n\nAfter her departure from the Jedi, Tano purchased a Joben T-85 speeder bike that was so prone to breaking down, Trace Martez dubbed it \"Trash\" when asked to name it. Tano left the bike with the Martez sisters at their repair shop when she left to search for Maul with Bo-Katan Kryze, saying that she would come back for it.\n\nUpon her first departure from Thabeska, Tano stole a small and unremarkable freighter from the Fardi clan, which she used to travel around before and during the occupation of Raada, as well as when she returned to the Fardis. Tano flew an A-wing starfighter on missions during the early rebellion, including to Takobo. Following the battle of Endor, Tano traveled to Lothal in a T-6 shuttle to meet her friend Sabine Wren.\n\n",

In the comic, Anakin Skywalker, Tano and Clone Captain Rex were returning from a successful mission onboard the Resolute. After Rex told them that their missions were too easy, the two Jedi planned to test the Captain by manipulating a training session for new clone troopers that was led by Rex. Tano disguised herself as a clone trooper named Tank, while Anakin Skywalker disguised himself as clone trooper Thrower to take part in a course in the Tipoca City Training Facility on Kamino. While they were fighting B1 battle droids that were repurposed as training droids, a voltage peak caused the droids to become much more aggressive and skilled in combat. The droids managed to break out of the training arena, after which Tano and Skywalker, still disguised as clone troopers, joined forces with Rex and other troopers to stop the rogue group of droids. While they were fighting in the hallways of Tipoca City, the clone trooper Glider went into the control room and destroyed the controls with his blaster, which caused the battle droids to be powered down. As Rex gathered the troopers to thank them, Tano and Skywalker took of their helmets and revealed themselves. They explained that they wanted to test the Captain and Rex responded that he wouldn't call their missions easy ever again. He then invited them to join his bowling team if they ever left the Jedi Order.\n\nTano is depicted alongside Plo Koon on the cover of the Star Wars: Shatterpoint \"First Contact\" Mission Pack, which depicts both Jedi involved with a struggle against droidekas in a city environment during the Clone Wars. It is unclear if this is meant to be taken as a canonical event.\n\n",

Cody and Kenobi developed as close a relationship as was allowed after months of fighting side-by-side.\n\nIn an effort to bring the war to an early conclusion, the Republic launched an assault on Cato Neimoidia, home to Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray's redoubt. As the battle to capture Viceroy Gunray's majestic redoubt raged, Cody's Squad Seven, led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, managed to penetrate the Separatists' inner-defenses and fought its way into the complex. While they were unable to capture the Viceroy himself, they were able to capture vital intelligence. In his hurry to evacuate the redoubt, Gunray left behind his mechno-chair, from the which the Republic was able to learn of the coming Separatist attack on the planet Belderone.\n\nIn what was publicly announced as an effort to bring a swift end to the war, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine committed an additional 200,000 troopers to the Outer Rim Sieges.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett\n\nIn February, 2017, a Star Wars fan asked Dawson on Twitter if she would ever play Ahsoka Tano, and she replied that she would want to play her, causing fans to be excited about Tano appearing in live-action. According to Dawson, someone at Lucasfilm forwarded the Tweet to The Mandalorian executive producer Dave Filoni, and he thought she would make a good Ahsoka Tano. Filoni and Star Wars then followed Dawson on Twitter, but nothing happened for a long time. Filoni kept loosely aware of Dawson's Marvel career and he watched interviews of her expressing excitement for the role. When Dawson and Filoni discussed the show, he revisited Dawson's casting and realized Dawson's age would fit Tano's age in the show, and he decided the casting was feasible. Filoni and The Mandalorian creator and executive producer Jon Favreau did not want to include Tano in Season One because Filoni did not want to mess up Tano's portrayal.\n\nDuring early production of Season One, Favreau told Filoni that the Child's name would be Grogu, prompting Filoni to think of ways the audience could learn his name. He thought that Tano could learn Grogu's name by communicating through memories and experiences, and she could tell this to the Mandalorian and the audience. Filoni and Favreau knew they wanted Tano in the second season's story, so they started visualizing Dawson in the role, and art of the actress playing Tano was created. After they showed that art to Dawson, they asked if she would take the role and she agreed. Concept designer Brian Matyas explained that the effects team shortened Tano's lekku due to practicality reasons when performing stunts.\n\nTano appeared in the episode Chapter 13: The Jedi, which was written and directed by Filoni. According to Filoni, the episode was a test run to see how audiences would react to seeing Tano in live-action. When Filoni wrote the scene in which Tano reveals Grogu's history, he shaped it around when Obi-Wan Kenobi told Luke Skywalker about his father in A New Hope. When Filoni was working on the episode, he knew the actress who plays the Magistrate would have to be someone who can instantly challenge Tano. After being cast as Tano, Dawson watched The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, and the Star Wars saga as preparation. Dawson studied Ashley Eckstein's portrayal of Tano in animation and tried her best to honor it. Dawson was fascinated by how Tano was the center of \"this whole other world\" shown in The Clone Wars. Dawson played Tano like a wandering samurai and a knowledgeable knight. Filoni pointed to Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings as a touchpoint, and all of this factored into Dawson's portrayal. Dawson wanted to have Tano's playfulness and fun, including her cocky eyebrow. She liked Tano's wisdom and how she is grounded after everything she has gone through. Dawson enjoyed having homages to the different aspects of Tano. Filoni talked about classic samurai films such as Yojimbo, and he described Tano as someone wandering the galaxy helping people in need.\n\nMany screen tests were done because the Volume tends to look magenta. Everything in Tano's costume was considered to an intense degree, including her headtails and horns. Filoni wanted Tano's facial markings to be subtle and look very natural instead of looking like face paint in The Clone Wars. Makeup designer Brian Sipe had a difficult time finding the right look between human-realistic and pleasing to fans of The Clone Wars graphic image. The crew tried to make Tano's makeup warm and natural, as well as have a different energy compared to animation. Dawson wanted to be as authentic to the animated Tano as possible, so she insisted on wearing blue contacts to match the character's eye color. All of the prosthetics were built to Dawson's skull and body, and Tano's headband clipped in the back and held the headtails in place. The make-up artists tucked Dawson's hair away so she could wear the headpiece. The total transformation initially took three hours. Dawson thought the face markings, different skin color, and costume were incredible, but she did not feel like Tano until she put the contacts in. The crew had to worry about the Volume's temperature changing Tano's skin color, so small considerations were made and adjusted.\n\nTano was again played by Dawson in \"Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger,\" the sixth episode of The Book of Boba Fett television series. Dawson did not learn that her character would interact with Luke Skywalker until the day of filming. She was very excited that she got to work with Mark Hamill, who provided Skywalker's voice in the episode.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Christophsis[]\n\nSometime after the siege of Hisseen, Rex accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, Cody, and the rest of the Republic forces in their effort to liberate Christophsis from Confederate forces under General Whorm Loathsom and Count Dooku's assassin, Asajj Ventress. The captain took part in setting up an ambush on the approaching Separatist forces, but Kenobi and Cody were ambushed themselves. Skywalker rushed to his master's aid with Rex and his men alongside him. Fleeing to the rooftop, they held off the battle droids until evac arrived in the form of a LAAT/i gunship, with clone trooper Gus removing the commanding tactical droid's head before departing. Rex assisted Cody in performing a robolobotomy on the droid's head, discovering that it contained all of their intelligence. Surmising that this meant there was a spy in their midst, Skywalker and Kenobi departed to investigate the Confederate headquarters, hoping this would reveal the spy's identity. Rex and Cody were instructed to conduct their own search at the Republic base.\n\nAs they were leaving the command center, Cody noticed that someone had left their comlink on; their entire conversation had just been broadcast to the Separatist spy. Rex spotted someone in the corridor, and he and Cody gave chase. However, they lost him in the busy mess hall. They now realized the spy was a clone. Unable to reach the Jedi as a result of blocked communications, Rex had R2-D2 analyze the communication history to see if anyone had sent any unauthorized transmissions. He noticed irregular wavelengths that were too low and infrequent to be detected normally, wavelengths that were coming from Sergeant Slick's barracks. They proceeded to question Slick's men, all of whom had an alibi except Chopper, who lied about collecting battle droid fingers. However, Slick slipped when he revealed that he knew the Jedi were gone, drawing the suspicion of the entire group. Slick realized he was blown and fled, evading Rex and Cody while also blowing up the nearby weapons depot as well as many of the LAAT/i gunships and AT-TE walkers.\n\nFollowing a lead from Gus and Chopper, Rex and Cody ventured back to the command center. There, they noticed boot prints that trailed up towards the vents. Without a word between the two of them, Rex and Cody devised a trap; Rex pretended to leave the room, while Cody stood with his back to Slick's hiding spot as well as his blaster. Slick slid out of the vents and pointed the weapon at the back of Cody's head, but is shocked to learn that the blaster was empty, as Cody took the clip out beforehand. After a short fistfight, Rex and Cody subdued Slick, just as the Jedi returned from their fruitless trip to the Separatist headquarters. Skywalker verbally rebuked Slick for placing his brothers at risk, and Slick replied with an attack on the Jedi's enslavement of his brothers, the clones. Despite Slick scorching the entire weapons depot, Rex and Cody noted that they were able to save the heavy cannons.\n\nAs Loathsom's droid army moved in on their positions, Rex and his men accompanied Skywalker as he took on the tri-droids. Soon after, Rex met Skywalker's new Padawan apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, laughing as she called Skywalker \"Skyguy.\" For laughing, he was told to show her the ropes as a commanding officer, offering her advice and valuable leadership experience. He also stated that while she may outrank him, experience outranks everything.\n\nRex soon spotted the deflector shield being used by the incoming Confederate forces, rendering their cannons useless. After conferring with Kenobi, Cody, and Rex, Skywalker and Tano left to destroy the deflector shield, while Rex assisted Kenobi in holding back the droids before they could destroy the heavy cannons. As Kenobi led a charge against the droids, Rex and his men drew the droids into the buildings, making the fight more manageable for the clones. Despite this, most of Rex's unit was wiped out, and he was soon ordered to pull back his forces in order to protect the cannons. As Kenobi delayed Loathsom with a drawn-out surrender, Rex noticed the shield drop just in time and ordered the cannons to finish off the tanks, ending the battle. The battle had only been the beginning of the long partnership between Rex and what would prove to be a tightly knit group of Jedi consisting of Kenobi, Tano, and Skywalker. Through this partnership, Rex would learn his opinions were valued.\n\n",

When she participated in the Battle of Mon Cala, Tano wore a grey-and-red scuba suit, with a face mask that allowed her to breathe but left her montrals and lekku exposed to the water. During the Mission to Zygerria, undercover as a slave, Tano wore a turquoise outfit with gold jewelry and sandals, initially covered with a grey-purple body-covering robe. Tano also owned a reddish-grey winter coat lined with white fur, which she wore on cold planets such as Carlac and Ilum.\n\nDuring her time wandering Coruscant after leaving the Order, Tano wore a light blue mechanic's jumpsuit, along with a brown headpiece that went over her montrals and between her lekku and had a grey raised diamond on the front. She also carried a brown satchel. After being recruited by Bo-Katan Kryze and her resistance group to help pursue Maul, Tano was given a new combat outfit consisting of a blue-and-grey dress with a short skirt, blue tights, and grey boots, as well as forearm armor and fingerless gloves. The outfit also had Mandalorian beskar plating. After Order 66, she donned a grey cloak over that outfit.\n\nDuring the mission to rescue Janard, Tano wore an ocean jumpsuit. While fighting off Morgan Elsbeth's agents in the Denab system, Tano wore a blue spacesuit to survive the vacuum while directly defending against incoming starfighters.\n\n",

After General Skywalker and his Padawan, Commander Ahsoka Tano, managed to destroy the Separatist blockade surrounding the planet, the invasion forces were able to move in. Aboard an Acclamator assault ship, Cody boarded the Crumb Bomber with General Kenobi and Ghost Company, and the gunships took off to land in Nabat. Kenobi explained to Ghost Company that they had come to aid the Twi'leks, not destroy their home, and Cody instructed his men to utilize blasters and droid poppers only. However, after proton cannons from below attacked the Acclamator transports above, General Mace Windu tasked Obi-Wan and his men with destroying the cannons so that the transports could land. After destroying the droids in a bunker on the outskirts of the village, Obi-Wan and the clones entered the city and set up a temporary camp. Cody went with Wooley, Waxer and Boil to scout ahead, and after he and Wooley went to investigate the courtyard, they discovered that the Twi'leks were being held hostage. After Cody reported their findings back to Obi-Wan and Mace, Obi-Wan decided to continue with the plan; the prisoners would make it difficult, but not impossible.\n\nCody noticed the prolonged absence of Waxer and Boil, and sent a transmission to them before they moved out. Upon reentering the city, the group was attacked by gutkurrs, but Obi-Wan managed to lure the creatures with the Force into an alley. He instructed Cody and his men to fire at a bridge above the entrance to the alley, and the creatures were trapped. After Obi-Wan jumped over the rubble, Cody handed him back his lightsaber. Waxer and Boil them emerged out of an underground tunnel with the young Twi'lek girl Numa. Cody was initially displeased with their absence, but after he learned of their discovery of the tunnels, he softened up a bit. Cody led a diversion to distract the droids, while Obi-Wan went with Waxer, Boil and Numa through the tunnels to free the Twi'lek hostages. After everyone was in position, Cody led the attack, and Obi-Wan was able to free the prisoners. After heavy fire from the AATs began to harass them, Cody ordered his men to fall back, and the droids pursued them. However, the tactical droid commander TX-20 was alerted to the rescue, and after Obi-Wan managed to destroy the proton cannons with the help of Waxer and Boil, the tactical droid's tank attacked them. Before TX-20 could destroy Obi-Wan and Numa, however, the former Twi'lek prisoners overran the tank and destroyed the droid. Mace and the transports were then able to land, and the Republic forces headed to the capital city of Lessu to retake it and free the planet. Cody and General Kenobi led their forces and took the Jixuan desert, thus securing Ryloth's southern hemisphere for the Republic.\n\n",

After discovering the commando droid, more droids appeared and ambushed them. The two held them off for a brief moment before the droids threw thermal detonators in their direction. Their shuttle was destroyed in the following explosion, but Rex and Cody managed to jump off the platform and employ ascension cables to safely land. After meeting Hevy, Echo and Fives, Cody and Rex learned that they were the only survivors of the invasion, and led the rookie troopers in an attack to retake the base. Upon destroying the droids and regaining control of the station, the group discovered that the all-clear signal had been hot-wired to keep the Republic unsuspecting of a Separatist fleet, led by General Grievous, intent on destroying Kamino and stopping the Republic's production of clones. As droid reinforcements arrived, the clones planned to use multiple explosives and liquid tibanna to destroy the base and stop the all-clear signal, which would alert the Republic to the Separatists' presence. However, after the remote detonator failed to operate, Hevy sacrificed himself, manually activating the detonator and destroying the station. With the all-clear beacon disabled, the Republic fleet arrived in the system and was able to ward off the Separatists.\n\n",

He participated in the First Battle of Geonosis, fighting the Confederacy of Independent Systems' massive force of battle droids. Rex and his clone troopers fought well and earned veteran status in the Republic Army. Throughout the war, Rex's reputation continued to grow, eventually resulting in the captain becoming considered the hero of the clone army. Despite only being a captain, Rex was assigned leadership of the 501st itself. In the aftermath of the Battle of Geonosis, the 501st Clone Battalion was reorganized and sponsored by Republic Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, eventually turning it into the 501st Legion, and placed under the command of the recently-knighted Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, with Rex being assigned as Skywalker's first-in-command.\n\nRex participated in the Battle of Arantara, where he led his soldiers to the frontline without Skywalker. Injured and knocked out, with Rex's armor also damaged in the conflict, Rex's life was in danger until he was saved by Skywalker. Awaking later, Rex expressed surprise that Skywalker had come back for him, to which Skywalker responded that it should have been him in his place and that a leader always leads from the front. Rex soon developed a respect for his general, with Skywalker also quickly coming to respect the captain. The two even became friends. Rex was eager to follow orders early in the war but became less tightly wound in time.\n\nRex also worked alongside Commander Cody at incidents such as Tibrin. He also came to meet and befriend clone commando Gregor. At one point during his service, Rex and his fellow clones encountered dekamites, which they dubbed \"swamp spiders,\" but defeated them. At another point, Rex and other clones were confronting a large force of enemies. The clone captain ordered Squad 2 to pick their targets and, after another clone exclaimed that there were too many opponents, warned Gold Six to watch their stabilizer. Rex also ordered another individual to watch out for what was happening at their left.\n\nRex, Skywalker, and several of his men undertook a mission to Benglor. There, they ran into a creature that ate several droids and clone trooper Bellow. Rex ordered a retreat, but clone trooper Hardcase disobeyed orders and turned his Z-6 rotary blaster cannon on the creature. Skywalker later saved Hardcase.\n\n",

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - The Clone Wars cancellation and revival\n\nFollowing the cancellation of The Clone Wars in 2013, Filoni revealed that he had planned out twelve more episodes that continued Ahsoka's story. He described each four-episode arc at Celebration Europe. With the release of the seventh season of The Clone Wars in 2020, eight of the twelve episodes Filoni mentioned were fully completed.\n\nIn the first arc, Ahsoka would find a new way of life in the underworld of Coruscant and get close to a scoundrel called Nyx Okami. This arc eventually became the seventh season episodes \"Gone with a Trace,\" \"Deal No Deal,\" \"Dangerous Debt,\" and \"Together Again.\" In the final release, several major changes were made to the arc, most notably the replacement of Nyx Okami with the Martez sisters, Trace and Rafa.\n\nThe second arc, which was never completed, would have dealt with Ahsoka helping the Jedi Order and traveling beneath the Jedi Temple to a Sith shrine. The arc begins with Tano returning to warn the Jedi of a threat she discovered in the underworld of Coruscant.\n\nThereafter, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker enlist her help to rescue Yoda from the Sith shrine underground. During this journey, Ahsoka and Anakin would have flown autogyro-style vehicles and encountered large beasts resembling Kaiju. At some point during the arc, Ahsoka would protect the Jedi Holocron Vault from Darth Sidious, who would shoot Force lightning at her through the vault's doors.\n\nThe last planned arc centered around the Siege of Mandalore and was released fully as the episodes \"Old Friends Not Forgotten,\" \"The Phantom Apprentice,\" \"Shattered,\" and \"Victory and Death.\" The color of Ahsoka's lightsabers in this arc changed during development. In the initial story pre-cancellation, the lightsabers were meant to have their original green hue, while the final version released in 2020 had a blue hue, reflecting changes that Anakin Skywalker made while the sabers were in his care. For the character's duel with Maul in the The Clone Wars: Season Seven, stuntwoman Lauren Mary Kim provided motion caption work to portray Tano's acrobatic fighting style.\n\n",

Tano and her allies begin the story by learning a secret droid factory on Geonosis has been activated, kicking off a third battle of Geonosis and forcing the group to unravel who is behind a new Droid Army's creation. In the end, Tano and company would learn it was Maul's doing and engage the former Sith Lord in a battle on Naboo. As part of Infinity's toys-to-life aspect, Tano was given her own figure that could be beamed into the game. In 2023, former Disney Infinity story lead Adrian Ropp revealed he had pushed for Tano to get her own figure despite reluctance on the part of higher-ups.

        "content": "# Ahsoka Tano - Typical garb\n\nWhen she initially became a Padawan, Tano wore a dark red bandeau top and skirt with white tights, along with dark red boots and fingerless gloves, as well as a purple sash. Tano later changed to wearing a dark red backless dress at the same time as she built her second lightsaber, this time with grey tights with diamond-shaped cut-outs and armbands with diamond shapes on her upper arms.\n\nShe also wore a beaded headdress with a Padawan braid made of silka beads behind her right front lekku; after a ceremony on Coruscant, Master Yoda granted her an extension to the braid. The braid was taken away from her on two occasions: once briefly when she was captured by Cad Bane during the Battle of Devaron, and the other when she was expelled from the Jedi after being framed for treason. She was offered the braid back after her name was cleared, but chose to leave the Order instead. Ahsoka also had a wrist-mounted comlink but she had to destroy it to lay low while being on the run.\n\nAfter surviving Order 66, she donned a hood that covered her face and montrals to obscure her identity. During her time on Thabeska and Raada, Tano wore a nondescript outfit, the only clothing she owned at the time. It was occasionally accompanied by hoods that concealed her face, with fellow Togruta Selda giving her a new one that fit her recently grown montrals better. She also owned a disused weapons belt that she put to use again upon constructing her second pair of lightsabers, and was given a backpack on Raada that didn't rub against her lekku.\n\nWhen Tano met the Spectres after the naval action at Mustafar, she wore a grey dress with grey-and-brown armor plating on her chest and skirt, along with grey detached sleeves and forearm armor, as well as fingerless gloves. The outfit also had armored boots.\n\nWhile operating on the planet Corvus during the New Republic Era, Tano wore sleeveless dark blue robes and a large belt from which she hung her lightsabers, as well as a pair of silver vambraces and arm wrappings on her forearms. Tano draped a dark cloak over these clothes during her assault on Calodan. This cloak hid her amid the smog of Corvus and also doubled as a poncho. Although Din Djarin incinerated this cloak upon meeting the Togruta, she replaced it not long after with a similar covering.\n\n",

He was pleased to discover that he would be operating under the command of famed Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, he did not participate in the First Battle of Geonosis. He would later serve under Jedi Master Mace Windu at the Battle of Skor II.\n\nDuring his service to the Republic, Cody saw worlds fall. Several months into the Clone Wars, CC-2224 was temporarily pulled from the fighting in order to be entered into an experimental training regiment, headed by ARC trooper Alpha, designed to provoke independent thought among the enrolled commanders. As a sign of his new-found independent streak, CC-2224 took the name \"Cody,\" and began customizing his armor with equipment previously available only to the ARCs. Cody's armor modifications included a small, bullet-shaped jetpack, a secondary comm antenna, a visor on his helmet, a pair of antennae on his helmet, enlarged shoulder pads, and a small stick-like tool in an armband on his upper right arm.\n\nOf the hundred commanders put through Alpha-17's training program, a handful were picked by Alpha-17 and assigned to Squad Seven, an elite group of cross-trained commandos made up of the Grand Army's best snipers, demolition experts, and marines, whose role was to accompany ranking Jedi on any type of mission. For their stellar performances, Commanders Cody and Odd Ball were given control over Squad Seven, though Major Jorir handled its day-to-day operations.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - The Zygerrian Slave Empire[]\n\nThe Zygerrian slave ship Delta-T-3 transported Rex, Kenobi, and Roshti to the volcanic world of Kadavo, where the Zygerrians maintained a mining complex over a volcanic crater. Rex and the others laid eyes on the population of Kiros, whom Agruss, the keeper of the facility, was subjugating into slavery for processing by the Zygerrian Slave Empire. As part of his welcome for his newest charges, Agruss dropped seven of the Togruta colonists into the crater below, making it clear that the Togruta would suffer for any trace of defiance from Kenobi. Rex and Kenobi were quickly forced into work alongside the Togruta in mining materials at the facility. On one occasion, while Kenobi was commenting to Rex on the state of the despairing Togruta, one of the Zygerrian slave masters interrupted him, whipping Kenobi as punishment for speaking. The Zygerrian then turned his shock whip on a nearby Togruta slave, forcing Kenobi to submit to save the colonist's life. Rex and Kenobi thus realized that the Zygerrians intended to break Kenobi's spirit by punishing the Togruta instead of him. As Rex and Kenobi's days in slavery continued, they were shackled in handcuffs and brought before Agruss in the facility's command center to speak with none other than Count Dooku via holoconnection. Having learned of the Zygerrians' capture of the Jedi, Dooku had ousted an uncooperative Scintel from power and had ordered the immediate execution of Rex and Kenobi.\n\nJust then, the Tecora made an unscheduled landing at the Kadavo mining complex. Aboard were Skywalker, Tano, and R2-D2, who had escaped from Scintel's custody on Zygerria and had come to rescue Rex, Kenobi, and the Togruta. The Zygerrians destroyed the Tecora, though an unfazed Skywalker and Tano began to cut through the facility's outer blast door with their lightsabers. Meanwhile, the Zygerrians rounded up all of the Togruta colonists in a holding cell and prepared to dump them into the crater below if Skywalker did not call off his forces. Nevertheless, Skywalker continued his efforts when his reinforcements arrived: Plo Koon and a Republic Star Destroyer under the command of Admiral Coburn. With the complex under attack by Koon's starfighter forces, Kenobi used the Force to sever his and Rex's shock collars, and the two attacked their Zygerrian captors. Rex disabled his handcuffs with a Zygerrian's electrostaff and took down several slavers on his own, pilfering an electrostaff from one and head-butting another. In response to the outbreak of hostilities, Agruss activated the mechanism that would open the Togruta slaves' holding cell over the crater, jamming the controls so that Rex and Kenobi could not deactivate it.\n\nAs Rex and Kenobi finished off the Zygerrian guards, the cornered Agruss attempted to barter for his life, taunting Kenobi that a Jedi would not kill an unarmed man such as himself. Though Kenobi was unable to pass judgment on him, Agruss failed to account for Rex, who did not share Kenobi's reservations and threw an electrostaff at Agruss. The staff plunged straight through Agruss and the back of his hoverchair, killing him. Rex and Kenobi then left the command center and joined Skywalker out on the landing pad, where Koon's Wolfpack landed an LAAT/i gunship to retrieve them. In the meantime, Coburn took the Arquitens-class light cruiser Hand of Justice to assist Tano in rescuing the Togruta slaves from their holding cell. Once all of the Togruta were safely aboard the Hand of Justice, the Republic's LAAT/i gunships moved in and compromised the building's supports, plunging the entire complex into the crater below. Following the successful rescue, Rex, Skywalker, Tano and Kenobi were taken to Koon's Star Destroyer with the Togruta colonists, who began to receive treatment to recover from their ordeal in enslavement. After receiving Roshti's thanks for their efforts, Rex and Commander Wolffe convened in the main hangar with their Jedi commanders to debrief the operation.",

As Tano led her troops against droid forces, the droid army located and surrounded the Republic position.

        "content": "# Rex - Skirmish on the Rishi Moon[]\n\nRex went with Cody on an inspection tour on the Nu-class transport Obex. After inspecting the tracking station at Pastil, Rex and Cody went to the Rishi Moon station. En route, Rex contacted the station. Rex noticed something odd about the trooper's reluctance to their inspection. After landing, Rex and Cody were greeted by another trooper who said that the base was fine and asked them to leave. Rex demanded to be taken to the sergeant in command after the disguised droid said \"roger roger.\" When the survivors of the station launched a droid attack flare, Rex realized that the clone trooper in front of them was actually a droid and promptly shot it in the head, much to Cody's surprise. Rex told him to relax and removed the clone trooper's helmet, revealing it to be a BX-series droid commando. They then came under attack by more commando droids that cut them off from the Obex. Rex and Cody jumped off the platform as the commando droids threw detonators at them. They used their ascension cables to climb down.\n\nThey met the surviving troopers, Fives, Hevy, and Echo, who at first they ordered to remove their helmets to prove they weren't droids. After removing their helmets, they came under attack by a Rishi eel, but Rex shot it in the eye. Rex marked Echo with the eel's blood and realized that they were \"shinies,\" clones that had not fought before. He wanted to show them a taste of battle and brought them back up to the platform. As they did not have the equipment to bypass the blast doors, Rex devised a plan to act as a malfunctioning droid commando; Cody believed that the plan was absurd, but Rex persuaded the droids inside to open the door. Rex, Cody, and the rest of the clones then stormed the command center, taking out the commando droids. They spotted a Confederate fleet approaching, but were unable to contact the Republic.\n\nWhen a landing craft came down, Rex said they would blow up the station so that the Republic fleet would arrive to investigate. Rex rigged the gas detonators as Cody and others held up the battle droids. However, the remote detonator was not working. Rex and the others left while Hevy fixed the detonator. However, Hevy refused to leave, intending to set the gas off manually. Rex and the others tried to go back for him, but Hevy blew up the station along with himself. Rex and the others were rescued by a gunship. After Echo and Fives received medals for their bravery, Rex accepted them into the 501st Legion.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Training the Onderon rebels[]\n\nIn 20 BBY, as the Clone Wars entered their third year, Rex accompanied Kenobi to the Jedi Temple to watch a sparring duel between Jedi Master Quinlan Vos and a Jedi Knight. New orders came in soon enough for Rex when the High Council received a plea for aid from the Onderon rebels, a grass-roots insurgency based on the planet Onderon. Despite their world's alignment with the Confederacy, the rebels refused to recognize the legitimacy of their Separatist-loyal monarch, King Sanjay Rash, and sought to deliver Onderon from battle droid occupation. Instead of direct intervention by way of the Grand Army, Skywalker developed the idea of sponsoring training for the local rebels, the objective being to teach them self-sufficiency while also engaging the Separatists on another front. Rex joined Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi as the fourth member of the team of advisors who would be instructing the rebels. Once they had prepared for the journey to Onderon, Lieutenant Hawk transported them to the night side of Onderon aboard the Republic shuttle Valkyrie 2929, hovering over the drop zone in the Onderonian jungle long enough for Rex and his robed Jedi comrades to reach the ground via a jetpack and the Force, respectively. They were soon found by a dalgo-back patrol of guerrillas led by the young Steela Gerrera, who took Rex and the others to the insurgency's secret base a half-kilometer to the east.\n\nRex and his comrades arrived at the rebel camp at daybreak, at which point Steela introduced them to her brother, Saw, the self-proclaimed leader of the insurgency. Among the other rebels was Lux Bonteri, the quondam senator of Onderon and an old friend of Tano. Skywalker and Kenobi wasted no time in launching the insurgency's training, calling a gathering to introduce themselves to their new trainees. After Rex took a group of volunteers to retrieve supplies from their entry point, the Jedi decided to begin with a session on countering an Armored Assault Tank, a common sight amidst the Separatists' forward infantry. Using a captured tank as a visual aid, Tano laid out the vehicle's schematics to their rebel trainees, explaining that both the top and front hatches had to be disabled to fully immobilize the tank. As a demonstration, Rex, taking an EMP grenade in each hand, tossed one charge into the front cabin and then swung onto the main cannon to reach the topside chamber. He somersaulted off the tank a moment before it was disabled by the combined electromagnetic pulse. To practice the maneuver, Skywalker organized the rebels into teams of two, as each soldier would be able to target a separate port. Although the first pair, Saw and Bonteri, botched their attempt when the latter lost his hold on the main turret, Rex kept the exercise moving, supplying the next few groups with EMP grenades. He rallied each pair through the drill, treating them as soldiers and pushing them to give it their all.\n\nIn the next lesson, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi taught the insurgents how to disable a shielded droideka. Controlling three reprogrammed units from a wrist remote, Rex activated the shield of one of the sample droidekas, then released several blaster shots at the shield to demonstrate its ability to repel high-velocity attacks. Tano presented the solution to the shield: a stationary or slow-moving object, such as a carefully tossed EMP grenade, one of which she lobbed through the shield, deactivating the destroyer droid. When it was time for the rebels to conduct the exercise, only Bonteri mastered it on the first try. Rex broke the soldiers into pairs for further practice, in which others, including Saw, were able to perfect the maneuver. Following that, the Jedi moved on to firearm practice, with Steela exemplifying her natural abilities with a sniper rifle. Rex made sure to inform the rebels that a headshot was the only effective way to deactivate a battle droid, as the enemy units would otherwise continue relaying intelligence to central command. At that point, the insurgency's training escalated into full-blown combat, as a patrol of droids stormed out of the surrounding trees to quash the fledgling rebellion. Rex shouted for everyone to take cover as enemy rockets and cannonades began to fly into the camp.",

        "content": "# Rex - Against General Krell[]\n\nDogma raised his blaster at his fellow troopers, who did the same to him, but Dogma's uncertainty with his own position grew when Rex told him that they were not mindless, obedient soldiers\u2014they were more than droids, and they had a duty to make their own decisions when faced with ill-natured orders. Dogma hesitated, then lowered his blaster, and several other troopers subdued him. Ordering that Dogma be taken to the prison block, Rex led the remainder of his men into the jungle after Krell, splitting them into groups to search for their rogue general. After a while, Rex checked with the other squads to see if anyone had found any sign of Krell. One of the other units had encountered him, and Fives spotted them up ahead, but all of them fell to Krell's blades. Approaching Rex and his squad, Krell jumped into the trees and used the Force to magnify his voice, taunting the clone troopers and their loyalty to him. Krell then revealed himself and attacked, dealing a great number of losses. While Rex tried to hold the line with Fives and their rapidly diminishing troops, he was contacted via comlink by Tup, who had a plan to defeat Krell that required the general being lured toward him. Rex observed Tup's request to trust him and ordered everyone to circle around Krell and lead him in Tup's direction. They soon saw Tup's idea: to maneuver Krell into the waiting tentacles of a ravenous vixus, a threat that even the Jedi Master did not expect to encounter.\n\nTup succeeded, and although the hungry creature did not digest Krell, he was left winded upon breaking free of its tentacles. Tup killed the vixus and stunned Krell at point-blank range, and Rex congratulated the rookie trooper on his canniness. Locked in a set of binders, Krell was brought back to the airbase, where Rex and his men installed him in a detention cell adjacent to Dogma's. Confronting the shackled Krell, Rex discovered that the Jedi Master had fallen to the dark side. Krell had foreseen that the Jedi were going to lose the Clone Wars and strove to become Count Dooku's new apprentice, intending to curry favor with the Sith Lord by driving the Republic from Umbara. Although Rex refused to let Krell's ambitious plans come to fruition, the Jedi Master believed that the Umbarans would soon retake the airbase, at which point the Separatists would set him free. Troubled by their deposed general's resolve, Rex, Fives, Jesse, and Tup returned to ground level, where they witnessed bombings overhead from the Umbarans' long-range missiles. Appo reported to Rex that the command center's transmitter had been repaired, as it had been offline not due to enemy interference, but because of sabotage. Appo went on to convey that Kenobi's forces had conquered the capital city, though the remaining Umbarans were now regrouping to retake the airbase. Rex ordered Appo to mobilize all of their men on the perimeter in preparation for what looked to be a full-scale enemy assault.\n\nRex realized that Krell, having sabotaged the transmitter, had been against the clone troopers from the beginning, leading Fives to conclude that if the Umbarans took custody of Krell, he would betray all of the Republic intelligence in his possession. Jesse and Tup agreed that they had to do something to silence Krell, and Rex reluctantly conceded that they would have to execute him. The captain returned to the prison block with Fives and Jesse to carry out the task at hand. While Fives brought Dogma out of his cell, Rex told Krell to turn around and step toward the back wall, then ordered him onto his knees. He drew one of his blaster pistols and had Jesse deactivate the shielded door of Krell's cell. Despite the necessity of executing the Jedi Master to prevent his information from falling into Separatist hands, Rex hesitated with killing an unarmed Jedi, even in spite of his crimes against the 501st and the 212th. Krell sensed his hesitation and savored his fear, calling out the captain on his inability to deliver the killing shot. In the end, the fatal shot came not from Rex, but from Dogma, who had lifted one of Fives' blaster pistols. Having been one of Krell's most ardent supporters, Dogma had consequently been devastated by his betrayal.",

        "content": "# Rex - The shadows of Umbara[]\n\nIn late 21 BBY, a major point of contention in the war became the planet Umbara, whose Umbaran people had recently seceded from the Republic and were arming the Confederacy with their extremely advanced military weaponry. The Republic responded to Umbara's defection by sending a full invasion force from the Grand Army to conquer the strategic Umbara system, which was located in the Expansion Region's remote Ghost Nebula. As part of the numerous units dispatched to Umbara, Rex and the 501st Legion joined Skywalker and Kenobi aboard one of the Republic fleet's lead Acclamator-class transports. After Tano and Barriss Offee breached the Separatist blockade of Umbara, Skywalker and Kenobi's assault ship moved in on the Shadow World, so named because the Ghost Nebula eternally shrouded it in night. While their troops prepared to land on Umbara, Skywalker and Kenobi held a briefing in the hangar bay with Rex, Cody, and other troopers to outline the plan for capturing the capital city. Jedi Generals Saesee Tiin and Pong Krell would be supporting Kenobi and Cody's battle group in their attack on the Umbaran capital from the south, while Rex, Skywalker, and the 501st Legion were tasked with intercepting enemy reinforcements to the north of the city. Opposing the Republic forces would be the heavily armed Umbaran Soldiers of the Umbaran militia.\n\nRex was pleased to learn that he and Skywalker would be assisted by an old friend, Advanced Recon Commando Fives, who was on special assignment to the 501st for the campaign. Once all of the Republic forces were ready for deployment, the Jedi and clones began their landing, taking space gunships to the planetary surface. Lieutenant Hawk piloted Rex, Skywalker, Fives, and some of the 501st troops\u2014including veterans Hardcase and Jesse and new generation recruits Dogma and CT-5385, nicknamed \"Tup\"\u2014through the atmosphere's thick fog, with clone Z-95 starfighters providing support against enemy Umbaran starfighters. When the gunships were met with dense surface cannon-fire from the Umbaran militia, Hawk struggled to reach the predetermined landing site through the difficult conditions. After All Terrain Recon Transports and 501st AT-RT drivers were deployed to secure the landing zone against approaching Umbaran Soldiers and Umbaran hover tanks, Hawk brought Rex, Skywalker, and their men to the drop site, where they joined the battle and led the 501st Legion's charge on the Umbaran lines. During their advance, Rex took notice of a nearby ridge, which Skywalker elected to claim for use as a staging area.\n\nThe Umbarans and their hover tanks were relentless in defending their positions, and Umbaran starfighters proved an even greater danger, executing strafing runs on the 501st troops. Even with the added threat of an esurient vixus creature, Rex and his men prevailed, taking the ridge and converting it into a temporary post. While monitoring the ongoing battle's progress from the trenches along the ridge, Skywalker noted that Kenobi's battalion was nearing the capital. However, the interlude in fighting did not last long, as Umbaran Soldiers had infiltrated the thick foliage behind the 501st lines to catch them off-guard. One of the enemy soldiers released a small but lethal millicreep droid, and the Umbarans took advantage of the clones' following distraction to ambush them. In the ensuing engagement, Skywalker cut through the millicreep, while Rex called in an airstrike on the enemy's position. Seeing an opening to the south of the ridge, Rex advised that they move their men off the ridge in case the airstrike overshot, and Skywalker heeded his captain's advice. While Skywalker defended their flank, Rex led the 501st platoons out of the trenches to take cover amidst the scattered vegetation just below the hill. They were glad that they had done so, for a pair of BTL-B Y-wing starfighters arrived only moments later.",

        "content": "# Rex - The Zygerrian Slave Empire[]\n\nWhen Supreme Chancellor Palpatine became the target of a Separatist kidnapping plot, Rex and some of his men from the 501st were assigned to be bodyguards for him, serving as extra security at the Chancellor's Suite on Coruscant. Meanwhile, the Jedi High Council authorized an operation to infiltrate the enemy plot. The sniper Rako Hardeen was allowed to appear to kill Kenobi, who then went undercover as Hardeen to gain the trust of Moralo Eval, the mastermind behind the conspiracy. After learning from Palpatine that Hardeen\u2014actually Kenobi in disguise\u2014had escaped to the planet Nal Hutta with Eval and Cad Bane, Skywalker went after the sniper who had murdered his former Master, while Rex and two of his soldiers remained behind to guard Palpatine. That night, Mace Windu contacted Rex via the latter's Imagecaster and asked for Skywalker, who had failed to respond to his calls. Although Rex tried to hide his general's unsanctioned departure from the capital, Palpatine revealed that he had personally sent Skywalker to Nal Hutta, believing that the High Council should have more faith in Skywalker and his abilities. Palpatine ended the exchange with Windu by informing Rex that he was withdrawing for the night, and Rex and his men escorted him back to his apartment. Thanks to Kenobi's undercover efforts, the Jedi Order thwarted the kidnapping plot two days later at the Festival of Light on Naboo, preventing Eval and Bane from capturing Palpatine.",

        "content": "# Rex - The Zygerrian Slave Empire[]\n\nAlthough the Republic succeeded in securing Kiros, a planetary bioscan conducted by Admiral Yularen revealed that the Togruta colonists, all 50,000 of them, had completely vanished from their world. When Skywalker and Tano interrogated him, D'Nar revealed that the Zygerrian queen was reviving the Zygerrian Slave Empire of old, a slave-trading government that had prospered for centuries before the Jedi Order had dismantled it, forcing its slave trade to fester in the criminal underworld. The Togruta were to be auctioned off into slavery on Zygerria, but the Jedi were determined to prevent the colonists from becoming slaves. To that end, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi took the Tecora to Zygerria, where they intended to infiltrate the Slave Empire and locate the missing Togruta. En route to the Zygerria system, Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi assumed uniforms to pose as Zygerrian slave traders, while Tano masqueraded as a Togruta slave. After landing at a Zygerrian slave market, Rex and his comrades set off on their mission. While Skywalker distracted the Zygerrian queen, Miraj Scintel, Rex and Kenobi were to find the Togruta colonists. Splitting up from Skywalker and Tano, whom Prime Minister Atai Molec escorted to the Zygerrian Royal Palace, Rex and Kenobi proceeded to the Royal Palace's outdoor slave cells, where they discovered only one Togruta prisoner, an ailing Governor Roshti of Kiros.\n\nWith royal Zygerrian guards patrolling the compound, Rex kept watch for Kenobi to retrieve Roshti, who was too weak to reveal anything about the whereabouts of the other missing Togruta. Recognizing the need to spirit Roshti away from the Royal Palace, Kenobi commandeered a brezak lizard mount from a Zygerrian guard and helped Rex bring Roshti onto the creature's back. As other Zygerrian guards in the vicinity caught sight and ordered them to stop, Rex took up the brezak's reins and steered their mount for the other end of the compound. However, a Zygerrian guard shot Kenobi in the shoulder, and both he and Roshti fell off the brezak. Rex was forced to leave them behind and escaped while Kenobi and Roshti were captured. That evening, Rex proceeded to the royal auction house to provide support for Skywalker and Tano at Queen Scintel's Royal Slave Auction, in which the Togruta colonists were to be sold into slavery. While a Zygerrian auctioneer introduced the recaptured Roshti as a sample of the Togruta, Rex caught the eye of Skywalker, who was with Tano and Scintel in the queen's private viewing box, and showed him his acquired Zygerrian blaster rifle as a gesture of being ready for action. However, Rex and his comrades were met with a grim surprise when Kenobi was brought out onto the auction block as a \"special guest\" of the queen.\n\nDenouncing the Jedi as slaves to a corrupt Republic Senate, Scintel ordered Skywalker to whip Kenobi to teach the Jedi Master his place. Just as he activated his shock whip, Skywalker checked that both Rex and Tano were prepared for action, then joined Kenobi in attacking the Zygerrian guards on the auction block. As the guards in the stands opened fire on his comrades below, Rex disarmed one of the Zygerrians and shot at another group of them, exploding that part of the floor. With two blaster rifles in hand, he was stopped by a trio of royal guards and was then attacked from behind by another. Both Rex and his assailant fell out of the stands, landing on the ground several stories below. Before Rex had much time to recover, Scintel sent in reinforcements to subdue the infiltrators. The touch of a shock whip electrified Rex into unconsciousness, and Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi were similarly defeated. The Zygerrians sent all four of them into slavery: While Scintel forced Skywalker to become her personal bodyguard, Rex and the others became her leverage to keep Skywalker in his place. Tano was imprisoned outside the Royal Palace, and Rex and Kenobi, fitted with shock collars, were meanwhile sent to be processed as slaves with Roshti.",

With the rest of the droid commandos disabled, Rex and his team headed for the locked door at the bottom of the stairwell. He had explosive charges placed to blow open the door, with Dogma again tossing an EMP grenade through the rupture. On the other side, Rex smartly gunned down a droid commando that tried to pounce on them from the ceiling. He and his comrades were relieved to find Palola, Oz, and the other five hostages safe with minimal injuries.\n\nAlthough Rex was about to radio the gunship for an immediate retrieval, he instead decided to act on Palola's findings, confirming from the Lorrdian that their tactical droid captor was headquartered in the nearby granary.

He and the others then returned to Torrent Company's base.

Unable to go after Gregor himself, Rex instead contacted the Bad Batch as they traveled through hyperspace on a mission for Scaleback. After asking the commandos to liberate his friend but realizing he needed to cut his transmission short, Rex sent them Gregor's signal and ended his call.\n\nIn the ensuing debate amongst the Bad Batch, Echo remained steadfast in his devotion to help his former captain, understanding that Rex would only contact them if it was important. Although it meant they may not get paid by Scaleback for their current mission, the squad ultimately decided to travel to Daro, where Echo, Tech, and Hunter departed from the Marauder. After analyzing the Imperial base they needed to break into, Hunter realized that the odds were against them, making him consider leaving and telling Rex that the mission was not possible. However, Echo implored Hunter and Tech to continue the mission, remembering their mission to Skako Minor to rescue him. Convinced, the three broke into the facility and rescued Gregor, who trusted them upon learning Rex had sent them, but Hunter was ultimately left behind and captured by the Empire.\n\nLeaving the injured Gregor on Ord Mantell with Scaleback, the Bad Batch traveled to Kamino to rescue Hunter, ultimately learning he was being held by Crosshair in the Tipoca City Training Facility. Ordering Omega to stay behind with droid AZI-345211896246498721347, Echo instructed her to return to the Marauder and contact Rex if they sent her a warning signal. Upon receiving the signal, she instead decided to activate training droids, which freed the Bad Batch and allowed them to capture Crosshair.

        "content": "# Rex - The mystery of Tup and Fives[]\n\nFollowing the Battle of Ringo Vinda, Rex and the 501st returned to Coruscant. In the intervening time, Tup died after a tumor was removed from his brain due to Fives' intervention. After disobeying orders and evading arrest on Kamino, Fives discovered that the tumor was actually an inhibitor chip\u2014an inorganic cerebral implant that the Kaminoans had inserted into all of the clone troopers at the embryonic stage. In Tup's case, his inhibitor chip had corroded and malfunctioned, leading to his unstable behavior. Upon arriving on Coruscant with Ti to plead his case to Chancellor Palpatine, Fives allegedly attempted to assassinate Palpatine and escaped into the lower levels of the ecumenopolis. Following Fives' getaway, the entirety of Coruscant's security and clone trooper forces were allocated to a manhunt for the rogue ARC trooper, but Jedi involvement was not requested. As a result, Skywalker volunteered to head the Order's undercover investigation into the matter, with Rex joining his Jedi General in the search for Fives. According to Ti, Fives believed that he was the victim of a conspiracy, Separatist or otherwise. Ti also warned Skywalker that since Fives had extracted his inhibitor chip\u2014as he had done for Tup\u2014his behavior might be as erratic as that of his late comrade.\n\nRex and Skywalker soon received a promising lead in the form of a communiqu\u00e9 from Kix, who had run into Fives at the clone sports bar known as 79's. Kix relayed a set of coordinates where Fives had requested a meeting with Rex and, by extension, Skywalker. Rex and Skywalker took a police gunship to the specified location, a portal warehouse on Level 1325. After disembarking, Rex and Skywalker warily entered the darkened warehouse, blaster pistols drawn and lightsaber ignited, respectively. Inside the building, they called out to Fives, who responded by thanking them for trusting him and then asked them to drop their weapons. Once Fives said he was unarmed, Rex and Skywalker complied, setting down their weaponry on a nearby crate. However, Fives, appearing disheveled and deranged, did not emerge from the shadows until he had trapped the pair in a ray shield. The beleaguered clone appealed to his irate comrades that he did not have a choice, saying he had been framed because he had uncovered a massive deception, the scope of which reached the highest echelons of the Republic. Fives claimed that the inhibitor chip in every clone trooper would even make them follow orders to kill the Jedi\u2014as Tup had done to Tiplar.\n\nRex and Skywalker did not know how to react to Fives' improbable claims, and their visible skepticism left Fives frustrated with their lack of belief in him. After Skywalker asked Fives to come with them, Rex assured Fives that they were listening to him and that their only intention was to provide help. Nevertheless, Fives refused, claiming that Palpatine would kill him. Fives implicated the Supreme Chancellor in the conspiracy, an allegation that Skywalker refuted without a second's hesitation. At that moment, Commander Fox and a contingent of Coruscant Guard shock troopers stormed into the warehouse, having pinpointed Fives' location via a probe droid. Although Fox ordered Fives to surrender, the rogue ARC trooper refused to do so and seized one of Rex's blaster pistols from the adjacent crate. Before Fives could fire his pilfered blaster, Fox shot first. Aghast, Rex and Skywalker watched from the inside of the ray shield as Fives collapsed to the floor, clutching at the lethal wound to his chest that Fox had inflicted. Once one of the shock troopers disabled the shield at Skywalker's behest, Rex rushed to Fives' side, shouting that he needed a medic, but it was too late. Fives told Rex that the conspiracy was larger than anyone could have imagined, and his dying words made mention to a mission and nightmares that, for him, were finally over. Rex was devastated by the loss of his longtime comrade. All of Fox's Coruscant Guard troopers took off their helmets in honor of the fallen soldier.",

        "content": "# Rex - A new life[]\n\nAs they had dug the graves, Rex and Tano agreed to part ways, but both informed the other they would head into the chaos of the Outer Rim Territories. However, they first traveled to Naboo, where Senator Padme Amidala's funeral was being held. Rex remained with the Y-wing while Tano infiltrated Theed and attended the funeral incognito. She managed to avoid discovery and returned to Rex without incident, after which they departed the planet.\n\nAfter parting ways with his former Commander, Rex was able to keep a low profile due to Imperial records listing him as having been killed in action even though Tano was presumed to have survived. Rex returned to Saleucami to meet with his old friend Cut Lawquane and his family. He informed them about Order 66 and the inhibitor chips before moving on, not revealing where he was going. Clone Force 99 arrived at the Lawquane farmstead the following day, where Cut informed them of his appearance and statements, information that was of great importance particularly to Rex's old comrade Echo. Deciding to fight for what remained of the Republic and to help his clone siblings, Rex made it his mission to strike against the Empire and help his fellow clones where he could, forming his own resistance and clone-help network, the Clone Underground.\n\nHe recruited Trace and Rafa Martez\u2014two sisters whom Tano had befriended prior to the Siege of Mandalore\u2014to his new movement, and the rebuilt R7-A7 came into the sister's possession as well. Understanding that the data collected by a Separatist tactical droid would be useful against Imperial tactics, Rex tasked the Martez sisters and R7 with retrieving the head of a T-series unit in a decommissioning facility on Corellia. Upon infiltrating the facility, the Martez sisters met the members of the Bad Batch, who had remained mostly unaffected by Order 66 and had begun to perform mercenary work for the Trandoshan Ciddarin Scaleback. Although the droid head was destroyed in the skirmish, Hunter gifted the sisters a copy of its data before parting ways. Contacting Rex once they were in space, the sisters informed him via hologram that their mission was a success and that they knew the location of a rogue clone squad.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Joining the Rebellion[]\n\nEventually, Rex met with Commander Wolffe, the former commander of Wolfpack, and Gregor, and the trio began living in a modified AT-TE on the desert planet of Seelos.\n\nSeveral years prior to the Battle of Yavin, Tano tried to contact Rex, but her transmissions had gone unanswered since Wolffe had hidden their existence from Rex, fearing that the Empire would come for them if they were found colluding with a former Jedi. When Rex was unresponsive, Tano sent a group of rebels that included the Great Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice Ezra Bridger to find Rex and obtain information from him on abandoned bases that the growing rebellion could use in their struggle against the Empire.\n\nRex and his comrades' first encounter with the Ghost rebels almost ended in violence when Kanan thought the clone troopers were a threat and ignited his lightsaber. Rex's timely intervention broke up the fight between his comrades and Kanan. When Kanan's apprentice Ezra mentioned that he and his rebel companions had been sent by Ahsoka, Rex quickly realized that the rebels were friends and introduced himself and his companions. While meeting with the rebels inside the walker, Ezra tried to convince Rex and his companions to join the fight against the Empire. Rex laughed and declined, saying that his days as a soldier were over. After discussions with Kanan, Rex agreed to create a list of bases that the rebels could use but invited the four rebels to participate in a hunt for joopas as payment for supplying them with this information.\n\nTo allay Kanan's distrust of clone troopers, Rex revealed that he, Gregor, and Wolffe had managed to remove their control chips. The rebels reluctantly participated in the joopa hunt with the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios acting as both the \"hunter\" and the \"bait.\" Zeb was swallowed by the joopa but succeeded in killing the creature. Having completed their side of the deal, Kanan wanted his rebel companions to leave but Rex invited them to stay for dinner. While dining, the Mandalorian teenager Sabine Wren discovered that Wolffe had secretly alerted the Empire to their presence and hid the messages that Ahsoka had sent them.\n\nWolffe, who distrusted the Jedi, had informed the Empire in the mistaken belief that he was protecting himself and his fellow clones. Rex was shocked by this revelation and confronted Wolffe. He convinced Wolffe that the rebels were their friends and that the Empire was their enemy. Shortly thereafter, the clones and rebels were visited by an Imperial probe droid which damaged their auxiliary ship, the Phantom; preventing them from rendezvousing with their fellow crew aboard the Ghost, which was waiting in space. After destroying the probe droid, Rex and his companions prepared for the arrival of the Empire.\n\nDespite Ezra's efforts to encourage Rex and his companions to join the Rebellion, Rex was adamant that the clones would stay behind to hold back the Empire while the rebels escaped on the Phantom. A force of AT-AT walkers led by the Imperial Security Bureau agent Alexsandr Kallus, a perennial foe of the Ghost crew, landed on Seelos. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Rex and his fellow clones stood their ground. At the urging of Ezra, the rebels intervened in the fight and defeated the Imperials. Without air support, Kallus and his surviving AT-AT pilots were forced to retreat into the desert. Honored that Kanan and Ezra would return to save them, Rex and his comrades saluted the Jedi and agreed to join the Rebellion. Meanwhile, Gregor and Wolffe stayed behind and turned the remaining AT-AT into their new home.\n\nHera then arrived with the Ghost to pick them up. Later, the rebels returned to meet Ahsoka and revealed that Rex had joined them. Rex proudly strode forward, and Tano smiled as she walked up to him. Rex playfully joked that she had gotten old, and after Tano smiled that it had to happen sometime, she embraced her old friend. Rex returned the hug warmly.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Wits versus discipline[]\n\nAfter joining the Rebellion, Rex became part of the Phoenix rebel cell, which operated a fleet in space. At some point after joining the rebels, Rex piloted a TIE fighter that had been captured by the Spectres sometime prior. The fighter had been repainted by Wren and was used by Rex in combat, firing its cannons. During one of Ezra's levitation lessons, Rex exposed Sabine and Chopper's trick that involved locking the astromech droid Chopper's feet to the floor, preventing Ezra from levitating him. When Ezra was upset about the trick, Rex told the young Padawan about how a Jedi General he had once fought alongside became a great warrior by combining the Force with his wits. In response, Kanan told Rex that the boy had a lot of wits but needed more discipline.\n\nWhile Rex and Kanan argued about how to train Ezra, the young Padawan sneaked away with Sabine, Chopper, and Zeb on a mission to salvage supplies from an Old Republic medical base. Rex had provided the rebels with the codes to this station. Unknown to the rebels, two Inquisitors known as the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother were waiting for them. The rebels barely escaped with their lives. Rex was present with Kanan and Hera when the younger rebels returned with news that the Empire had more Inquisitors.\n\nLater, Rex oversaw target practice with Ezra, who was using a DC-15A blaster carbine to try and hit a stormtrooper helmet that Chopper was moving around. Kanan came out, sternly reminding Ezra about his Jedi training, which sparked a minor debate between Rex and Kanan until Sabine informed them that Hera had called for a mandatory group meeting. The rebels then participated in a mission to scour Garel City for power generators and Fuel Cells to alleviate an energy crisis on the planet Rinn.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - War of loyalties[]\n\nDuring the war, Rex swore to protect all Republic citizens from harm, including the ill-advised Chairman Chi Cho. At the Battle of Orto Plutonia, Rex knew that his men were risking their lives because of Cho's foolishness, but he nevertheless respected Cho's authority. Yet for all his wartime service, Rex's challenges were not only posed by his enemies. His loyalties and resolve were tested multiple times simply from his battlefield career. While he was aware that he and his clone brothers had been bred to fight for the Republic without a choice, he made the best of the situation. He knew that the politics and ideology of fighting were beyond his influence and instead focused on the day-to-day activities of looking out for his brothers in arms. When it came down to the nature of his commitment, it was not his relentless Kaminoan training or his loyalty to the Republic, but his dedication to his soldiers and Jedi officers that kept him in service. His compassion and selflessness as a commander was evidenced at Kothlis when, despite being severely injured, his first concern was for the welfare of his troops and comrades, not his own. His loyalty was so potent that even if he had not been born to serve, he could not imagine the prospect of abandoning his brothers and friends.\n\nOver time, Rex learned to cope with his doubts about his origins as a clone trooper. Whenever the morality behind his manufactured birth was tested and his indoctrinated loyalty to the Jedi and the Republic challenged, he recalled that the men under his command depended on him to lead them\u2014and that he would never be able to fight for the Republic if he questioned or scrutinized his birth's ethics. In that way, Rex put aside his insecurities for the greater good of the Republic. His strong loyalty to the Republic and the Jedi came into stark contrast with Sergeant Slick's hatred of the Jedi and betrayal of his comrades during the Battle of Christophsis. Rex had no respect for traitors like Slick and was visibly unsettled with Slick's perspective that the clone troopers were slaves to their Jedi commanders. Despite Slick's claim that he had been striking a blow for all clones, Rex drew the conclusion that the sergeant's actions\u2014particularly putting his brothers' lives at risk by performing espionage for the Separatists\u2014evidenced that he did not love and care for them as he so believed.\n\nRex's commitment to the Republic remained undeterred during his later encounter with the clone deserter Cut Lawquane, who had left the Grand Army relatively early on in the war. After first meeting Lawquane, Rex displayed a lack of patience for those who would abandon their duty, and he made his contempt for the deserter known. Once he had assumed a more respectful attitude toward Lawquane, Rex maintained that his beliefs had not been programmed into him, as Lawquane suggested, and that they were undeniably his own. He believed that his military service made him part of the most pivotal moment in the Republic's history and that the Grand Army's failure to defeat the Confederacy would mean the insurrection of an inconceivable evil. Despite disagreeing with Lawquane's outlook and disapproval of the war, Rex came to respect Lawquane as possessing a different type of loyalty\u2014not to the Republic, but to his adopted family. Adding to his grudging but sincere regard for Lawquane was the deserter's brave effort to safeguard his family from invading droid commandos. When the time came to end his stay with Lawquane's family, Rex forwent his initial adamancy on turning in the fugitive Lawquane, opting not to report him as a deserter. He concluded that Lawquane was certainly not a coward and, before departing, politely refused his offer of a place at his farm.\n\nAs the Clone Wars continued, Rex feared that the Republic was beginning to view the clone troopers as a deindividualized, disposable army. He nevertheless upheld the mindset that the clone troopers' responsibility was to carry out and die for their missions when necessary. As he argued with Fives during the Battle of Umbara, that belief stemmed from his own code, not from the Kaminoans engineering him to think as such. In spite of his doubts about the clones' place in the Republic, he preserved his belief in the system for which he and his men were fighting. He held that the clone troopers were not independent of one another, that they were part of something larger than themselves, and it was thus not up to them to disobey orders in favor of strategies that they deemed more effective. Yet he was forced to draw the line when his loyalty to orders required that he see out General Pong Krell's decree to execute troopers Fives and Jesse for insubordination. Rex consequently realized that in some cases, it was necessary to make one's own decisions instead of blindly following orders like battle droids. Although he retained his loyalty to the Republic despite the incident with Krell, the Battle of Umbara left a lasting impression on his outlook as a clone trooper. In the face of so many casualties, he questioned the point of the war and wondered what would happen to the clones when the conflict ended, when they would no longer be needed as soldiers to fight the Clone Wars.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Rescuing Echo[]\n\nAfter the Separatist Admiral Trench made advances against Republic forces during the Battle of Anaxes, Rex theorized that the Separatists had captured his comrade Echo, who was presumed dead, and that the Separatists were combating his strategies through him. Rex and Commander Cody joined forces with an elite squad called Clone Force 99 (known as the \"Bad Batch\"); which consisted of Sergeant Hunter, the giant demolitions expert Wrecker, the sniper Crosshair, and the equipment specialist Tech. The clones raided a Separatist Cyber Center on Anaxes and discovered that it was receiving an audio signal from Skako Minor that was beeping Echo's clone trooper number. This confirmed Rex's suspicions that Echo might still be alive.\n\nArmed with this information, Rex traveled to Skako Minor with Clone Force 99 and Anakin Skywalker on the Marauder. Before going, however, Skywalker spoke with his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and had Rex stand by to make sure no one knew. Although General Kenobi asked where Skywalker was, Rex tried to lie about what his General was doing. After Skywalker was done speaking with her, he and Rex left for Skako with the Bad Batch. After landing, Skywalker was kidnapped by a large flying reptile called a keeradak which deposited him in a Poletec village. Rex and the Bad Batch traveled to the Poletec village where they made peace with the villagers and convinced them to release Skywalker. With the aid of Poletec scouts, the clones and Skywalker traveled to the Techno Union city of Purkoll. During the journey, the clone troopers traced Echo's signal. When Crosshair disdainfully said that Echo was \"just another reg,\" Rex attacked the commando. Anakin broke up the fight and dismissed the others to counsel Rex alone, saying that he had to face the reality that Echo may be dead. Rex told his general that he tried never to dwell on the death on a friend and brother, but that he was certain that he had heard Echo.\n\nThe clones traced Echo's signal to a tower and infiltrated it. Inside, they received a hologram message from the Techno Union leader Wat Tambor, who announced that he had used the algorithm to lure them into a trap. When Tambor charged them with violating the Techno Union's neutrality, Rex responded that Tambor had already breached the Union's neutrality by bringing a Republic prisoner to Skako Minor. Tambor sent several D1-series aerial battle droids to attack them, but the clones and Skywalker defeated them. Rex and Tech forced their way inside a stasis chamber and found Echo. Echo was alive, but many of his body parts had been replaced with prosthetics, and he was kept in an induced coma.\n\nRex and Tech freed Echo from the chamber after some difficulty. However, the clones and Skywalker were surrounded by Techno Union forces and unable to call for help since they were on an unsanctioned mission. When Tambor dispatched a Decimator to destroy the intruders, Rex, the other clones, and Skywalker fled through an exhaust pipe. Wrecker then planted several detonators which destroyed the Decimator and the chamber. While crossing a pipe, the clones and Skywalker escaped on four-winged Keeradaks and returned to the Poletec village.\n\nAt the village, the clones, Skywalker, and the Poletec villagers joined forces to destroy several D-wing droids and octuptarra tri-droids that Tambor had dispatched after them. During the battle, Rex disabled one octuptarra by firing into its eye sensor. Following the battle, Echo thanked Rex for returning for him, but Rex simply stated that it was what brothers did and apologized for the time it took. Rex also expressed his hope that things would be just like their old times together. The clones and Skywalker then headed back to Anaxes.\n\nAfter returning to Anaxes, Echo devised a plan which involved infiltrating Admiral Trench's dreadnought and feeding the Separatist systems with false information in order to secure a Republic victory on Anaxes. Rex, Echo, Skywalker, and Force 99 infiltrated Trench's warship using the Marauder while Republic forces under Jedi Generals Windu and Kenobi attacked the Separatist assembly plant. The clones and Skywalker infiltrated the dreadnought's interface unit and fed false information to Admiral Trench. Echo brought all Separatist forces to the assembly plant and then used a feedback pulse to shut them down.",

When it came down to the nature of his commitment, it was not his relentless Kaminoan training or his loyalty to the Republic, but his dedication to his soldiers and Jedi officers that kept him in service. His compassion and selflessness as a commander was evidenced at Kothlis when, despite being severely injured, his first concern was for the welfare of his troops and comrades, not his own. His loyalty was so potent that even if he had not been born to serve, he could not imagine the prospect of abandoning his brothers and friends.\n\nOver time, Rex learned to cope with his doubts about his origins as a clone trooper. Whenever the morality behind his manufactured birth was tested and his indoctrinated loyalty to the Jedi and the Republic challenged, he recalled that the men under his command depended on him to lead them\u2014and that he would never be able to fight for the Republic if he questioned or scrutinized his birth's ethics. In that way, Rex put aside his insecurities for the greater good of the Republic. His strong loyalty to the Republic and the Jedi came into stark contrast with Sergeant Slick's hatred of the Jedi and betrayal of his comrades during the Battle of Christophsis. Rex had no respect for traitors like Slick and was visibly unsettled with Slick's perspective that the clone troopers were slaves to their Jedi commanders. Despite Slick's claim that he had been striking a blow for all clones, Rex drew the conclusion that the sergeant's actions\u2014particularly putting his brothers' lives at risk by performing espionage for the Separatists\u2014evidenced that he did not love and care for them as he so believed.\n\nRex's commitment to the Republic remained undeterred during his later encounter with the clone deserter Cut Lawquane, who had left the Grand Army relatively early on in the war. After first meeting Lawquane, Rex displayed a lack of patience for those who would abandon their duty, and he made his contempt for the deserter known. Once he had assumed a more respectful attitude toward Lawquane, Rex maintained that his beliefs had not been programmed into him, as Lawquane suggested, and that they were undeniably his own. He believed that his military service made him part of the most pivotal moment in the Republic's history and that the Grand Army's failure to defeat the Confederacy would mean the insurrection of an inconceivable evil. Despite disagreeing with Lawquane's outlook and disapproval of the war, Rex came to respect Lawquane as possessing a different type of loyalty\u2014not to the Republic, but to his adopted family. Adding to his grudging but sincere regard for Lawquane was the deserter's brave effort to safeguard his family from invading droid commandos. When the time came to end his stay with Lawquane's family, Rex forwent his initial adamancy on turning in the fugitive Lawquane, opting not to report him as a deserter. He concluded that Lawquane was certainly not a coward and, before departing, politely refused his offer of a place at his farm.",

        "content": "# Rex - Development for the series[]\n\nAt first, the creators of The Clone Wars series planned to use Alpha, the Advanced Recon Commando featured throughout the Star Wars: Republic comic book series, as the television series' primary clone trooper character. Series Producer George Lucas objected to the selection of Alpha because his name would perpetuate too much of an alliteration between several main characters\u2014Anakin, Ahsoka, Artoo/R2-D2, and now \"Alpha\"\u2014hence, another clone trooper was created. Lucas provided the name \"Rex,\" securing the new character's role in Star Wars.\n\nRex's chin scar was based on the blemish that actor Harrison Ford\u2014who portrayed the smuggler Han Solo in the original trilogy of Star Wars films\u2014made famous in the Indiana Jones saga. Additionally, the Mandalorian Jaig eyes on Rex's armor helmet were derived from concept art for Boba Fett's helmet in the 1980 original trilogy film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, as later released in The Empire Strikes Back Sketchbook.\n\nDuring production on the episodes for the fourth season's \"Battle of Umbara\" story arc, the series' animation crew redesigned Rex's character model, incorporating the new Phase II clone trooper armor that had been gradually introduced for clone trooper characters since the advent of the fourth season. Director Dave Filoni developed the in-universe backstory for his unique \"hybrid\" armor\u2014Rex kept old parts from his Phase I suit and welded them with the new Phase II gear\u2014as another character trait for him, adding to his distinction and personality.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Leader from the front[]\n\nGruff, no-nonsense, and tough as carbonite nails, the elite Rex was an aggressive and battle-scarred veteran of the Clone Wars. Hardened by countless engagements with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Rex\u2014as he chose to be named\u2014retained a reputation as one of the best and toughest clone troopers in the galaxy, particularly due to his near-flawless military record. Freethinking, fearless, and resilient, he preferred to be more diplomatic than the headstrong Advanced Recon Commandos when it came to operating with his superiors, though he would not hesitate to give higher-ranking Jedi officers his blunt opinion. He regarded his assignments with the utmost priority, and true to his genetic engineering, he often put them before his own safety, recognizing the importance of doing his part to ensure an objective's completion. A cunning warrior who was versed in military strategy, Rex led from the front and, in some cases, would have fought ahead of his Jedi General, Anakin Skywalker. Far from being reckless, his courage and willingness to jump into the fray helped the Republic win numerous victories. His outspokenness and aggression notwithstanding, he held that it was a soldier's duty to follow orders, faithfully executing them even when he disagreed, with little concern for his own well-being. Although he was willing to lay down his life for victory if need be, he came to acknowledge that in some cases, soldiers had to make their own decisions.\n\nBrave and selfless, Rex was resolute in his dedication to his comrades. He recognized the need for galactic order and believed that the war was crucial to preserve the civilization that the Republic safeguarded. In spite of sometimes disagreeing with the management of the Republic's war effort by the Jedi High Council and the Galactic Senate, he remained committed in his service to the Republic. While on the war's front lines, he often became concerned for the safety of his Jedi officers, particularly for Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. As such, Rex was hesitant to follow orders that put the Jedi in danger, especially those that came from the Jedi themselves, and was willing to sacrifice his life for the Jedi. He came to regard his clone brethren as his home and family, and he never forgot the many brothers whom he had lost to the war. His first loss of a unit, Torrent Company, at the Battle of Teth hardened him even further, and that he survived the ordeal was visible in his character from then on. During that campaign, Rex did not waver in his commitment to the mission, in spite of the possibility that the battle could be his last. While leading a squad of rookie soldiers against a full Separatist detachment for control of Rishi Station, he disregarded the odds against him, focusing only on his objective to retake the Republic base.\n\nDespite witnessing enough of his comrades die to know that there was nothing glorious about war, Rex was unafraid to do his duty as a soldier of the Republic, even if it meant placing his own life and those of his troops in jeopardy. He made tough decisions calmly, would never back down from a fight, and was willing to fight to the last man if necessary; during the Second Battle of Geonosis, he even denounced a retreat as a cowardly tactic. Toughness aside, he viewed military service as an honor and greatly cared for the troops under his command, refusing to leave anyone behind if at all possible. He held the Separatist battle droids in contempt for all the damage that they had wrought on both him and his clone brethren, and cutting through droids on the battlefield frequently became an outlet for his rage and a way to avenge his fallen brothers. Despite his enmity with the Separatists, he assiduously lived by rules of engagement that transcended unwarranted behavior, regardless of provocation. After the loss of troopers Vere and Ince during a rescue mission, Rex pushed his anger to one side so that it would serve as fuel for the job at hand, intending to surrender to his feelings when in private. Sometimes, he even saw death as a method to assuage his belief that he had failed his men and to stop wondering how many more of them he would lose the next day. Yet he never gave up, watching over his troops throughout the pan-galactic conflict. Rex's care for his rookie 501st troopers on JanFathal was so substantial that he was surprised that his first instinct was not to look after Tano, whom he usually guided and mentored, but instead to take care of his men.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle for Ringo Vinda and the biochip conspiracy[]\n\nAt some point following Tano's departure from the Jedi Order, Rex went with Skywalker to Ringo Vinda to take its space station back from the Confederate forces under Admiral Trench. During the battle, Tup fired upon and killed Jedi General Tiplar. In the chaos, the 501st were forced to retreat. While Tup appeared to be unaware of his actions, he continued to display strange behavior and lash out violently towards Jedi. Both Jedi and clone leadership determined that Tup should be sent to Kamino for further evaluation. However, in the process, Tup was temporarily captured by Separatist forces on his departure from the station. Together Fives, Rex, and Anakin Skywalker retrieved a still-unconscious Tup before Trench's droids could abscond with him. Concerned for his friend's safety, Fives requested that he accompany the troubled clone to Kamino. Although Rex was required on the front lines, he allowed Fives to stay on Kamino, telling him to take care of Tup and himself.\n\nBy the time the 501st had returned to Coruscant, Fives had been named a fugitive, having been accused of attempting to assassinate the Chancellor. Through Kix, he gave Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex coordinates to rendezvous with Fives so that the three of them could speak privately.\n\nTo Fives' surprise, both Skywalker and Rex appeared at his requested meeting spot. Fearing that neither of his superiors would listen to his version of events, Fives requested that Skywalker and Rex go unarmed themselves and then trapped both in a ray shield. Agitated by his experience and prior drugging by conspiring Kaminoans, Fives struggled to explain his actions and his discoveries. Fives stated that artificially designed organic chips were planted into clones during the early stages of their development as sanctioned by the Chancellor and that, when activated, these chips compelled clones to strictly follow orders without question. When Skywalker too accused Fives of trying to assassinate the Chancellor, tension escalated.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Commander Fox and a squad of Coruscant guards arrived to arrest Fives, on direct orders from Palpatine. Desperate not to be captured, a terrified Fives reached for one of Rex's discarded blasters, prompting Fox to shoot him through the heart. Fives spent his final moments in the arms of Rex where he spoke his last words, reciting Tup's, having finally found peace. A distressed Rex then mourned over the body of his close friend. Though he was skeptical of Fives' warning, Rex felt he owed it to Fives to submit a grievance report on the chips. Even as he was recording it, Rex knew the report would be ignored. The report was classified and encrypted in the Republic archives.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Order 66[]\n\nOn the way back to Coruscant to deliver Maul into custody, Rex and Ahsoka met at the bridge of the Star Destroyer and watched as it entered hyperspace. Noticing she seemed thoughtful, Rex asked if something was on her mind. Ahsoka was distraught that while the Jedi were meant to be keepers of the peace, yet the war had turned them into soldiers, including her. Rex agreed\u2014but reminded her that without the war, the clones would not exist. Ahsoka replied that perhaps the war had brought some good, such as the friendship between them. Both of them then saluted each other. Right then, an officer called Rex away to listen to the latest briefing. Rex tried to make Tano join him, but she denied the offer.\n\nAt that moment, via hologram, Darth Sidious ordered all clone troopers to execute Order 66 and gave Rex special orders to execute Tano despite her no longer being a Jedi, which Rex agreed to do.Ahsoka came into the room then, feeling through the Force that something terrible had happened to Anakin. Rex, trembling, dropped his helmet, and to the Togruta's confusion, two other clones present aimed their blasters at her, prompting Rex to order them to stand down, stating that he'll execute her. However, at that moment he remembered what Fives had been trying to tell him about the inhibitor chips and he was briefly able fight his programming, and telling her to \"find him,\" but inevitably succumbed and shot at Ahsoka. Ahsoka defended herself against Rex and the other present clones before escaping. Rex ordered the clones to hunt down Ahsoka, the captive Maul, and any who opposed the clones. Ahsoka had a plan, however, and she eventually stunned Rex into unconsciousness with the help of some astromech droids\u2014one of which was Tano's astromech that had served alongside her on many occasions in the duration of the Clone Wars.\n\nAfter sneaking herself and Rex's unconscious body into the Venator's medical bay, Ahsoka engineered a defense against the closed bay door with the droids and located Rex's inhibitor chip in his brain using the Force. Ahsoka ordered the droids to surgically remove the chip while she prepared for the imminent door breach. When the clones finally breached through the door, Ahsoka was nearly overwhelmed by the blaster fire. However, Rex's operation completed just in time for him to regain his true consciousness and shoot down a few threatening clones. Rex apologized to Ahsoka for nearly killing her, and As Ahsoka asked him, how widespread the inhibitor chips were, Rex crushingly admitted they were in every single clone; thus, the entire Grand Army of the Republic had turned against the Jedi Knights. Rex and Ahsoka fought their way through the Star Destroyer, stunning the brainwashed clones along the way. Maul, on the other hand, advanced towards the ship's hyperdrive core, where he killed all the clones stationed inside. Using the Force to tear it apart, Maul destroyed the hyperdrive mid-jump and crippled the Star Destroyer beyond repair, killing many troopers sent to engage the renegade Sith Lord. The damage caused the Venator to lose lateral controls and to plummet towards the surface of a moon, being ensnared within the moon's gravitational pull and quickly descending while tearing apart.\n\nRex and Ahsoka made their way to the hangar bay controls and opened the main hangar doors, where they found they were awaited by a large force of clone troopers led by the ARC trooper Jesse. Ahsoka told Rex to not kill the clones, prompting him to reply that the clones wouldn't care and wouldn't hesitate to execute them. After a pause, Ahsoka removed Rex's helmet revealing that the clone has begun to cry, devastated with the current dilemma. Ahsoka comforted the clone, while revealing her plan, which as to try to bargain that since she was no longer a Jedi, Order 66 did not apply to her. This plan failed however, with Jesse announcing that Rex shall be demoted and then executed along with Tano, causing Rex to quip that he never much cared for being a commander. With the help of the astromech droids, they avoided the clones and made their way towards a Nu-class shuttle until Maul, escaping from the doomed ship, commandeered the shuttle and used it to escape the Destroyer. Meanwhile, Rex, piloting a Republic Y-wing bomber, which he took from the maintenance bay, exited the doomed Star Destroyer and saved Tano, who was plummeting towards the moon's surface.",

In the end, Cody's blaster is knocked out of his hand by Grievous, who subsequently kills Cody. Kenobi uses the fallen trooper's blaster to kill the General, though in the movie, Cody was nowhere near Grievous and Obi-Wan's battle, as he was leading the troops in the battle and Obi-Wan killed Grievous with his own blaster. Cody's appearance in the game is also used for all the other clone commanders that appear in the game. His minifigure in the game is a LEGO Star Corps Trooper.\n\nIn The Clone Wars first season episode \"The Hidden Enemy,\" Cody is mistakenly referred to as a captain by Kenobi, due to a script change in which Kenobi was originally talking to Captain Rex.\n\n",

On an ice planet, the two clone officers lead a patrol and encounter a squad of B1 and B2 battle droids along with an OG-9 spider droid and an All Terrain Armored Transport. Skidding across the ice, Cody drops a projectile, and Rex swings at the piece with his blaster. The projectile cuts through the droids and hits the AT-AT walker, collapsing it onto the spider droid and overturning a nearby NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer. With their enemies neutralized, the two clones build a Nu-class attack shuttle from the rubble. Rex and Cody then join Skywalker and Tano in raiding a Separatist Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship, where they rescue R2-D2 from Grievous, Ventress, and Count Dooku. As Rex and the others prepare to face off against the Separatists, Yoda and Kenobi arrive. Yoda uses the Force to collapse the floor beneath Dooku, Grievous, and Ventress, sending them into space, and also forms a CR90 corvette. Rex and his comrades uses the craft to escape from the Droid Control Ship shortly before it explodes. Following the victory, Rex and Cody accompany the Jedi to the \"Skywalker World\" theme park. Rex is also featured in the film's tie-in online game, in which he serves as one of the clone trooper enemies for the game's two playable Separatist characters, Dooku and Ventress.\n\nIn the \"Light Side\" campaign of The Yoda Chronicles game, Rex is one of the clone troopers who is made available as an in-game asset to defeat enemies. The only level in which he is offered is the final Coruscant level, in which the player, as Mace Windu, must open the Jedi Archives' Holocron Vault and defeat Grievous within. The player can purchase up to four copies of Rex at one of the level's build points; he is the most expensive clone trooper, with the cheaper ones being a standard trooper and a 501st trooper. However, using him is not required.",

        "content": "# Rex - Republic Heroes Nintendo DS edition[]\n\nThe Nintendo DS version of Republic Heroes presented accounts of events involving Rex that sharply diverged from the equivalents in several episodes of the television series' first season. In the game's interpretation of the mission to Skytop Station, General Grievous is absent, and the Republic squad is divided into two groups: Skywalker and Tano lead the first, while Rex and Denal comprise the second. The two units approach the station's reactor from different directions, and Skywalker eventually has the two clone troopers find a control panel to reactivate all systems in Sector AA-23.\n\nAfter destroying the station's reactor, Rex and Denal are ordered to rendezvous with the Jedi at the hangar so that they can escape aboard the Twilight. However, the destruction of the reactor triggers a fail-safe lockdown that seals the hangar's doors. R2-D2 discovers that there are two terminals controlling the lockdown, both of which need to be deactivated to open the hangar doors. Arriving in the hangar bay, Rex and Denal defeat a number of battle droids there and prepare the Twilight for takeoff. Tano and R2-D2 join them, and the astromech droid deactivates the first terminal. Skywalker disables the second terminal on the station's outer hull, thus shutting down the lockdown. As several IG-86 sentinel droids pin down Rex, Tano, and Denal inside the Twilight, Skywalker defeats them and opens the hangar doors before escaping the station with the group. This portrayal of events opposes the version featured in the episode \"Duel of the Droids,\" in which the mission was first depicted.\n\nRex is also featured in a different mission that conflicts with the episode \"Lair of Grievous.\" He and two other clone troopers assist Jedi Master Kit Fisto in infiltrating General Grievous's castle on the third moon of Vassek, while in the episode, it is Jedi Knight Nahdar Vebb; Clone Commander Fil; and other clone troopers who accompany Fisto. Leaving the two clone troopers outside, Rex and Fisto navigate through the lair's mazes and fight numerous B1 and B2 battle droids, eventually confronting Grievous himself. After a brief duel with Fisto, Grievous retreats further into the castle, and Rex tells his soldiers outside to contact the Republic fleet at the planet Bestine and ask for reinforcements\u2014an action that Fil does during the episode. However, the troopers fail to complete their orders, as a Vulture droid decimates their Nu-class attack shuttle, their only means of contacting Bestine. Rex and Fisto continue their pursuit of Grievous but are forced to split up. The Jedi Master eventually faces Grievous for a second time before retreating aboard his Delta-7B starfighter.\n\nRex later participates in a mission to the space station Juma 9, which is a strategic Confederate outpost instead of a Republic mining facility like in the other editions of Republic Heroes. Using Separatist clearance codes that were previously stolen from Grievous's lair on the Vassek moon, Rex and another trooper accompany Luminara Unduli and Plo Koon to infiltrate the station. While Unduli and Koon set off to capture the station's bridge, Rex and his comrade prepare to breach the station's hull if needed. The droid forces eventually trap the two Jedi Masters between two force fields, and Rex is called in to assist them. He and the trooper move through the station and rescue the two Jedi. After doing so, Koon orders Rex and the other trooper to secure the nearby vicinity while the Jedi Masters seize Juma 9's bridge. Besides the Juma 9 mission, Rex is involved in a bonus level in which he races through a battle zone to a checkpoint on Christophsis. Because of these storylines' explicit contradictions of the original events in the television series, this article assumes that the Nintendo DS missions are non-canonical.\n\n",

Despite their rescuing Master Koth, Grievous escaped to the surface of Saleucami. Rex went with General Kenobi and Cody to track him down.\n\nRex and several of his troopers investigated the remains of Grievous's landing ship. Rex took Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix through the wetlands to find Grievous. However, Rex was shot by a commando droid sniper. He survived, but needed a bacta patch and to be left behind at a farm to recover. He discovered that the owner of the farm was a clone deserter named Cut Lawquane. At first, Rex was disgusted by Lawquane's lack of commitment to the Republic. Despite this, Rex accepted his children's invitation to dinner. Rex talked about how he would stay in the army, no matter what happened. Cut told Rex why he left the army, as his squad had been ambushed and killed off shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis; as the only survivor, he fled. During the night, Cut's children accidentally reactivated a pod of disabled commando droids, so he and Cut defended the house from them; Cut saved him from one of them. The next morning, Rex prepared to leave, stating that he did not see Cut as a coward anymore and would not report him to the Republic. While Lawquane offered Rex a chance to stay with his family, Rex declined, saying that his family was elsewhere. With this, he left to rejoin Kenobi and his other clone brothers.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Transition to Phase II[]\n\nWhen the Republic began to have its clone soldiers transition to the Phase II set of clone trooper armor, Rex did not particularly care for the new equipment, as he believed that it was prefabricated and too disposable. He did not immediately switch over to Phase II, but when he did, he developed his own unique version of Phase II armor, combining elements of his old Phase I suit and the latest Phase II technology into a hybrid of both armor sets. Salvaging the middle portion of his old Phase I helmet, including his rangefinder scope and original T-visor, he welded them together with the new Phase II helmet's upgraded breath filters and voice output annunciator. He did the same for portions of his chest plates, and the resulting weld marks became another of his armor suit's distinctions.\n\nAlthough Rex modified his helmet, he retained his Jaig eyes from his Phase I suit. Aside from a redesigned pauldron with an ammunition pack and an updated wrist comlink that he transferred to his right arm, he continued to use the rest of his Phase I equipment, including his kama, utility belt, removable spot lamps, and quick-draw blaster holsters. Though he still carried electrobinoculars, he began to use a polarized macrobinoculars attachment with his helmet. He even began to engrave tally marks into his helmet, gauntlet, and forearm and leg plates. In addition, he started carrying an Imagecaster holoprojector. He used a JT-12 jetpack with his Phase II armor as required, as well as a SCUBA trooper mask, decorated with his Jaig eyes and blue 501st markings, for underwater combat. For space-walking, he used breathmask survival gear, which consisted of a back-mounted pack with breathing tubes that connected to both of his helmet's breath filters.\n\nFor the assignment of helping the Jedi train the Onderon rebels, Rex adopted a new suit of armor to avoid using his usual, distinguishable set of 501st white and blue. The result was a set of black fatigues with a limited amount of equipment, including a jetpack for the deployment into the Onderonian jungle. Although he chose a different helmet with a visor and goggles, he made sure to have a rangefinder for his helmet and also sported his Jaig eyes on his chest plate.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Mentor to Ahsoka Tano[]\n\nAfter meeting Ahsoka Tano on Christophsis, Rex admired her spirit, though he was concerned with her initial naivety and arrogance toward her commanders, particularly Skywalker. Once the captain and Padawan reached an understanding of each other, they began to form a strong bond and supported each other as the galaxy-shaking war progressed. Rex often addressed Tano as \"kid\" in lieu of a more formal title. As Tano's teacher in military matters when Skywalker was absent, Rex preferred to train by example, and it was in that manner that he often instructed Tano. Among his lessons for her was that smart remarks were unhelpful and disruptive in times of protocol, especially when they were directed at her Master. They came to respect each other, and he earned her trust with her life. He defended her proficiency from others who expressed hesitancy with her competence, including fellow officers like Gilad Pellaeon and Wilhuff Tarkin. In addition, Rex encouraged Skywalker himself to maintain his faith in his Padawan during a confrontation with Asajj Ventress on Taronda. Rex's attitude toward Tano was such that Skywalker came to trust him with her, and Skywalker additionally recognized that some of the Padawan's lessons were better learned from the captain instead of himself.\n\nRex helped Tano through several tough situations, including on Maridun, where their team was forced to find medical attention for a grievously wounded Skywalker, and at JanFathal, when their encounter with the Altisian Jedi challenged her beliefs in the Jedi Code. Rex also guided Tano in her first command position at Ryloth, even though she expressed insecurity with the role. Although he was skilled in strategy and carefully identified the obstacles that hindered Tano's plan to break the Separatist blockade of Ryloth, he remained respectful toward her and did not outright criticize her proposed tactic. He mentored her in leadership as time went on, instilling in her the importance of inspiring one's troops and leading by example on the battlefield, no matter the situation. On occasions when Tano was unable to voice her full concerns to him because of security or protocol surrounding certain assignments, Rex fully understood the reasons behind her withholding of confidential information, and he did not take it personally. Although in some cases he knew when she was concealing her fears from him, including those about her Master's life, he did not criticize her for being afraid; instead, he supported her in what ways he could.\n\nDuring the search for the fugitive Tano at the Republic military base, Rex refused to believe that she had slaughtered three clone troopers while escaping, even though the lightsaber cuts on the corpses indicated that she was responsible. Nevertheless, he was forced to set aside his personal beliefs in favor of the evidence at hand, stating in a following all-points bulletin that Tano had killed the three soldiers. Rex's instincts were later upheld when it was revealed that Barriss Offee had committed all the crimes for which Tano had been accused.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - War of loyalties[]\n\nAs the Clone Wars continued, Rex feared that the Republic was beginning to view the clone troopers as a deindividualized, disposable army. He nevertheless upheld the mindset that the clone troopers' responsibility was to carry out and die for their missions when necessary. As he argued with Fives during the Battle of Umbara, that belief stemmed from his own code, not from the Kaminoans engineering him to think as such. In spite of his doubts about the clones' place in the Republic, he preserved his belief in the system for which he and his men were fighting. He held that the clone troopers were not independent of one another, that they were part of something larger than themselves, and it was thus not up to them to disobey orders in favor of strategies that they deemed more effective. Yet he was forced to draw the line when his loyalty to orders required that he see out General Pong Krell's decree to execute troopers Fives and Jesse for insubordination. Rex consequently realized that in some cases, it was necessary to make one's own decisions instead of blindly following orders like battle droids. Although he retained his loyalty to the Republic despite the incident with Krell, the Battle of Umbara left a lasting impression on his outlook as a clone trooper. In the face of so many casualties, he questioned the point of the war and wondered what would happen to the clones when the conflict ended, when they would no longer be needed as soldiers to fight the Clone Wars.",

Unbeknownst to Rex and his comrades, the truth was just as Fives had said: Palpatine's explanation was a cover-up on the part of his alter ego, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, to mask an anti-Jedi directive that he and Count Dooku intended to execute via the clone troopers.",

        "content": "# Rex - Deleted scenes and cut storylines[]\n\nSeveral brief scenes featuring Rex in two first season episodes\u2014\"Rising Malevolence\" and \"Storm Over Ryloth\"\u2014were cut from the final versions that were broadcast on Cartoon Network, but they were included in their Director's Cut editions in The Complete Season One DVD collection, released in 2009, which integrated them into Star Wars canon.\n\nRex appears in one of several deleted scenes from the second season episode \"Duchess of Mandalore.\" In the scene, following the Galactic Senate's decision to abstain from occupying Mandalore, Rex seeks out Anakin Skywalker, who has been overseeing preparations for the Mandalore-bound fleet at a Coruscant staging area. After Rex informs him of the Senate vote, Skywalker is pleased to hear the news and has Rex relay the orders to stand down to the rest of the fleet. Although the scene was fully animated, it was cut from the final version of the episode as part of an abandoned story thread featuring Skywalker's military preparations for the Republic occupation of Mandalore.\n\nA deleted scene from the third season episode \"ARC Troopers\" has Rex lecturing troopers Echo and Fives in the Resolute's hangar bay about their expectations to have already been promoted to Advanced Recon Commandos. While cut from the final version of the episode, it was included in the young-readers book Defenders of the Republic's adaptation of the episode, thus canonizing the scene.\n\nIn Series Writer Matt Michnovetz's original script for the fourth season episode \"Carnage of Krell,\" Rex was to execute General Pong Krell for his crimes against the Republic, but Filoni decided that such a move would not be appropriate for his character. As a result, the role of Krell's executioner was given to rookie trooper Dogma. A cut storyline from the fourth season episode \"The Box,\" scripted by Brent Friedman, involved Skywalker searching for the bounty hunter Rako Hardeen, whom Obi-Wan Kenobi is posing as for an undercover operation. The Jedi High Council attempts to prevent Skywalker from discovering the real Hardeen, who is in their custody, but when Skywalker finds Rex transporting Hardeen off-world, the Council is forced to reveal the truth. The storyline was abandoned for time and clarity, as well as the unlikelihood of Rex keeping information of that measure of importance from his Jedi General.\n\nIn a deleted scene from the fifth season episode \"A War on Two Fronts,\" Rex shows the Onderon rebels how to construct homemade EMP grenades by coiling a wire around a magnet, then adding a remote detonator. He demonstrates the device on a pair of captured B1 battle droids, with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano further explaining the advantages of such weaponry to the rebels. Another short deleted scene from a fifth season episode, \"To Catch a Jedi,\" has Rex accompanying Skywalker, Plo Koon, and a Coruscant Guard detail to Coruscant's Level 1313, where Clone Commander Wolffe and his troopers are recovering from a failed attempt to capture a fugitive Tano and Asajj Ventress.\n\nIn March 2013, following the fifth season's finale, Lucasfilm announced that the television series would be ending. Since then, Friedman has indicated that there were more plans for Rex in future seasons. In a November 2013 interview with the Rebels Report podcast, Friedman described a story arc that he had scripted featuring Rex and R2-D2 on a major adventure that would have been fun, as well as \"dark in its own way.\" The majority of the story was set on one of the moons of Ryloth. Friedman related the \"personal hook\" of the arc to the film Terminator 2, since Rex and R2-D2 would have hijacked a super battle droid and would have become attached to it over time. The story arc, comprising four episodes, would have been released as part of an eighth season, though production for those episodes was never completed. Friedman stated that writing those episodes increased his appreciation for Rex as a character.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Slaves of the Republic[]\n\nThe television series' fourth season adapted the 2008 Slaves of the Republic comic book story arc into a three-episode arc: \"Kidnapped,\" \"Slaves of the Republic,\" and \"Escape from Kadavo,\" with Henry Gilroy\u2014previous Head Writer and the author of the original comics\u2014scripting the episodes alongside Steven Melching. Aside from the visual difference of incorporating the new character models for Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and Obi-Wan Kenobi from the third season and Rex's Phase II model from previous fourth season episodes, the trio of episodes transcribed plot elements from the six-part comic story. They are thus treated as the same story, with precedence being given to the television series in cases of inconsistencies.\n\nIn Slaves of the Republic - Chapter 1: The Mystery of Kiros, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi respond to the Confederate invasion of Kiros by launching a counterattack against the droid forces on the planet. The Separatist commander is Xerius Ugg, who was replaced with the Zygerrian Darts D'Nar in \"Kidnapped.\" In the comic, when Skywalker and Tano go to defuse the thermal bombs throughout the capital city, Rex assists them once they come under fire from a sniper droideka at one of the bomb sites, using a sniper rifle to eliminate the droid. That scene is absent from \"Kidnapped,\" in which Skywalker and Tano face off against two sniper droidekas on their own. Furthermore, D'Nar reveals the reason for the disappearance of the Togruta colonists, a role that the Zygerrian Captain Onyx fills in Chapter 2: Slave Traders of Zygerria.\n\nChapter 2: Slave Traders of Zygerria begins with Rex accompanying Skywalker, Tano, Kenobi, and a squad of troopers aboard the Twilight to the black market haven known as the Shi'kar Straits. Amidst the asteroids of the Shi'kar Straits, Rex and the others encounter the Zygerrian slaver vessel Fate's Hand, captained by Onyx. Posing as slavers, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi board the Fate's Hand to acquire what information they can, while Rex and his troops hide behind several crates as backup. When the Jedi give up the ruse, Rex and the clone troopers forsake their cover and initiate a firefight with the Zygerrians. As Skywalker leads Rex, Tano, and some of their men to commandeer the Fate's Hand, more Zygerrians catch them in a crossfire. When a Zygerrian fires a rocket that damages the seal between the two vessels, Tano intentionally seals herself aboard the Fate's Hand, while Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi are stuck on the Twilight with several trapped Zygerrians, who surrender. A dismayed Rex reports Tano's actions to Skywalker and Kenobi, who deduce that she intends to infiltrate the Fate's Hand by acting as a hostage.\n\nRex secures the docking clamps of the Twilight to ensure that they will not be separated from the Fate's Hand. Attempting to break free of the Twilight, Onyx pilots his ship through the asteroid belt, and the Twilight's bottom stabilizer is compromised from a collision with an asteroid. After Skywalker fires at and disables the engines of the Fate's Hand, Tano contacts the Twilight. At Kenobi's direction, she is able to unlock the Zygerrian ship's rear airlock, but Onyx discovers her exploit. Rex and another trooper follow Skywalker and Kenobi on a space-walk to board the Fate's Hand and rescue Tano, but a blixus creature that Onyx has released intercepts them. The blaster-impervious creature kills the other clone trooper and captures the two Jedi in its tentacles before Skywalker in turn kills the beast, halting its rampage. Boarding the Fate's Hand, Rex and the Jedi confront Onyx, who is forced to convey his intelligence regarding the missing Togruta. Onyx reveals what Darts D'Nar does in \"Kidnapped\"\u2014that the Royal Slave Auction is being revived on Zygerria, and the people of Kiros are to be sold into slavery. At Kenobi's behest, Rex takes Onyx to imprison him on the Twilight with the rest of his crew. As a whole, the storyline of Slave Traders of Zygerria underwent substantial revision before being included in \"Kidnapped.\"\n\nThe next episode, \"Slaves of the Republic,\" adapts plot elements from the comic's third and fourth issues, The Depths of Zygerria and Auction of a Million Souls. In the episode, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi take a Zygerrian vessel to Zygerria to investigate the Royal Slave Auction, though it is D'Nar's Tecora instead of Onyx's Fate's Hand. Although The Depths of Zygerria depicts Skywalker initially considering having Rex masquerade as the undercover team's slave for sale, only for Tano to convince him otherwise, that detail is not present in \"Slaves of the Republic,\" in which Tano is disguised as the group's slave from the beginning, while Rex has the alternate task of helping Kenobi find the missing Togruta.\n\nIn The Depths of Zygerria, after Skywalker sends her back to the ship, Tano joins Rex and Kenobi in trailing Skywalker and his Zygerrian guard escorts to the Zygerrian Royal Palace. She is thus present when Rex and Kenobi find Governor Roshti in the palace's catacomb cells. After liberating Roshti, Rex and his comrades escape from Zygerrian guards aboard a pair of reptile-like creatures. Skywalker contacts Tano and orders her to come to the palace, as he requires slave merchandise to prove to Queen Miraj Scintel his cover story as a slave hunter. While the Zygerrians capture Kenobi and Roshti, Rex and Tano proceed to the palace as slave handler and slave, respectively, helping Skywalker win both Scintel's trust and a seat at the Royal Slave Auction.\n\nThe events of the episode proceed differently: Tano remains with Skywalker from the beginning of the mission to distract Scintel, allowing Rex and Kenobi to scour the palace area for the Togruta colonists. Rex and Kenobi discover Roshti in the Royal Palace's outdoor slave cells instead of in the catacomb cells, and all three of them attempt to escape on a brezak mount, with only Rex succeeding in reaching safety. He does not return to the Royal Palace to pose as Tano's handler as he does in the comic; the episode instead moves forward and depicts the Royal Slave Auction. In the comic, when Skywalker launches their attack on the Zygerrians at the auction house, Rex ambushes the royal guards by swinging from a cable, only to be knocked unconscious by a rocket from one of the guards. In the episode, he fights alongside the Jedi in a similar fashion, though he is instead felled by a Zygerrian guard's shock whip. For the entirety of the episode, Rex wears a Zygerrian slave trader suit, whereas in the comics he disguises himself as a member of Skywalker's security detail and, later, as a Zygerrian guard with bulky armor for the Royal Slave Auction. He consequently retains his slave trader uniform when he arrives on Kadavo in the episode, instead of the plain robe that he dons in Auction of a Million Souls.\n\nWhereas the keeper of the Kadavo facility went unnamed in the comics, material for the television series' adaptation identified the character as Agruss. In Chapter 5: A Slave now, a Slave forever, the Togruta are punished for Kenobi's defiance as they are in \"Escape from Kadavo.\" Absent from the episode but present in Chapter 6: Escape from Kadavo is the Togrutas' belief that the Confederacy has obliterated their homeworld, which intensifies their despair. While working at an atmosphere-filtration turbine station alongside the Togruta, Rex and Kenobi rally the colonists with the news that Kiros has been liberated, giving them a reason to endure and survive the ordeal. The Togrutas' response to that news, perceived as hope, is what leads the keeper to call Rex and Kenobi to the command center for execution, instead of Count Dooku ordering him to do so, as is the case in the episode.\n\nThe manner in which Skywalker and Tano rescue Rex, Kenobi, and the Togruta slaves on Kadavo differs greatly between the comic and the episode. In the comic, Skywalker and Tano arrive on Kadavo with a Republic strike force led by Commander Cody. The Separatists respond by deploying a fleet under the joint command of General Grievous and Asajj Ventress, the latter of whom leads a Vulture droid assault on the facility, as Dooku aims to hide his involvement in the slavery affair by eliminating the Togruta. Rex and Kenobi take advantage of the distracted Zygerrians by attacking them and joining Skywalker and Tano in rescuing the Togruta from falling into the lava pit below the compound. While Grievous recalls his assault fleet, the Jedi use the Force to pull the Togruta onto a freighter. When Ventress assaults the Jedi's freighter with her personal starship, the Trident, Rex fires a rocket at the craft, and the arrival of Plo Koon and a squadron of V-19 Torrent starfighters forces Ventress to retreat. Also, the keeper is not killed, simply taken into Republic custody. In the episode, no enemy forces save for the Zygerrians defend the facility against the Republic's rescue attempt. In place of Cody, Commander Wolffe and Admiral Coburn help Koon coordinate the rescue effort. Furthermore, instead of being involved with the rescue of the Togruta, Rex and Kenobi kill Keeper Agruss and defeat his guards before departing from the compound, while Tano, Wolffe, and Coburn save the colonists.\n\nThe aftermath of the rescue on Kadavo was also modified from the comic's version for the episode. In the comic, Rex and the others spend four more rotations evacuating the Togruta, after which they prepare to destroy the processing hub. As Rex is about to detonate charges placed in the facility, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine contacts them and orders that the facility be preserved for future Republic use. The Jedi disagree with the order, and Rex proceeds with eradicating the complex. Upon being returned to Kiros, the Togruta forsake their pacifistic ways to learn how to defend themselves, and Rex is among the clone troopers who educate them in blaster combat. In the episode's portrayal of the events, Koon's aerial forces demolish the Kadavo complex during the battle. Rex and the others debrief aboard Koon's Star Destroyer, but the episode does not include the Togrutas' return to Kiros.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Phase I armor and weaponry[]\n\nDuring the first months of the war, Rex used a suit of plastoid Phase I clone trooper armor that was customized with the white and blue of the 501st Legion. His polarized T-visor helmet sported Mandalorian Jaig eyes as battle honors and was equipped with a fold-down rangefinder scope that included a night vision filter. For supplemental head gear, he used a visor with an inbuilt telemetry system and a pair of removable spot lamps that boasted a viewing range of forty feet. His helmet systems included infrared vision; an array of sensors; an internal comlink; visual and auditory buffers; and a heads-up display with thermal imaging and biosign indicators.\n\nTo complement his body armor, Rex sported a traditional kama half kilt, constructed out of leather and thick anti-blast armor, to repel low-flying shrapnel and debris. He also wore over his left shoulder a semi-blue pauldron armor plate, which was reserved for clone officers. It was punctured through the chest plate by an enemy droid sniper during the Battle of Saleucami. Besides boots with magnetic gripsoles, Rex used a variety of other tools: a vibroblade in one of his gauntlets; a wrist comlink for his left gauntlet; a medpac and high-calorie dry rations in his utility belt; and a rappel line with a winch control motor for climbing during combat. His armor suit had an airtight seal and a limited oxygen supply, which allowed him to survive in the vacuum of space for brief intervals, such as during the Battle of Devaron. For some operations, he wore standard-issue white clone trooper armor. While on Orto Plutonia, he donned cold-weather armor\u2014including a thermal suit and rebreather hood, the latter of which was decorated with his Jaig eyes\u2014for protection from the cold. Although necessary for surviving Orto Plutonia's hazardous conditions, the extra gear dangerously limited his movements in battle.\n\nBeing skilled in marksmanship, Rex never underestimated the capabilities of a good old-fashioned blaster and used a variety of weapons in combat. He preferred to wield a pair of DC-17 hand blasters for their speed, a trait that he shared with the dual pistol\u2013using Jango Fett, the bounty hunter from whom he was cloned. Rex cut his blasters' holsters at his waist to be able to draw them more quickly. Although his two DC-17s were his signature choice of weaponry, he sometimes used a DC-15S or a DC-15A blaster rifle. On JanFathal, he used a DC-15 with a customized detonite grenade launcher attachment. He also used a grappling hook extension as required. As thanks for helping to contain the Blue Shadow Virus on Naboo, Rex received a set of modified DC-17s from Theed Arms. The pistols, dubbed the \"Vigilance\" and \"Negotiator,\" were specially plated with metallic chromium, a prerogative of the Naboo royalty. When it came to heavy weaponry, Rex was capable with using missile launchers like the RPS-6 rocket launcher, which he employed against enemy ground vehicles.\n\nRex carried a set of electrobinoculars for expanding his viewing range on the battlefield. When the situation called for it, he used a JT-12 jetpack and accompanying flight equipment, as he possessed expertise with the gear. He used a space combat propulsion pack to boost his jetpack's range for high elevations, for as far reaches as realspace. While away from the front lines, Rex made himself comfortable with black fatigues instead of his usual hefty armor.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Umbara[]\n\nRex, along with Skywalker, Fives, and the rest of the 501st were sent to Umbara to help Masters Tiin, Krell, and Kenobi take its capital, while Tano and Offee fought the space battle. After the initial landing and fighting with the Umbaran militia, Rex and the 501st were placed under the command of Krell when the Chancellor requested Skywalker return to Coruscant. As the troops were pushed hard on a long march, Krell denied them rest despite Rex's protests. When Krell ordered a full-frontal assaults on the capital, he denied Rex's request to carry out Skywalker's plan. During the first attack on the road to the capital, the clones were surrounded, and without cover, suffered heavy losses. As Rex was forced to order a retreat, Krell disdainfully ordered reinforcements and angrily confronted Rex for disobeying him. When Krell roared at Rex, Rex retorted by reminding him that he had a duty to protect the men under his command.\n\nRex, Krell, and the 501st were sent to capture an airbase that was resupplying the capital. Rex was ordered to go through a gorge that would leave them exposed. Rex tried to reason with Krell to no avail. Despite the objections of Fives, Jesse, and the rest of the 501st, Rex convinced his men to carry out Krell's orders. As they made their way through the gorge, they were attacked by the Umbarans' crawler tanks, which they destroyed. They were then confronted by the Umbarans' MHCs, which had heavy armor impervious to their rocket launchers. To combat them, Rex sent Fives and Hardcase to infiltrate their base and use their own Zenuas 33 Umbaran starfighters on the MHCs. Despite Krell's orders to push the attack, Rex and his men held them off until Fives and Hardcase destroyed the MHCs. The base was taken and secured despite the heavy losses.\n\nWhen Kenobi contacted them about the capital's long-range missiles being supplied by a Dual Hemisphere-Omni Support Vessel, Rex proposed that they attack the ship to cut off the supplies. However, Krell proposed attacking the capital despite the missiles, much to Rex's and Kenobi's surprise. Rex was ordered to prepare the men for the attack, despite the heavy casualties. Rex at first complied but was then told of an idea by Fives to use the starfighter codes to infiltrate and destroy the supply ship. However, Krell objected to it. Following a mishap in a hangar, Rex gave Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase permission to carry out the mission. However, he told them that if they were caught, he would not be able to protect them. Rex watched as they took off on their mission and stopped Dogma and Tup from informing Krell. Krell later confronted Rex, who told him that he authorized a reconnaissance mission to make his strategy more efficient. Rex then saw the supply ship's explosion. Rex, Fives, and Jesse were brought before Krell, where he reprimanded them. Despite Rex's objections, Krell had Fives and Jesse taken to the brig for insubordination.\n\nRex spoke with Krell to convince him to spare Fives and Jesse, telling him that the men were with him despite his reckless tactics. Despite this, Krell ordered Rex and his men to execute them, but they refused to do so. Rex and Krell were then contacted by a trooper who informed them that they were ambushed by the Umbarans disguised as clones. Rex was sent to attack the Umbarans. Rex and his men, armed with mortars, went into the jungle, where they were attacked by the troopers. However, Rex examined one of the troopers and discovered they were clones. Rex ran in front of both his men and the troopers, revealing the deception. Rex then spoke with the 212th Attack Battalion platoon leader, Waxer, who revealed that it was Krell who ordered the attack before dying of his wounds.",

        "content": "# Rex - Effective commander[]\n\nAs the dissenting trio's commanding officer, Rex displayed a measure of responsibility for his subordinates' exploits, even though the decision to disobey orders had been theirs and not his. When Fives and Jesse returned, Rex tried to take the full blame and punishment for their actions, claiming that he had ordered them to disregard Krell's decree, though Fives returned the gesture by honorably reporting the truth of their disobedience to Krell. In the end, Rex's concern for his troops' welfare outshone his adherence to Krell's authority: He openly disobeyed Krell's subsequent orders to execute Fives and Jesse. He knew that if such punishment was rendered even once, then all of the 501st Legion could eventually face a similar demise, and he refused to let his men be subjected to fear of execution. He was horrified when Krell manipulated the 501st into attacking fellow clone troopers from the 212th Attack Battalion; the incident instilled in him the need for justice to prevent a recurrence of such an atrocity. He thus resolved to lead his men into the \"uncharted territory\" of arresting Krell for treason against the Republic. Given the mutinous nature of his proposal, Rex knew that he could not force his men into participating and gave them the option to opt out, though all of them except for Dogma supported his decision. For the entirety of the episode, Rex persevered in his commitment to his men, for whose safety he sought to detain Krell.",

        "content": "# Rex - Individualism and beliefs[]\n\nRex learned what he could from the Republic's HoloNet News information bulletins, being used to absorbing information in that manner from his early Kaminoan flash training. He sometimes made judgments based on the contents of his training; for example, he respected diplomacy as a kind of fighting for which he lacked training. On the other hand, he saw fighting simply as a skill in which he was versed, not claiming to absolutely like it. Unlike some other officers in the Grand Army, he respected malformed clones like 99, whose strong spirit earned his admiration, and was greatly saddened when 99 died during the Battle of Kamino. Some of Rex's views were less open-minded, particularly as he encountered different cultures on his tour of duty. At times he did not pay much attention to history or culture; he initially could not understand the Lurmen of Maridun and their pacifistic choice to avoid fighting, attributing such behavior to a lack of pride. He also looked down on the Lorrdian militiamen during the battle for Ereesus, though he learned to trust and respect their aptitude for kinetic communication. When it was too late for the Lorrdians to return to their own base, he welcomed them to bunk with his own men. The experience additionally led him to form a close working relationship with one of the Lorrdian officers, Sollaw ap-Orwien. On Onderon, Rex embraced his leadership role in training the local rebels, treating them as he would the troops under his command. He did not hesitate to push them, impelling them to perform maneuvers like the soldiers they strove to become. When the time came to leave Onderon, Rex was impressed with the rebels' efforts.\n\nRex was tan-skinned and stood 1.83 meters tall, weighing eighty kilograms. He was versed in Galactic Basic Standard, the primary language of the Republic. Due to his naturally accelerated age, he was ten years old by the time of the Battle of Christophsis in 22 BBY, though his physical development was that of an older Human man. He paid considerable attention to his hairstyle, as he found hair under a helmet to be bothersome and annoying. As such, he regularly kept his naturally black hair shaved to a fine polish to prevent it from interfering with his concentration on the battlefield. Even so, he dyed his hair a light blond, his most obvious unique trait, and let it grow out to a certain extent on various occasions. He experimented with other hairstyles as well, briefly dying his hair blue after choosing to support the Bylluran Athletic bolo-ball team when it reached the finals. However, he eventually deemed his new hairstyle undignified and inappropriate for a commanding officer, and he shaved it off to better fit in with his black-haired troops. Rex had a small scar beneath his lower lip. He sometimes bared his allegedly perfect teeth in a feral smile when adrenalized for a coming engagement with the Separatists.",

        "content": "# Rex - Mission to Geonosis[]\n\nRex accompanied the crew of the Ghost to investigate an Imperial construction module above the planet Geonosis. As a veteran of the Clone Wars and a participant of the second battle that took place on the planet, Rex was aware that Geonosis was home to billions of Geonosians. Thus, he was surprised when Chopper picked up no sign of life on the planet. Ezra then sensed through the Force that all life on Geonosis had been extinguished. Upon landing in the seemingly abandoned module, Rex stayed aboard the ship with Hera and Chopper while the other rebels went to explore the station. Shortly, they discovered that they had stumbled into a trap set by the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus.\n\nWhile Rex helped Hera to man the Ghost's defenses against Imperial All Terrain Defense Pod walkers, Chopper freed the other rebels by unlocking the blast doors from the control console. Rex and the other rebels escaped the Imperial module aboard the Ghost. However, Zeb was separated and escaped in an escape pod with Kallus. After escaping Imperial TIE fighters, Rex and his fellow rebels began looking for Zeb. Despite sweeping through the system, they were unable to find Zeb, which led Rex to remark that the Lasat had a slim chance of survival.\n\nMeanwhile, Zeb and Kallus landed on Bahryn, one of Geonosis's moons. After working together to fight off Bonzami predators, the two struck an unlikely friendship. Zeb activated his transponder, and the crew of the Ghost rescued him. Rex and the other rebels except Chopper greeted Zeb at the ship's gangplank after landing on Bahryn.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Slaves of the Republic[]\n\nThe next episode, \"Slaves of the Republic,\" adapts plot elements from the comic's third and fourth issues, The Depths of Zygerria and Auction of a Million Souls. In the episode, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi take a Zygerrian vessel to Zygerria to investigate the Royal Slave Auction, though it is D'Nar's Tecora instead of Onyx's Fate's Hand. Although The Depths of Zygerria depicts Skywalker initially considering having Rex masquerade as the undercover team's slave for sale, only for Tano to convince him otherwise, that detail is not present in \"Slaves of the Republic,\" in which Tano is disguised as the group's slave from the beginning, while Rex has the alternate task of helping Kenobi find the missing Togruta.\n\nIn The Depths of Zygerria, after Skywalker sends her back to the ship, Tano joins Rex and Kenobi in trailing Skywalker and his Zygerrian guard escorts to the Zygerrian Royal Palace. She is thus present when Rex and Kenobi find Governor Roshti in the palace's catacomb cells. After liberating Roshti, Rex and his comrades escape from Zygerrian guards aboard a pair of reptile-like creatures. Skywalker contacts Tano and orders her to come to the palace, as he requires slave merchandise to prove to Queen Miraj Scintel his cover story as a slave hunter. While the Zygerrians capture Kenobi and Roshti, Rex and Tano proceed to the palace as slave handler and slave, respectively, helping Skywalker win both Scintel's trust and a seat at the Royal Slave Auction.\n\nThe events of the episode proceed differently: Tano remains with Skywalker from the beginning of the mission to distract Scintel, allowing Rex and Kenobi to scour the palace area for the Togruta colonists. Rex and Kenobi discover Roshti in the Royal Palace's outdoor slave cells instead of in the catacomb cells, and all three of them attempt to escape on a brezak mount, with only Rex succeeding in reaching safety. He does not return to the Royal Palace to pose as Tano's handler as he does in the comic; the episode instead moves forward and depicts the Royal Slave Auction. In the comic, when Skywalker launches their attack on the Zygerrians at the auction house, Rex ambushes the royal guards by swinging from a cable, only to be knocked unconscious by a rocket from one of the guards. In the episode, he fights alongside the Jedi in a similar fashion, though he is instead felled by a Zygerrian guard's shock whip. For the entirety of the episode, Rex wears a Zygerrian slave trader suit, whereas in the comics he disguises himself as a member of Skywalker's security detail and, later, as a Zygerrian guard with bulky armor for the Royal Slave Auction. He consequently retains his slave trader uniform when he arrives on Kadavo in the episode, instead of the plain robe that he dons in Auction of a Million Souls.\n\nWhereas the keeper of the Kadavo facility went unnamed in the comics, material for the television series' adaptation identified the character as Agruss. In Chapter 5: A Slave now, a Slave forever, the Togruta are punished for Kenobi's defiance as they are in \"Escape from Kadavo.\" Absent from the episode but present in Chapter 6: Escape from Kadavo is the Togrutas' belief that the Confederacy has obliterated their homeworld, which intensifies their despair. While working at an atmosphere-filtration turbine station alongside the Togruta, Rex and Kenobi rally the colonists with the news that Kiros has been liberated, giving them a reason to endure and survive the ordeal. The Togrutas' response to that news, perceived as hope, is what leads the keeper to call Rex and Kenobi to the command center for execution, instead of Count Dooku ordering him to do so, as is the case in the episode.",

        "content": "# Rex - The mystery of Tup and Fives[]\n\nWith Skywalker's approval, Tup and his hovergurney were moved to the Star Destroyer's hangar. Rex, Fives, and Skywalker saw Tup off as he was ushered onto a waiting Nu-class attack shuttle for transport back to Kamino. Just as Tup's shuttle was about to leave the system with an escorting quartet of ARC-170 starfighters, Admiral Yularen and the bridge team aboard Skywalker's flagship lost contact with the craft. Rex joined Fives and Skywalker aboard an Eta-class shuttle to investigate the last known location of Tup's transport, and there they were met with a grim surprise: The shuttle's hull had been breached, with Rex theorizing that it was the work of Separatist buzz droids. Once they had outfitted themselves in breathmask survival gear, Rex and Fives joined Skywalker in entering the drifting Nu-class shuttle, finding nothing but carnage within, as the crew and embarked clone trooper detail had all been massacred. Amidst the floating bodies, Skywalker found Tup's hovergurney with its restraints severed. Fives believed that the Separatists' kidnapping of Tup indicated that they were responsible for his breakdown, and Skywalker did not rule out that possibility. Returning to their Eta-class shuttle, Rex and his comrades followed Tup's exceedingly faint tracking signal to the Separatist-held side of the space station, specifically the enemy's principal hangar. Skywalker decided that the shuttle would drop them off at the hangar, and he, Rex, and Fives would space-walk on their own from there.\n\nUpon reaching the Separatists' hangar, Rex and his comrades found it was occupied with hundreds of battle droids, some of which were loading Tup onto a Maxillipede shuttle. Rex voiced skepticism regarding their chances of surviving a direct confrontation with the droid army, earning Skywalker's comparison of his sentiment to that of the perpetually cautions Kenobi. As Tup's shuttle took off, Fives devised the idea of boarding the vessel via ascension cables, thereby avoiding the numerous droids in the hangar. Rex and Fives each attached a grappling extension to one of their blaster pistols and rappelled onto the shuttle as it passed overhead, with Rex bringing along Skywalker. After entering the airlock, Rex and the others broke into the main cabin and took down the BX-series droid commandos guarding the barely conscious Tup. While Skywalker defeated the shuttle's commander, the super tactical droid Kraken, Rex fought his way to the cockpit and gunned down the pair of OOM pilot battle droids at the controls. With Rex at the helm, they immediately piloted the captured shuttle to Skywalker's flagship, since Fives noted that the ailing Tup's life signs were dropping, indicating that he was close to death. Sending Tup to Kamino was paramount for him to be cured.\n\nOnce Rex and the others were back aboard Skywalker's flagship, a Consular-class cruiser designated as medical frigate 517 was prepared as Tup's transport. Skywalker assigned Rex to oversee the transfer, requiring a full report upon his return from Kamino. Prior to their departure, Fives asked for permission to accompany Rex to Kamino, as Tup was his best friend. Rex granted Fives' request but ordered him to proceed by the book so as to avoid further setbacks. Once they had arrived on rainy Kamino, Rex and Fives ushered Tup and his hovergurney into Tipoca City's Military Complex, where they were received by Shaak Ti and Doctor Nala Se, Chief Medical Scientist of Kamino and one of the principal engineers of the Grand Army's cloning program. While Se and a team of clone troopers took Tup to an observation room, Ti informed Fives that he would be undergoing a complete medical exam. She reasoned that if a virus was the cause of Tup's behavior, then Fives had likely been exposed to the same contagion. Although apprehensive about leaving his friend's side, Fives agreed to do so if it would help pinpoint a cure for Tup. After Ti informed him that Skywalker had ordered him back to the war zone, Rex told Fives to take care of himself as well as Tup before departing from Kamino.",

        "content": "# Rex - Serving under Skywalker[]\n\nServing closely with Skywalker throughout the Clone Wars, Rex absorbed much from the Jedi General's style of leadership and daring improvisation. He learned to think on his feet, to consider methods outside of the regulation manuals, and to never surrender or let seemingly overwhelming odds dissuade him on the battlefield. He adopted Skywalker's inclination for unorthodox combat tactics, which often yielded spectacular results against the enemy. Rex was as headstrong and as brave as Skywalker, with full confidence in his own abilities, and it was the duo's similar lack of \"by-the-book\" methods that made them such an excellent team. He shared Skywalker's aggression, free thought, and occasional recklessness\u2014a combination that got them both in and out of trouble. From his service with Jedi officers on the war front, Rex regarded them as figures of authority and learned to both respect and never doubt their resolve or powers. In turn, the Republic's Jedi Generals came to rely on him on the front lines, and his performance as an honorable military leader effected him becoming well-respected by Jedi officers and clone troopers alike. However, he sometimes disapproved of the preference to debating over fighting that some Jedi possessed. On the other hand, Skywalker matched Rex in bravery, aggression, and decisiveness, and the general's \"soldiery\" traits helped Rex to form something of a friendship with him.\n\nRex worked closely with Skywalker on the battlefield, offering thought-out suggestions about strategy as he saw fit, and respected Skywalker because he put himself on the line with his troops. Even though Skywalker at times maintained an authoritative demeanor of command, Rex did not resent such conduct on his part, knowing that respecting the chain of command was an integral component of an officer's performance. Like the rest of the 501st's Torrent Company, he was truly devoted to Skywalker and was proud of the trust that his general invested in him. Skywalker in turn thought highly of Rex, believing him to be the finest and most loyal trooper with whom he had worked, and introduced him as such to General Pong Krell. As a soldier, Rex was loyal to Skywalker not only on the battlefield, but also on a personal level. When Skywalker was away during Leveler's shakedown cruise, Rex kept him regularly apprised with the situation to prevent his general from being caught out of the loop. In addition, when Skywalker pursued fugitives Rako Hardeen, Cad Bane, and Moralo Eval to Nal Hutta without the consent of the Jedi High Council, Rex made an effort to conceal his general's unauthorized undertaking from Mace Windu.\n\nRex was not upset when Skywalker was unable to aid Torrent Company during the Battle of Teth. True to his belief that the mission always came first, he understood his general's mandate to return Rotta the Huttlet to Tatooine. Furthermore, he looked up to Skywalker as a role model; when serving away from his general, he would sometimes consider, as he did more than once during the battle on Ereesus, what Skywalker would have done in his position to ensure success. The time that Rex spent with Skywalker was such that he even became aware that his general had feelings for Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, though he was unaware of the full extent of their attachment. On some occasions, he pitied Skywalker, who was often prone to guilt and regret when forced to prioritize other assignments over serving alongside his captain. He became used to Skywalker's personal style of command and worked well with his Jedi General.\n\nBesides his friendship with Skywalker, Rex was acquainted with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Skywalker's own former Master. Rex made it a goal to procure a laugh from Kenobi on the battlefield with his sarcastic jokes, though he did not have much success. In spite of his respect for his Jedi officers, Rex did not share all of their beliefs, particularly regarding the Jedi Code. Whereas Kenobi restrained himself from taking the life of the unarmed Keeper Agruss despite the Zygerrian's crimes as a slaver, Rex had no such reservations and acted decisively, killing the keeper. Rex also came to fully trust R2-D2, Skywalker's personal astromech droid.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Infiltrating the Imperial Interdictor[]\n\nAn opportunity for Rex to resolve his differences with Kanan Jarrus arose after Ezra Bridger and Commander Jun Sato's CR90 corvette Liberator were captured by an Imperial Interdictor during a mission to the Del Zennis system. Prior to their capture, Sato had warned the other rebels that the Empire had a new warship capable of pulling ships out of hyperspace. Under the orders of Phoenix Leader Hera, Rex along with Kanan and Chopper were to infiltrate the Imperial warship and rescue Bridger and Sato. For this mission, Rex and Kanan were to disguise themselves as stormtroopers while Chopper was painted black to mimic an Imperial communications droid.\n\nWhen Kanan expressed unease about working with Rex, he reassured him that he knew which side he was on. After Zeb brought two captured sets of stormtrooper armor, Rex complained that the new armor was junk compared to the armor he had worn during the Clone Wars. For their mission, Rex, Kanan, and Chopper used a stolen Sentinel-class landing craft to travel to the Del Zennis system, which they learned had been classified by the Imperial authorities as a restricted testing area. While traveling through hyperspace, the two men argued about their mission. While Kanan wanted to find their people and get them out of Imperial custody, Rex insisted on disabling the new ship as well since it could pose a threat to the Rebellion.\n\nUpon approaching the Imperial Interdictor, Rex conned the Imperial scanners by telling them that his shuttle was having engine problems. Using emergency protocols he and Commander Cody had invented, they gained permission to dock in the Imperial Interdictor. After landing, Kanan used a Jedi mind trick to convince the stormtroopers guard in the hangar to let them through. Accessing a terminal, they learned through Chopper that Ezra was being transferred to a secure cell; meaning that the Empire had learned his identity. Disguised as stormtroopers, the three rebels made their way to Ezra's cell only to discover that the young Jedi had already broken free and locked his captors in his holding cell.\n\nMistaking Rex and Kanan for stormtroopers, Ezra stunned them with his lightsaber-blaster. When Rex and Kanan recovered, Ezra tried to save face by claiming that they had been involved in a big firefight. Chopper, however, played a holographic recording of what actually happened. While Kanan was furious, Rex laughed it off and suggested that Ezra should have set his blaster to kill in case it was not them. When Rex and Kanan broke into an argument about whether to limit their mission to rescuing their rebel comrades or destroying the ship as well, an irritated Ezra broke off and accompanied Chopper on a mission to sabotage the Imperial Interdictor's gravity well projectors.\n\nDisguised as stormtroopers, Rex and Kanan continued their mission to rescue their rebel comrades. When they stumbled on a stormtrooper patrol, Rex advised caution but Kanan decided to attack them. During the firefight, Rex complained that he could not see through his stormtrooper helmet and threw it at one of his opponents, knocking him out. After braving heavy fire, Rex and Kanan finally reached the detention cell holding Commander Sato and his crew. They decided to make their way back to Commander Sato's CR90 corvette Liberator. On the way, they were attacked by more stormtroopers. Rex decided to buy his rebel comrades more time by holding off their pursuers and locking the blast doors.\n\nRex took on the remaining stormtroopers in single-hand combat only to be stunned. Captured, Rex was brought before the Interdictor's commanding officer, Admiral Brom Titus. Recognizing Rex based on his code number, Titus tried to win Rex over by offering him immunity and reinstatement at an Imperial Academy if he would convince his compatriots to surrender. However, Rex rejected Titus' terms and the Admiral ordered an interrogator droid to torture him to death while two stormtroopers pinned him down over a round portal. Meanwhile, the other rebels reached Sato's corvette safely. After hearing Rex being tortured through the Force, Kanan decided to rescue Rex.\n\nBefore Admiral Titus could finish Rex off, Kanan entered the command bridge disguised as a stormtrooper and opened fire on Titus' men. After freeing Rex, the two men escaped on an escape pod and boarded Commander Sato's corvette. They attempted to flee into hyperspace but were again pulled out by the Imperial Interdictor. However, Chopper had rigged the Interdictor's gravity well projectors to draw in everything nearby including two escort light cruisers. These light cruisers crashed into the Interdictor; destroying it in a fiery explosion. Rex and the other rebels escaped into hyperspace in the nick of time. Following their escape, Commander Sato praised Rex, Kanan, and Ezra for rescuing him and his crew. Rex also thanked Kanan, who had finally overcome his animosity towards clone troopers. As a gesture of reconciliation, the two men saluted each other before they parted company.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - A comrade turned fugitive[]\n\nAs Rex and Skywalker joined Fox outside the base to oversee the external security patrols, Fox reported that they had spotted Tano heading for the industrial pipeline that led away from the complex. Skywalker ordered all of the shock troopers to set their blasters to stun mode, intending to take her alive. Rex, Skywalker, and Fox caught up on foot with the search teams just as they surrounded Tano near the pipeline's central viaduct. In spite of being outnumbered, Tano continued to evade capture, carving a hole into an adjacent pipe with her lightsaber and jumping into it. Rex followed his comrades in rappelling down into the pipe network in pursuit of Tano. With spotlights activated, he and Fox searched for the fugitive Padawan amidst the shadows of the sewers. During the hunt, they were separated from Skywalker, who found Tano first and tried to convince her to turn herself in. However, Tano was adamant against doing so and was determined to clear her name. Just as Rex and Fox found Master and Padawan at the edge of the water pipe, they were unable to prevent the latter from jumping out of the shaft. Rex and the others could do nothing but watch as she landed on a freighter far below, descending into the cavernous shipping portal of the Coruscant underworld.\n\nWith Tano now being framed for the murder of the clone officers at the military base in addition to the homicide of Letta Turmond, Tarkin concluded that Tano was further responsible for the bombing of the Jedi Temple, given that Turmond had admitted to collaborating with a dissident Jedi while Tano was interrogating her. The evidence even compelled the Jedi High Council to consider the possibility that Tano was guilty, resulting in Master Yoda dispatching two teams of Coruscant Guard shock troopers to detain Tano. Rex and Skywalker headed the first team, while Plo Koon and Commander Wolffe received command of the second. Both squads set out for the Coruscant underworld aboard a pair of Republic police gunships. As they crossed the ecumenopolis en route to the underworld's shipping portal, Rex interfaced with the local Coruscant Underworld Police, who oversaw security on the lower levels and claimed to have sighted Tano in the vicinity of Level 1312. Rex relayed the report to Skywalker, who ordered their search party's pilots to set course for that area as they descended into the underworld. Just as they neared the landing deck of Level 1313, Skywalker ordered the police gunships to train their spotlights on terminal 24, where Rex and the others spotted Tano in mid-conversation with an unexpected confederate: Asajj Ventress, who had ventured into bounty hunting and reformed her ways\u2014to a degree\u2014since being jilted by Count Dooku.\n\nSkywalker immediately jumped out of the police gunship and gave pursuit on foot, though Ventress cut him off by activating terminal 24's ray shield before bolting out of sight with Tano. In response, Skywalker sent out the search party's probe droids in search of the fugitive pair. The probes eventually located Tano and Ventress on Level 1312, where Wolffe and his team of Coruscant Guard troops attempted but failed to subdue the pair. In the meantime, Rex remained with his shock troopers aboard their police gunship and continued to monitor reports from the Underworld Police, hoping to come across another lead as to Tano and Ventress's whereabouts. When Rex heard word of suspicious activity on Level 1315, Skywalker had their police gunship adjust course for that area. After regrouping en route with Koon and Wolffe, Rex and Skywalker proceeded with their soldiers to the abandoned munitions warehouse where the police report had originated. Wolffe was the first one on the scene and\u2014upon sighting Tano\u2014stunned her at point-blank range before she could emit more than a few words. Upon further examination of the vicinity, Wolffe found that Tano had been inspecting several crates of nano-droids, identical to the ones that had been used in the bombing of the Jedi Temple.",

        "content": "# Rex - Inconsistencies[]\n\nIn June 2008, initial merchandising material for the television series indicated that Rex was an Advanced Recon Commando, but that rank was not repeated in subsequent material and is therefore assumed to be an error. Furthermore, Rex was listed as a clone commander in Star Wars Insider 103's The Clone Wars: A Who's Who Guide, the Jedi Alliance Prima Official Game Guide, the Wizards of the Coast sourcebook The Clone Wars Campaign Guide, Star Wars: The Clone Wars Activity Annual: Summer Edition 2009, The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 43, and the StarWars.com Encyclopedia entry for Saleucami, along with numerous issues of The Official Star Wars Fact File. Part 2 of the Fact File remake referred to Rex as a sergeant on one occasion, with the error being repeated in a revised issue. Yet in all other Star Wars material, Rex is portrayed as a clone captain, which this article reflects.\n\nDue to his rank as a captain, Rex's command over the 501st Legion lacks correlation with the Republic Grand Army's Order of Battle, as detailed in Star Wars Legends. Per The Essential Guide to Warfare, a clone captain is in command of a company, while a senior clone commander would command a legion like the 501st. Some source material correctly reflects the system: The 501st Legion's StarWars.com Databank entry stated that Rex led the core group of the 501st, while The Clone Wars novel series established him as the leader of Torrent Company, a 501st unit. Yet other publications\u2014including The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide and his StarWars.com Databank and Encyclopedia entries\u2014simplified his role to the overall leader of the 501st, subordinate only to Anakin Skywalker. To date, no official explanation has been provided to resolve the inconsistency.\n\nThere has also been a discrepancy regarding the extent of Rex's mental resistance abilities. The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide suggested that Rex was not able to resist the mind trick that Asajj Ventress performed on him during the Battle of Teth, but the novelization of The Clone Wars film maintained that he was indeed able to avoid succumbing to her mind influence. This article assumes that the latter's interpretation is correct.\n\nThe junior novelization of The Clone Wars film stated that Rex had the brown hair customary of clone troopers, which is inconsistent with the majority of other canonical material, in which his hair was depicted as bleached blond. In Slaves of the Republic - Chapter 6: Escape from Kadavo, Obi-Wan Kenobi addresses a clone trooper who is wearing Rex's customized blue-and-white armor as \"Cody.\" The Decoded re-airing of the first season episode \"Jedi Crash\" mistakenly referred to Commander Bly as Rex on one occasion. Also, the children's activity section of Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic 6.25 incorrectly identified the Advanced Recon Commando Havoc from the episode \"ARC Troopers\" as Rex. In addition to erroneously referring to Rex as a commander, Part 51 of The Official Star Wars Fact File mislabels an image of Clone Captain Keeli as Rex.\n\nIn a young-reader adaptation of the second season episode \"The Zillo Beast,\" written for Star Wars: The Clone Wars Activity Annual: Summer Edition 2010, Rex initially stays with Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu, and Dr. Sionver Boll at the Doge's Palace on Malastare to oversee the Battle of Malastare, instead of leading the clone troopers on the battlefield as he does in the episode. Also, during the adaptation of \"The Zillo Beast Strikes Back,\" Rex orders the LAAT/i gunships to fire their Malastarian fuel bombs at the Zillo Beast during the battle at the Republic Executive Building, whereas a clone trooper pilot delivers the order during the episode. In both cases, this article follows the episodes' interpretation of events.\n\nIn the 2011 third season episode \"The Citadel,\" while preparing to undergo carbon-freezing to bypass the Citadel's defenses, Rex and Skywalker both state that they have not yet undergone the process. That contradicts the events of the 2008 comic Shipyards of Doom, in which they utilize the process to infiltrate Gwori's droid-manned blockade. Dave Filoni and then\u2013Head Writer Henry Gilroy initially developed the carbon-freezing tactic during production on the television series' first season, though Gilroy instead incorporated it into Shipyards of Doom. Until official clarification rectifies the inconsistency, this article\u2014for the sake of preserving all canonical material\u2014assumes that Rex and Skywalker's dialogue in \"The Citadel\" is in error.\n\nThe 2011 Battle of Umbara story arc of the television series' fourth season utilized \"CT-7567\" as Rex's clone designation instead of CC-7567, which various material had relied upon since his debut in 2008. A November 11, 2011, update to Rex's Encyclopedia entry on StarWars.com verified that the change was intentional and canonized the new CT-7567 designation.\n\nIn The Essential Reader's Companion, an illustration of a scene from No Prisoners depicted Rex in his trademark blue-marked armor despite the novel portraying him in standard-issue white armor. As a further complication, the image depicted Ahsoka Tano in her post\u2013Season Three older outfit, despite the novel's early occurrence in the chronology of The Clone Wars.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - The mystery of Tup and Fives[]\n\nWhen the Republic set its sights on seizing the planet Ringo Vinda, Rex helped Skywalker lead the 501st infantry that was assigned to the campaign. The Republic and Separatist forces clashed for control of the orbital space station that encircled the entire world, eventually becoming based out of opposite sections of the facility. Rex and his comrades became locked in combat with the Separatist battle group for at least five rotations, but it was not until the arrival of reinforcements under the command of twin Jedi Generals Tiplee and Tiplar that they began to make headway toward breaking the ongoing stalemate. As part of their renewed offensive, Rex and Skywalker led the 501st in pressing through one of the station's hallways, while Tiplee and Tiplar's men concentrated on repulsing the droid forces in an adjacent passage. Once they had reached a communications center, Rex and Skywalker regrouped with the twin Jedi Generals and claimed the facility for their own use. They next set their sights on a command center up ahead, out of which the Separatist commander, Admiral Trench, was operating.\n\nThe Jedi initiated phase two of their battle strategy: While Tiplee and Tiplar would each lead their men to Trench's command post via the outer two of three passageways, Rex and Skywalker would oversee a 501st advance through the middle corridor. Upon learning from Tiplee and Tiplar's clone officer, Commander Doom, that his men were severely depleted, Skywalker transferred Fives, Tup, and ten other soldiers from the 501st to Doom and Tiplar's squad. With that, Rex joined Skywalker in spearheading the 501st's push, blasting through a number of B1 battle droids in the central passage. The hallway eventually opened into a large room in front of Trench's post, and Rex and the others were faced with DSD1 dwarf spider droids and super battle droid rocket troopers. As they made progress toward Trench's position, Tup\u2014in a trance-like state\u2014executed Tiplar at point-blank range. Tup's shocking exploit, combined with the appearance of a squad of droidekas, crumbled the Republic's advance, and Skywalker ordered a full retreat, with Fives taking Tup into custody. Once Rex and the others had fallen back to the communications center, they welded shut the blast doors to cut off the pursuant battle droids, then turned to the perplexing matter of Tup.\n\nAlongside Fives, Kix, and Skywalker, Rex proceeded to interrogate the restrained Tup. Slipping back into his puzzling trance, Tup began to state that \"good soldiers follow orders\" before attacking Tiplee, who, undeterred, telekinetically repelled him with the Force. Skywalker decided to have Tup transferred to the medical bay of one of the Republic fleet's Star Destroyers before he tried to harm anyone else. Once Kix had completed a series of scans on Tup, the mystery deepened. After Rex, Skywalker, Fives, and Tiplee entered the ward, Tup\u2014who had been strapped to a bed\u2014questioned Fives about what had happened to him, evidently displaying no knowledge of his murder of Tiplar. Tup then began to panic, and a 2-1B medical droid promptly sedated him. At Skywalker's prompting, Kix reported that Tup had passed all of his scans, so Kix believed that Tup's behavior was the result of combat-related stress. Rex disagreed with Kix's diagnosis of an emotional breakdown, since all of them as clone troopers had been designed to withstand high amounts of stress, and Fives agreed. Rex and the others continued their conversation in the hallway outside, entertaining the possibility that the Separatists could have engineered Tup's breakdown by way of a virus\u2014as Tiplee put it, biological warfare. Still, Kix advised that Tup undergo extensive examination back on Kamino, the only place with facilities that were equipped for that level of surgical scrutiny.",

From the base's command center, Rex commanded operations to deliver shipments to the base and to establish sensor beacons that would serve as warning beacons for intruders. While Rex found the planet hot, dry, and unpleasant, he conceded that there was nothing trying to kill them. Later, he and Wren ventured to the base's northern perimeter to investigate the disappearance of Lieutenant Dicer, who had disappeared after planting her sensor marker.\n\nUnder Hera's orders, Rex and Wren traveled there on the shuttle Phantom. Upon arriving, they found Dicer's helmet but saw no sign of the rebel. Soon, the two rebels were attacked by several large spidery creatures called krykna. Wren held off the creatures, but Rex was taken captive. The krykna carried him down to their underground lair where he was held in the mandibles of a sleeping krykna which hung suspended from the top of the cavern. Sabine and the Spectres freed him but were pursued back to the surface by the krykna.\n\nRex and his companions made it back to the Ghost, but the starship was held down by a large web woven by the krykna. As the rebels fought to break their way out of the web, Rex and Chopper aided in the defense of the ship by fighting off a krykna intruder trying to breach the rear hatch. While Rex kicked and pushed the creature out, Chopper closed the rear doors. After escaping the krykna, Rex suggested reporting to Commander Sato that the base was unsafe. However, Syndulla responded that they had poured much effort into finding the base and should not give up. At Jarrus's suggestion, the rebels erected a fence consisting of sensor markers around the base the following day.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Rescuing Echo[]\n\nAfter the Separatist Admiral Trench made advances against Republic forces during the Battle of Anaxes, Rex theorized that the Separatists had captured his comrade Echo, who was presumed dead, and that the Separatists were combating his strategies through him. Rex and Commander Cody joined forces with an elite squad called Clone Force 99 (known as the \"Bad Batch\"); which consisted of Sergeant Hunter, the giant demolitions expert Wrecker, the sniper Crosshair, and the equipment specialist Tech. The clones raided a Separatist Cyber Center on Anaxes and discovered that it was receiving an audio signal from Skako Minor that was beeping Echo's clone trooper number. This confirmed Rex's suspicions that Echo might still be alive.\n\nArmed with this information, Rex traveled to Skako Minor with Clone Force 99 and Anakin Skywalker on the Marauder. Before going, however, Skywalker spoke with his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and had Rex stand by to make sure no one knew. Although General Kenobi asked where Skywalker was, Rex tried to lie about what his General was doing. After Skywalker was done speaking with her, he and Rex left for Skako with the Bad Batch. After landing, Skywalker was kidnapped by a large flying reptile called a keeradak which deposited him in a Poletec village. Rex and the Bad Batch traveled to the Poletec village where they made peace with the villagers and convinced them to release Skywalker. With the aid of Poletec scouts, the clones and Skywalker traveled to the Techno Union city of Purkoll. During the journey, the clone troopers traced Echo's signal. When Crosshair disdainfully said that Echo was \"just another reg,\" Rex attacked the commando. Anakin broke up the fight and dismissed the others to counsel Rex alone, saying that he had to face the reality that Echo may be dead. Rex told his general that he tried never to dwell on the death on a friend and brother, but that he was certain that he had heard Echo.\n\nThe clones traced Echo's signal to a tower and infiltrated it. Inside, they received a hologram message from the Techno Union leader Wat Tambor, who announced that he had used the algorithm to lure them into a trap. When Tambor charged them with violating the Techno Union's neutrality, Rex responded that Tambor had already breached the Union's neutrality by bringing a Republic prisoner to Skako Minor. Tambor sent several D1-series aerial battle droids to attack them, but the clones and Skywalker defeated them. Rex and Tech forced their way inside a stasis chamber and found Echo. Echo was alive, but many of his body parts had been replaced with prosthetics, and he was kept in an induced coma.\n\nRex and Tech freed Echo from the chamber after some difficulty. However, the clones and Skywalker were surrounded by Techno Union forces and unable to call for help since they were on an unsanctioned mission. When Tambor dispatched a Decimator to destroy the intruders, Rex, the other clones, and Skywalker fled through an exhaust pipe. Wrecker then planted several detonators which destroyed the Decimator and the chamber. While crossing a pipe, the clones and Skywalker escaped on four-winged Keeradaks and returned to the Poletec village.\n\nAt the village, the clones, Skywalker, and the Poletec villagers joined forces to destroy several D-wing droids and octuptarra tri-droids that Tambor had dispatched after them. During the battle, Rex disabled one octuptarra by firing into its eye sensor. Following the battle, Echo thanked Rex for returning for him, but Rex simply stated that it was what brothers did and apologized for the time it took. Rex also expressed his hope that things would be just like their old times together. The clones and Skywalker then headed back to Anaxes.\n\nAfter returning to Anaxes, Echo devised a plan which involved infiltrating Admiral Trench's dreadnought and feeding the Separatist systems with false information in order to secure a Republic victory on Anaxes. Rex, Echo, Skywalker, and Force 99 infiltrated Trench's warship using the Marauder while Republic forces under Jedi Generals Windu and Kenobi attacked the Separatist assembly plant. The clones and Skywalker infiltrated the dreadnought's interface unit and fed false information to Admiral Trench. Echo brought all Separatist forces to the assembly plant and then used a feedback pulse to shut them down.\n\nWhen Admiral Trench realized the deception, he activated a time bomb in the factory's fusion generator. Rex and his fellow clones fought their way through several battle droids and returned to the Marauder. Meanwhile, Skywalker killed Admiral Trench while Mace Windu used the Force to deactivate the bomb with the help of information supplied by Echo. Rex, his fellow clones, and Skywalker then fled Trench's dreadnought before Wrecker detonated it. At Fort Anaxes, Rex supported Echo's decision to join the Bad Batch and forfeit the medals which had been prepared for them and Echo, with his new squad-mates, saluted the Clone Captain.\n\n",

Rex and the men confronted Krell, who was surprised that he had figured it out. Krell, believing Rex and his men to be committing mutiny, refused to be arrested and ignited his lightsabers. After a short fight, Krell leapt from the tower and quickly incapacitated the force of clones that was waiting outside, fleeing into the jungle. Rex and his men pursued the Besalisk. Rex was alerted by a trooper that had located him, but Krell tore through several clones with ease, taunting Rex all the while. However, after many casualties, Krell was tricked by Tup into walking towards a vixus, giving them an opportunity to stun Krell. Rex and his men placed Krell in the brig. During his questioning, Rex learned that Krell was trying to undermine the Republic so that Dooku or his master would make him his new apprentice and rule Umbara. When news came that Kenobi and 212th had taken the capital, Rex and the others decided to execute Krell. At first, Rex hesitated but Krell was then killed by Dogma. Dogma was then taken into custody, but he and Rex shared a nod. Fives informed the Clone Captain that the last Umbaran holdouts had been defeated and the fight for Umbara was over, but Rex wondered aloud about what the point of the suffering was and what would happen to him and his brothers when the war ended.",

        "content": "# Cody - Personality and traits[]\n\nA loyal and no-nonsense commander, Cody shared easy camaraderie with General Kenobi. His battlefield exploits and good leadership skills had earned him respect of both clones and Jedi alike.\n\nCody was a cautious trooper and a brilliant strategist, leading the 212th to victory after victory. He was often teamed up with Captain Rex and enjoyed a friendship with him. Cody possessed excellent close combat skills, often incorporating body slams, kicks and punches against his enemies besides using his blaster. Cody was also well versed in hand-to-hand fighting, and was able to knock out Slick with a single punch.\n\nCody was extremely proficient with blasters. His preference for a standard blaster over dual DC-17 hand blasters allowed him to make precision shots at longer ranges. Cody had received additional training as a commander, and was capable of headshotting enemies without steadying his blaster with his second hand. He was also able to shoot a barrel which Obi-Wan Kenobi had thrown at high speeds, and take down multiple droids a considerable distance away with rapid, well-placed shots. Cody also shot the blaster out of another person's hand before he could react, showing excellent reflexes and coordination.\n\nCody displayed a dislike for standard Commander gear such as kamas and chest pauldrons, instead choosing to incorporate various unorthodox gear such as a jetpack, laser sight, and vibroknife on his armor.\n\nWhile Cody had developed a sense of respect for those who considered him as a friend, like most other clones, his thoroughly ingrained loyalty to the Republic was the dominating trait of his character.\n\nLater in his life, Cody became cynical and bitter because of the changes that were introduced by the New Order, specifically the alterations to the Imperial Military. Though a proud veteran of the Clone Wars, Cody felt nothing except contempt for the Stormtrooper Corps. As one of the last remaining clones of Jango Fett, he felt isolated and alone in his hatred for the birth-born human recruits who came to dominate the ranks of a military that was once the exclusive province of Fett's progeny. From Cody's point of view, enlisted personnel were inferior soldiers compared to the original clone troopers. He regarded the former Grand Army of the Republic as a once truly incredible fighting force, and so he resented the reforms which he believed to be responsible for a significant decrease in the combat effectiveness of the Grand Army's Imperial successor.\n\nThus he developed a sense of nostalgia for his past as a commander of clone troopers; enlisted stormtroopers were nothing other than expendable resources to him. Furthermore, Cody also felt that his low regard for birth-born troopers would have been shared by his genetic template, Jango Fett, had he still been alive. Ultimately, Cody was convinced that Fett would have killed the enlisted troops if he had lived to see what had become of his legacy.\n\nWhen Sidious issued Order 66 and labelled Kenobi a traitor to the Republic, Cody's indoctrination overcame nearly all his loyalty to the Jedi and as a result, Cody turned on his long time comrade and superior Obi-Wan. Sometime after the Clone Wars, however, Cody recorded himself in his old armor, showing regret for betraying the Jedi and stating that Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Ahsoka in particular had truly been heroes.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Leading clone of The Clone Wars[]\n\nThe character of Captain Rex was created for the 2008 Star Wars: The Clone Wars film and television series, with his place in the spotlight turning him into a fan favorite among Star Wars enthusiasts of all ages. Prior to his debut in the television series, he was featured in February 2008 as a promotional mail-order figure that kicked off Hasbro's Star Wars: The Clone Wars toy line. After his \"CC-7567\" designation was attributed in his Databank entry on StarWars.com in May 2008, Rex made his first appearance in Star Wars canon in The Clone Wars film's novelization and junior novelization, which were published on July 26, 2008. As the television series' primary clone trooper character, Rex played a part throughout the series' five broadcast seasons, which aired from October 2008 to March 2013. He also appeared in several episodes of the series' sixth season, which was released on Netflix in March 2014.\n\nVoice actor Dee Bradley Baker provided Rex's voice, as well as those of all other clone troopers, throughout the television series. To make Rex distinctive, Baker portrayed him with a somewhat deeper voice than the other clone characters based on his confidence and aggression. Baker and Series Supervising Director Dave Filoni developed the idea that Rex was the central personality type of all clone characters, whom they all aspired to embody, while others had an excess of various traits. Baker's intended distinction for Rex was prominent during clone-centric episodes, such as \"Rookies\" and \"The Hidden Enemy\" from the first season, as well as \"The Deserter\" from the second season, all of which featured Rex as a lead character. The latter two episodes contrasted him with Sergeant Slick and Cut Lawquane, two clone characters who were shown to have abandoned their service to the Republic for different reasons.\n\nRex's popularity and character development over time were such that Filoni voiced the production team's conscious effort to continue exploring his story within the series. In April 2011, Filoni stated that the fates of Rex and Ahsoka Tano were the two storylines that he was the most intent on pursuing, given both characters' inseparability and their absence from the chronologically later film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.\n\nIn the series' fourth season, Rex was spotlighted in a four-part story arc, which focused on the Battle of Umbara in the episodes \"Darkness on Umbara,\" \"The General,\" \"Plan of Dissent,\" and \"Carnage of Krell.\" The episode arc evolved his character by bringing him into conflict with General Pong Krell, while also showcasing his performance as a leader.\n\nA heroic character in the television series, Rex has achieved considerable popularity with the Star Wars fan base, particularly with younger fans. In August 2010, he was voted the thirty-sixth most popular character in Star Wars canon on IGN.com, beating Ahsoka Tano, who was ranked as forty-third most popular. In the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Magazine's 2014 \"Reader Awards\" contest, Rex\u2014alongside Yoda\u2014was a runner-up in the \"Most Heroic Hero\" category, which fans chose from the television series' cast of characters; the overall category winner was Obi-Wan Kenobi. Rex has also been included in StarWars.com's This Is Madness, an annual character popularity tournament imitating March Madness. In the 2013 bracket, he lost within the first round to Ahsoka Tano, but the 2014 bracket saw him reach the \"Duel of the Eights\" quarterfinal round, in which he lost to Han Solo.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Slaves of the Republic[]\n\nThe television series' fourth season adapted the 2008 Slaves of the Republic comic book story arc into a three-episode arc: \"Kidnapped,\" \"Slaves of the Republic,\" and \"Escape from Kadavo,\" with Henry Gilroy\u2014previous Head Writer and the author of the original comics\u2014scripting the episodes alongside Steven Melching. Aside from the visual difference of incorporating the new character models for Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and Obi-Wan Kenobi from the third season and Rex's Phase II model from previous fourth season episodes, the trio of episodes transcribed plot elements from the six-part comic story. They are thus treated as the same story, with precedence being given to the television series in cases of inconsistencies.\n\nIn Slaves of the Republic - Chapter 1: The Mystery of Kiros, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi respond to the Confederate invasion of Kiros by launching a counterattack against the droid forces on the planet. The Separatist commander is Xerius Ugg, who was replaced with the Zygerrian Darts D'Nar in \"Kidnapped.\" In the comic, when Skywalker and Tano go to defuse the thermal bombs throughout the capital city, Rex assists them once they come under fire from a sniper droideka at one of the bomb sites, using a sniper rifle to eliminate the droid. That scene is absent from \"Kidnapped,\" in which Skywalker and Tano face off against two sniper droidekas on their own. Furthermore, D'Nar reveals the reason for the disappearance of the Togruta colonists, a role that the Zygerrian Captain Onyx fills in Chapter 2: Slave Traders of Zygerria.\n\nChapter 2: Slave Traders of Zygerria begins with Rex accompanying Skywalker, Tano, Kenobi, and a squad of troopers aboard the Twilight to the black market haven known as the Shi'kar Straits. Amidst the asteroids of the Shi'kar Straits, Rex and the others encounter the Zygerrian slaver vessel Fate's Hand, captained by Onyx. Posing as slavers, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi board the Fate's Hand to acquire what information they can, while Rex and his troops hide behind several crates as backup. When the Jedi give up the ruse, Rex and the clone troopers forsake their cover and initiate a firefight with the Zygerrians. As Skywalker leads Rex, Tano, and some of their men to commandeer the Fate's Hand, more Zygerrians catch them in a crossfire. When a Zygerrian fires a rocket that damages the seal between the two vessels, Tano intentionally seals herself aboard the Fate's Hand, while Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi are stuck on the Twilight with several trapped Zygerrians, who surrender. A dismayed Rex reports Tano's actions to Skywalker and Kenobi, who deduce that she intends to infiltrate the Fate's Hand by acting as a hostage.\n\nRex secures the docking clamps of the Twilight to ensure that they will not be separated from the Fate's Hand. Attempting to break free of the Twilight, Onyx pilots his ship through the asteroid belt, and the Twilight's bottom stabilizer is compromised from a collision with an asteroid. After Skywalker fires at and disables the engines of the Fate's Hand, Tano contacts the Twilight. At Kenobi's direction, she is able to unlock the Zygerrian ship's rear airlock, but Onyx discovers her exploit. Rex and another trooper follow Skywalker and Kenobi on a space-walk to board the Fate's Hand and rescue Tano, but a blixus creature that Onyx has released intercepts them. The blaster-impervious creature kills the other clone trooper and captures the two Jedi in its tentacles before Skywalker in turn kills the beast, halting its rampage. Boarding the Fate's Hand, Rex and the Jedi confront Onyx, who is forced to convey his intelligence regarding the missing Togruta. Onyx reveals what Darts D'Nar does in \"Kidnapped\"\u2014that the Royal Slave Auction is being revived on Zygerria, and the people of Kiros are to be sold into slavery. At Kenobi's behest, Rex takes Onyx to imprison him on the Twilight with the rest of his crew. As a whole, the storyline of Slave Traders of Zygerria underwent substantial revision before being included in \"Kidnapped.\"",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Lola Sayu[]\n\nOne year and nine months after the First Battle of Geonosis, when Jedi Master Even Piell was captured, Rex, appearing via hologram, Cody, Fives, Echo, Kenobi, and Skywalker attended a briefing held by Plo Koon for a mission to rescue Piell from the Citadel on Lola Sayu, where he was imprisoned by the Separatists. In order to get on the planet undetected, Skywalker had the entire rescue team, including Rex, carbon-frozen; before being frozen, Rex confided in Skywalker that he had never gone through the process before, only for Skywalker to admit it was his first time as well.\n\nDespite Rex and Fives's reservations, the team was successfully frozen, surviving the process and being brought aboard Shuttle 81572. The frozen team was smuggled by R2-D2 and three reprogrammed battle droids in a stolen Separatist shuttle. This tactic fooled the life-form scanners of the blockade around the planet, and its crew and the droids landed the shuttle in a cave close to the Citadel prison. After landing, Rex and the others were unfrozen, only to discover that Tano had secretly joined the team, despite having been ordered not to. Since there was no other option, Tano came along, and the team began the mission.\n\nTo get into the facility, the team had to free-climb a wall covered with electromines. This went well until clone trooper Charger stepped on a loose rock and fell straight into a mine, alerting the prison crew of the team's presence. On the way to Piell's cell, the team had to evade several booby traps, one killing another clone trooper, Longshot. The team made it to Piell's cell and destroyed the droids that were guarding Piell, with Rex taking care of the interrogator droid. On the way to rescue Piell the group was located by the Citadel's warden, Osi Sobeck, who activated a large magnet in the ceiling of the hall that pulled all the team's weapons away, as well as Skywalker, due to his cybernetic arm. The team was surrounded by droids.\n\nSkywalker, being attached to the magnet, reclaimed his lightsaber and destroyed the magnet, allowing the team to reclaim their weapons and destroy the droids. Rex shot a surveillance camera, much to Sobeck's frustration, before moving along. After retrieving Piell's officers the group split into two groups while escaping the facility, as both Piell and his captain, Tarkin, knew half of the vital hyperspace coordinates, called Nexus Route. Splitting them up during the escape would make it more difficult for the Separatists to get the full information. Rex joined the group consisting of Skywalker, Tano, Tarkin, Echo, Fives, and two rescued clones. While Kenobi and the other group wreaked havoc on the upper levels, Rex and his group escaped the tower into a series of tunnels on the lower levels.\n\nRex and the others made their way through tunnels fighting off the super battle droids and commando droids. He also defended Ahsoka when Tarkin questioned her experience. They met up with Kenobi's and Piell's team at the airfield. However, their shuttle was destroyed, and ARC trooper Echo was believed to have been killed.\n\nRex and the others headed for a rendezvous point as they were pursued by STAPs and anoobas. During their trek, one of the anoobas killed Piell, and Rex and the others gave him a brief funeral. Upon reaching the rendezvous point, they fought Commandant Sobeck and his droids until Koon arrived. Rex and the others were then taken back to Coruscant.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Returning to Coruscant[]\n\nWhen Rex was contacted by the clone trooper Slip, who sought to escape Imperial service and get offworld, he returned to Coruscant to help his brother. However, when he arrived at their agreed-upon rendezvous, he heard blasterfire and ran to investigate, finding Senator Riyo Chuchi being pursued by an assailant. Rex stunned the attacker and helped up Senator Chuchi, who recognized him from their time together during the Clone Wars. When Rex removed the attacker's helmet, he saw the face of a clone. Together, they decided to question the individual, with Rex bringing them to a repair shop that belonged to his associates, namely Trace and Rafa Martez. Rex questioned the trooper, but he used a suicide shocker to kill himself rather than reveal any information.\n\nSenator Chuchi explained to him that Slip had been caught up in a conspiracy regarding the destruction of Tipoca City and the subsequent cover-up by Vice Admiral Rampart. She also described the context of the incident, namely that the Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill that would see the decommissioning of all clones without pensions or any form of compensation. In response, Rex contacted the Bad Batch to help them acquire evidence to use in the Imperial Senate to charge Rampart. Having learned from Slip that such proof could be located in the bridge Rampart's Star Destroyer, Chuchi told Rex of this and when the Bad Batch arrived, Rex led them on an infiltration mission while Omega joined Chuchi in the Senate building.\n\nRex led the Bad Batch into the Imperial shipyard where Rampart's ship was docked by accessing a maintenance tunnel that found them near the ship. During their journey, Rex told Echo about how more and more of their brothers were waking up to the Empire's treatment of them and needed help, something he was trying to provide them. After sneaking onboard the ship, Tech rerouted power to the bridge so they could access the data, although this triggered a security alarm. Rex and the other clones fought off the clone stormtroopers advancing on them and eventually escaped the ship by crashing it and using an escape pod to the maintenance tunnel. They then piloted a landspeeder to Omega and one of Chuchi's guards, who relayed the data to Senator Bail Organa, who presented it in the Senate. Rampart was subsequently arrested, although the Defense Recruitment Bill would pass following a statement by Emperor Palpatine. Back at the repair shop, Rex lamented that Palpatine was always steps ahead of them making the outcome of the situation unchanged. Senator Chuchi declared that she will continue to fight for clones as their representative in the senate before the Bad Batch departed without Echo who declared his intentions to join Rex in his quest to aid their clone brothers across the galaxy.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Umbara[]\n\nRex, along with Skywalker, Fives, and the rest of the 501st were sent to Umbara to help Masters Tiin, Krell, and Kenobi take its capital, while Tano and Offee fought the space battle. After the initial landing and fighting with the Umbaran militia, Rex and the 501st were placed under the command of Krell when the Chancellor requested Skywalker return to Coruscant. As the troops were pushed hard on a long march, Krell denied them rest despite Rex's protests. When Krell ordered a full-frontal assaults on the capital, he denied Rex's request to carry out Skywalker's plan. During the first attack on the road to the capital, the clones were surrounded, and without cover, suffered heavy losses. As Rex was forced to order a retreat, Krell disdainfully ordered reinforcements and angrily confronted Rex for disobeying him. When Krell roared at Rex, Rex retorted by reminding him that he had a duty to protect the men under his command.\n\nRex, Krell, and the 501st were sent to capture an airbase that was resupplying the capital. Rex was ordered to go through a gorge that would leave them exposed. Rex tried to reason with Krell to no avail. Despite the objections of Fives, Jesse, and the rest of the 501st, Rex convinced his men to carry out Krell's orders. As they made their way through the gorge, they were attacked by the Umbarans' crawler tanks, which they destroyed. They were then confronted by the Umbarans' MHCs, which had heavy armor impervious to their rocket launchers. To combat them, Rex sent Fives and Hardcase to infiltrate their base and use their own Zenuas 33 Umbaran starfighters on the MHCs. Despite Krell's orders to push the attack, Rex and his men held them off until Fives and Hardcase destroyed the MHCs. The base was taken and secured despite the heavy losses.\n\nWhen Kenobi contacted them about the capital's long-range missiles being supplied by a Dual Hemisphere-Omni Support Vessel, Rex proposed that they attack the ship to cut off the supplies. However, Krell proposed attacking the capital despite the missiles, much to Rex's and Kenobi's surprise. Rex was ordered to prepare the men for the attack, despite the heavy casualties. Rex at first complied but was then told of an idea by Fives to use the starfighter codes to infiltrate and destroy the supply ship. However, Krell objected to it. Following a mishap in a hangar, Rex gave Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase permission to carry out the mission. However, he told them that if they were caught, he would not be able to protect them. Rex watched as they took off on their mission and stopped Dogma and Tup from informing Krell. Krell later confronted Rex, who told him that he authorized a reconnaissance mission to make his strategy more efficient. Rex then saw the supply ship's explosion. Rex, Fives, and Jesse were brought before Krell, where he reprimanded them. Despite Rex's objections, Krell had Fives and Jesse taken to the brig for insubordination.\n\nRex spoke with Krell to convince him to spare Fives and Jesse, telling him that the men were with him despite his reckless tactics. Despite this, Krell ordered Rex and his men to execute them, but they refused to do so. Rex and Krell were then contacted by a trooper who informed them that they were ambushed by the Umbarans disguised as clones. Rex was sent to attack the Umbarans. Rex and his men, armed with mortars, went into the jungle, where they were attacked by the troopers. However, Rex examined one of the troopers and discovered they were clones. Rex ran in front of both his men and the troopers, revealing the deception. Rex then spoke with the 212th Attack Battalion platoon leader, Waxer, who revealed that it was Krell who ordered the attack before dying of his wounds.\n\nRex gathered his men and the remainder of Waxer's platoon and told them that they would arrest Krell for treason. Rex and the men confronted Krell, who was surprised that he had figured it out. Krell, believing Rex and his men to be committing mutiny, refused to be arrested and ignited his lightsabers. After a short fight, Krell leapt from the tower and quickly incapacitated the force of clones that was waiting outside, fleeing into the jungle. Rex and his men pursued the Besalisk. Rex was alerted by a trooper that had located him, but Krell tore through several clones with ease, taunting Rex all the while. However, after many casualties, Krell was tricked by Tup into walking towards a vixus, giving them an opportunity to stun Krell. Rex and his men placed Krell in the brig. During his questioning, Rex learned that Krell was trying to undermine the Republic so that Dooku or his master would make him his new apprentice and rule Umbara. When news came that Kenobi and 212th had taken the capital, Rex and the others decided to execute Krell. At first, Rex hesitated but Krell was then killed by Dogma. Dogma was then taken into custody, but he and Rex shared a nod. Fives informed the Clone Captain that the last Umbaran holdouts had been defeated and the fight for Umbara was over, but Rex wondered aloud about what the point of the suffering was and what would happen to him and his brothers when the war ended.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Clone Wars Infinities[]\n\nIn the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Magazine 2's Infinities version of the second season episode \"Brain Invaders,\" brain worms infect both trooper Scythe and Commander Cody in the wake of the Second Battle of Geonosis. While Ahsoka Tano and Kit Fisto contain Scythe and other infected troopers, Cody spreads the parasite among the Republic fleet. Rex, Anakin Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi all fall victim to the worms, which reach the Jedi Order and the Republic government on Coruscant. Only Tano, Fisto, and Barriss Offee have the knowledge to contain the worms, but with the whole of the Republic at the worms' mercy, time begins to run out for the uninfected Jedi.\n\nIn the Infinities version of the third season episode \"The Citadel,\" as presented in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.20, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, Kenobi, and their men are frozen in carbonite as planned to rescue Even Piell from the Citadel. When R2-D2 transports the elite team to the prison, a rogue hyperspace shadow collides with their shuttle, sending them off-course and shorting out R2-D2's circuits. While Rex and his comrades drift in space, locked in perfect hibernation, the Republic is replaced with the first Galactic Empire under the leadership of Emperor-for-life Palpatine. Almost twenty years after their unintentional detour, Rex and the team are found by Bail Organa and other members of the fledgling Alliance to Restore the Republic and are taken to the planet Dantooine to be unfrozen. Although shocked to learn of the intervening events over the last two decades, the Jedi join the Rebel Alliance in resisting the Imperial regime.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - LEGO Star Wars online material[]\n\nIn the LEGO Star Wars: The Clone Wars online comic series, Rex and a squad of clone troopers are assigned to undertake a mission, but battle droids shoot down their LAAT/i gunship on a desert planet. Just as Rex reports that the mission is proceeding as planned, several B1 battle droids and an OG-9 homing spider droid ambush them. After the spider droid knocks over Rex, he and his troops open fire on the droids. While the other troopers attack the droid menace, Rex finds a clone trooper from Batch 82-4 who is avoiding the battle due to his arachnophobia, a trait specific to his batch. The spider droid charges at Rex and the trooper, and the two take refuge in the remains of the gunship. Rex explains to the scared trooper that it is a droid, not an actual spider, and he watches as the soldier takes up arms and defeats the spider droid single-handed. As Rex congratulates his men on their victory, three more spider droids appear.\n\nRex joins Skywalker, Tano, Kenobi, and Rotta the Huttlet in a search for Asajj Ventress. Their team's AT-TE walker finds a squad of IG-100 MagnaGuards and their Rogue-class starfighter on a planet, but a B2 super battle droid and several IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks arrive and blast the walker off its feet. Emerging from their damaged vehicle, Rex, Tano, and Kenobi fight the new arrivals while Skywalker battles the MagnaGuards at the landing platform. Ventress appears with the Death Brick weapon and throws it at the three Jedi before escaping with the battle droids. Rex jumps into the line of fire and blocks the brick, which simply bounces off his head harmlessly. Commander Cody lands in the vicinity with an LAAT/i gunship and transports Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi away from the planet.\n\nRex is later sent with Kenobi, Cody, and a detachment of clone troopers to rescue Skywalker and Tano in a space battle, but a Separatist tractor beam pulls the group to the surface of a nearby planet. R2-D2 is able to open the door of Rex's gunship\u2014which has been jammed from the crash\u2014in time, and Rex arrives with Plo Koon to save Skywalker, Tano, Kenobi, Cody, and their squad of troops from Ventress and an army of battle droids. The Separatists are repelled, and Rex reports R2-D2's actions to Kenobi. Rex is present when Koon is given an award for his valiant efforts in the battle. Later, aboard Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's Venator-class Star Destroyer, Rex and Cody are present when Palpatine fires a clone scout squad in person for their incompetence and failure to find a missing R2-D2. Rex also accompanies Skywalker to Orto Plutonia when the Separatists stage an attack there. Traveling to the surface with Skywalker and several other clone soldiers in containers carrying Freeco bikes, Rex and his comrades defeat the droid infantry on the planet.\n\nIn The Quest for R2-D2 short film, Palpatine personally dispatches Rex and Cody to find R2-D2, who has gone missing in action. On an ice planet, the two clone officers lead a patrol and encounter a squad of B1 and B2 battle droids along with an OG-9 spider droid and an All Terrain Armored Transport. Skidding across the ice, Cody drops a projectile, and Rex swings at the piece with his blaster. The projectile cuts through the droids and hits the AT-AT walker, collapsing it onto the spider droid and overturning a nearby NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer. With their enemies neutralized, the two clones build a Nu-class attack shuttle from the rubble. Rex and Cody then join Skywalker and Tano in raiding a Separatist Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship, where they rescue R2-D2 from Grievous, Ventress, and Count Dooku. As Rex and the others prepare to face off against the Separatists, Yoda and Kenobi arrive. Yoda uses the Force to collapse the floor beneath Dooku, Grievous, and Ventress, sending them into space, and also forms a CR90 corvette. Rex and his comrades uses the craft to escape from the Droid Control Ship shortly before it explodes. Following the victory, Rex and Cody accompany the Jedi to the \"Skywalker World\" theme park. Rex is also featured in the film's tie-in online game, in which he serves as one of the clone trooper enemies for the game's two playable Separatist characters, Dooku and Ventress.\n\nIn the \"Light Side\" campaign of The Yoda Chronicles game, Rex is one of the clone troopers who is made available as an in-game asset to defeat enemies. The only level in which he is offered is the final Coruscant level, in which the player, as Mace Windu, must open the Jedi Archives' Holocron Vault and defeat Grievous within. The player can purchase up to four copies of Rex at one of the level's build points; he is the most expensive clone trooper, with the cheaper ones being a standard trooper and a 501st trooper. However, using him is not required.\n\n",

During the flight to the Jedi Temple, Rex and Wolffe held the comatose Padawan upright while Skywalker and Koon holographically reported back to the High Council. Though Ventress's exact role in the situation remained a mystery, as she had not been present at the Level 1315 warehouse, Tano was still suspected of sedition on account of being found with the nano-droids. By all accounts, the case against Tano was gaining more momentum, since she had nothing but her word to defend her innocence. As a result, the Jedi Council expelled her from the Jedi Order so that she could be put to trial under a Republic military tribunal. Skywalker eventually discovered that Barriss Offee was the true culprit, having orchestrated the Jedi Temple bombing and then framed Tano for her own crimes. Although Offee was arrested and later confessed to her machinations, Tano ultimately decided not to rejoin the Order, resigning her Padawan status and her rank in the Grand Army to find a new path for herself.",

        "content": "# Rex - Battle of Malastare[]\n\nRex accompanied Skywalker, Windu, and Commander Ponds to oversee the Republic's defense of the beleaguered planet, as the Grand Army coveted its vital fuel reserves. The Supreme Chancellor Palpatine responded by authorizing the use of the electro-proton bomb, a creation of Doctor Sionver Boll that would generate an electron field capable of deactivating the entire droid army. Rex was tasked with shoring up the fortifications of the Doge's Palace\u2014the residence of Doge Nakha Urus, the leader of the Dugs\u2014until the bomb was detonated, and he proceeded to the front of the palace's defense lines to command the Republic troops, monitoring the massive droid army's approach with a set of electrobinoculars. Rex held the line with his men, working in tandem with squads of insectomorph-mounted Dug cavaliers to repel the droid infantry.\n\nA starfighter squadron dropped the electro-proton bomb in the middle of the droid army, producing an explosion that transformed into an electromagnetic pulse. The enlarging pulse disabled all of the droids and disrupted the clone troopers' helmet systems for a short time. The bomb also destabilized the surrounding ground, and Rex nearly fell into the expanding sinkhole when he became trapped on an unstable plateau, but managed to jump to higher ground with the help of his troops. While rescue teams searched for the Republic personnel trapped in the crater, Rex joined Skywalker, Windu, Urus, R2-D2, and Doctor Boll at the Doge's Palace, where they reestablished holographic communications with Palpatine. After Windu and Urus conferred with Palpatine on the status of the Republic's fuel treaty with the Dugs' council, Rex reported that they had lost contact with the rescue team in the crater.\n\nAs night fell, Rex met with Skywalker, Windu, and Boll at Urus's palace to discuss the problem of the uncontrollable Zillo Beast with Palpatine. While the Dugs wanted to kill off the Zillo Beast, the Jedi wanted to preserve the creature, as it was one of the last of its near-extinct species. Skywalker devised a plan to knock out the creature with the Republic's RX-200 Falchion-class assault tanks and then transport it off-world. The Republic forces rendered the Zillo Beast unconscious with Skywalker's strategy, Rex returned with Skywalker and Windu to the Doge's Palace, where Urus and the other Dug leaders signed the fuel treaty. Later, Palpatine ordered they bring it to Coruscant for study before its release into the wild.\n\nRex returned to Coruscant with Skywalker, Windu, and Boll aboard an Acclamator-class transport. The Zillo Beast broke out of the Science and Technical Center and began to rampage across the ecumenopolis of Coruscant. As the creature headed for the Republic Executive Building, Rex joined an LAAT/i gunship force led by Kenobi and Windu that had set out to contain the beast. He contacted Skywalker through R2-D2, both of whom were with Palpatine and Padm\u00e9 Amidala in the Chancellor's Suite at the Executive Building, and confirmed that he was to serve with Kenobi for the time being. Yet when Rex, Kenobi, and Windu reached the Senate Plaza with their detachment of clone troopers and stun tanks, they found that the Zillo Beast had taken hold of the H-2 executive shuttle that Palpatine, Skywalker, and Amidala had been using to flee from the Executive Building with R2-D2 and C-3PO.",

        "content": "# Rex - Seizure of Scipio[]\n\nWhen the Confederacy invaded the planet Scipio, the headquarters of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, the Republic Senate authorized a mercy mission to secure the banks and prevent Count Dooku from wresting control of the entire galactic economy. Skywalker was appointed as the general in charge of the Republic fleet, joined by Rex and their men from the 501st. One of their primary objectives was to rescue Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who had been on-world to recognize the inauguration of the Banking Clan's new leader, Rush Clovis, but had been trapped when the Separatists invaded and obliterated her Coruscant Guard security garrison. After their three-cruiser fleet reached the Scipio system, Rex, Skywalker, and their troops deployed from Skywalker's flagship in a squadron of LAAT/i gunships. En route to bypass the Separatist blockade, Rex used a datapad to review initial scans of the city that housed the Banking Clan's Main Vault and concluded that Amidala was there, still alive. Lieutenant Hawk and other pilots, flying clone Z-95 starfighters, provided escort for Rex and the others to blast through the enemy droid starfighters and enter Scipio's atmosphere. Dooku thereafter withdrew his Confederate flotilla from the planet, abandoning his remaining droid forces stationed at the Main Vault.\n\nUpon arrival at one of the Main Vault's landing platforms, Rex stormed out of the gunship with Skywalker and their men and opened fire on the squads of Separatist troops in the vicinity, including droid commandos, B2 super battle droids, and Vulture droids in walking mode. Rex and Skywalker soon found what remained of Amidala's felled security garrison, including the corpse of the officer in charge of the detachment, Clone Commander Thorn, buried under several super battle droids. In the ensuing lightfight, Rex and his men accepted the task of occupying the droid infantry on the landing platform and also provided covering fire for Skywalker, who pressed past the enemy forces and into the city to retrieve Amidala on his own. Skywalker reached Clovis's office and freed Amidala from Separatist custody there, but after a careening Vulture droid crashed into the spire atop of which the office was situated, Clovis sacrificed himself so that Skywalker could pull Amidala to safety. Following the Republic's triumphant seizure of Scipio, the remnants of the Banking Clan leadership blamed the late Clovis for the incident and conceded command of the banks to the Office of the Supreme Chancellor, transferring full economic power to Palpatine.\n\nWhen Master Yoda made a later visit to the Sith homeworld of Korriban, known at that time as Moraband, the Sith Lords Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus\u2014the latter being Dooku's alter ego\u2014engaged in an ancient ritual as a means of turning Yoda to the dark side. In the vision that Sidious and Tyranus concocted, Yoda found himself in a gunship with Rex, Skywalker, and a squad of four 501st troopers. The manifestation of Rex reported to Skywalker that they had detected a rogue shuttle slipping through Coruscant's security grid and that Dooku had been aboard the craft. Rex also revealed that, according to their scans of an industrial sector on Coruscant, Dooku was meeting with a second person inside of the LiMerge Building, to where their gunship was headed. Though at first disoriented, Yoda ordered the mission to proceed. Since Dooku was allegedly meeting with his Sith Master, Yoda believed it was imperative that they capture or else execute both Sith Lords. Upon touching down inside the building, Rex led the charge into the tower and sighted the two Sith Lords huddled over an altar basin, ordering his men to be wary of additional enemies. At Skywalker's word, Rex and his troopers opened fire on the Sith, but Tyranus reached out with tendrils of Force lightning to incapacitate Rex and his soldiers. Yoda's vision on Korriban ended after he sacrificed himself to defeat the hooded apparition of Sidious, with Sidious and Tyranus ultimately failing to break Yoda's spirit.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Effective commander[]\n\nA well-respected clone trooper captain, Rex viewed military service as an honor and acquitted himself as the leader of the 501st Legion. He projected an air of authority to his troops and earned their respect and obedience in that fashion. Leading by example, he saw the importance of being confident on the battlefield and motivating his men to fight for victory. To him, honor and service were the hallmarks of being a clone trooper. He trusted the men under his command and was a role model to them. He remained determined to achieve success in the face of danger, from frequently overwhelming enemy numbers to the life-threatening Blue Shadow Virus. Though he staked his life by the chain of command and did his best to honor superiors' orders, he also came to recognize the importance of a soldier's independence: He questioned orders instead of mindlessly obeying them and would adapt to shifting situations and plans as required.\n\nRex had several manners of etiquette as a commander that he strictly observed. He made a conscious effort to spend time getting to know all of his men on a personal level, and he consequently despised using the inconsiderate tally sensor to remember his charges' names because it was an admission that he could not tell his men apart from one another. He also valued his troops' privacy while not in combat. During the JanFathal operation, after the five rookie clones under his command opened up their own comlink channel, Rex avoided intruding on their conversation, even if they were cursing him for the recent loss of trooper Vere, and would have only overrode the frequency in an emergency. Outside of life-or-death situations, he abstained from barking out orders to his subordinates or superiors, believing that such conduct was improper.\n\nIn the absence of orders from superiors, Rex took matters into his own hands to ensure the survival of himself and his men. Despite generally being cautious and acting on certainty instead of hunches, he realized that in some situations there were no other options besides guesswork and improvisation. He was loyal to his men and genuinely cared for their well-being, for which he earned their admiration. All of Rex's traits in leadership were a testament to his effectiveness as a military leader, which was noticed by many of his colleagues, from troopers Checkers and Tup to Jedi General Pong Krell. Rex was well aware of his own talents as a leader and did his best to use them for the betterment of his men. His leadership skills were put to the ultimate test during the Battle of Umbara, where he was forced to balance the well-being of his troops with his commanding officer's strict orders. During that campaign, Rex found difficulty with uniting the 501st Legion under interim General Krell's leadership. Krell was focused on completing his mandates regardless of the cost, and he frequently employed strategies that the 501st perceived as reckless and costly. Though not afraid to speak out when he believed that he and his men were being treated inhumanely, Rex kept his men focused on their objectives and tried to set an example for his charges. He made an effort to respectfully cooperate with Krell despite the Jedi General's disagreeable behavior toward the clones.\n\nRex was tenacious in safeguarding his men's lives, even if that meant deviating from Krell's often reckless plans. At times he had more faith in his men than Krell did, trusting that Fives and Hardcase would be able to co-opt Umbaran starfighters from the nearby airbase\u2014unlike Krell, who threatened to relieve Rex of his rank should he stray from the original assault plan. Rex was receptive to his subordinates' concerns and welfare in ways that Krell was not, requesting a respite for the battalion after a twelve-hour overland march. Whereas Krell simply activated one of his lightsabers to silence dissenters, Rex listened to his soldiers' grievances even when he did not agree, such as during their preparations to seize the Umbaran airbase. As time went on, he grew more open to defying Krell's orders in order to preserve his men's lives. After Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase refused to abandon their plan to eliminate the orbital Separatist supply ship, even though Krell had outright rejected their proposal, Rex did not attempt to restrain the three soldiers from leaving, but he also made it clear that he would not be able to save them from Krell's wrath once they were caught. Nevertheless, Rex covered up the trio's departure from Krell and also prevented Dogma and Tup from reporting their insubordination to Krell.\n\nAs the dissenting trio's commanding officer, Rex displayed a measure of responsibility for his subordinates' exploits, even though the decision to disobey orders had been theirs and not his. When Fives and Jesse returned, Rex tried to take the full blame and punishment for their actions, claiming that he had ordered them to disregard Krell's decree, though Fives returned the gesture by honorably reporting the truth of their disobedience to Krell. In the end, Rex's concern for his troops' welfare outshone his adherence to Krell's authority: He openly disobeyed Krell's subsequent orders to execute Fives and Jesse. He knew that if such punishment was rendered even once, then all of the 501st Legion could eventually face a similar demise, and he refused to let his men be subjected to fear of execution. He was horrified when Krell manipulated the 501st into attacking fellow clone troopers from the 212th Attack Battalion; the incident instilled in him the need for justice to prevent a recurrence of such an atrocity. He thus resolved to lead his men into the \"uncharted territory\" of arresting Krell for treason against the Republic. Given the mutinous nature of his proposal, Rex knew that he could not force his men into participating and gave them the option to opt out, though all of them except for Dogma supported his decision. For the entirety of the episode, Rex persevered in his commitment to his men, for whose safety he sought to detain Krell.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Other material[]\n\nRex appeared extensively throughout supplementary material for the television series, including the series' tie-in webcomics; the Slaves of the Republic story arc of the monthly comic series; the first three installments of the graphic novella series; the novels written by authors Karen Traviss and Karen Miller; and a number of young-reader books. He was also featured in the video games Jedi Alliance and Republic Heroes and was given a role in the non-canonical video game LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars.\n\nRex was featured in the Clone Wars and Clone Wars Tactics expansions of the Topps Company's Star Wars PocketModel Trading Card Game. From 2008 on, he was designed as an action figure for several sets of Hasbro's The Clone Wars toy line, and he was also made into a LEGO mini-figurine as part of various building sets. His minifigure was given a uniquely designed head piece, a distinction from other clone trooper figures. He was included in packs for the 2008 The Clone Wars and 2009 Galaxy at War expansion sets of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Miniatures series. August 2009 saw Gentle Giant Studios release a life-size monument of Rex, standing six feet tall.\n\nIn 2010, Rex became the face of Star Wars merchandise packaging as part of the new \"Clone and Sky\" design. PILOT, the design firm that developed the artwork, was initially reluctant to use Rex because of its original intention to allow the viewer to look into the eyes of the featured character; Rex's helmet limited that emotional connection. To address that void, the background element of the \"ominous\" blue sky was added to imitate being on the front lines of the Clone Wars. The Rex \"Clone and Sky\" packaging lasted two years in Star Wars product marketing, with the Sith Lord Darth Maul replacing Rex as the featured face on Star Wars merchandise packaging in 2012. For 2011, Rex became immortalized as part of Sideshow Collectibles' Militaries of Star Wars deluxe figure line.\n\nRex appeared in the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures online video game, in which he was featured in several purchasable sets as well as in the game itself. He encouraged the player character to play the \"Galactic Forces\" mini-game\u2014previously for the \"Blaster Training\" mini-game before Clone Commander Stone replaced him in that role\u2014and to enter combat battle zones, such as Ryloth and the \"Battle of Umbara.\" He was also featured in the tutorial levels for the \"Card Assault\" mini-game.\n\nAuthor Jason Fry briefly referenced Rex's role in the 501st Legion in The Essential Guide to Warfare, a third-generation Essential Guide published in April 2012. Fry revealed in an interview that a story more prominently featuring Rex had to be cut from the final version of the book due to length constraints. Fry was later able to rework the omitted material as a short story, Speaking Silently, which was published in Star Wars Insider 139 in January 2013.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Infiltrating the Imperial Interdictor[]\n\nAn opportunity for Rex to resolve his differences with Kanan Jarrus arose after Ezra Bridger and Commander Jun Sato's CR90 corvette Liberator were captured by an Imperial Interdictor during a mission to the Del Zennis system. Prior to their capture, Sato had warned the other rebels that the Empire had a new warship capable of pulling ships out of hyperspace. Under the orders of Phoenix Leader Hera, Rex along with Kanan and Chopper were to infiltrate the Imperial warship and rescue Bridger and Sato. For this mission, Rex and Kanan were to disguise themselves as stormtroopers while Chopper was painted black to mimic an Imperial communications droid.\n\nWhen Kanan expressed unease about working with Rex, he reassured him that he knew which side he was on. After Zeb brought two captured sets of stormtrooper armor, Rex complained that the new armor was junk compared to the armor he had worn during the Clone Wars. For their mission, Rex, Kanan, and Chopper used a stolen Sentinel-class landing craft to travel to the Del Zennis system, which they learned had been classified by the Imperial authorities as a restricted testing area. While traveling through hyperspace, the two men argued about their mission. While Kanan wanted to find their people and get them out of Imperial custody, Rex insisted on disabling the new ship as well since it could pose a threat to the Rebellion.\n\nUpon approaching the Imperial Interdictor, Rex conned the Imperial scanners by telling them that his shuttle was having engine problems. Using emergency protocols he and Commander Cody had invented, they gained permission to dock in the Imperial Interdictor. After landing, Kanan used a Jedi mind trick to convince the stormtroopers guard in the hangar to let them through. Accessing a terminal, they learned through Chopper that Ezra was being transferred to a secure cell; meaning that the Empire had learned his identity. Disguised as stormtroopers, the three rebels made their way to Ezra's cell only to discover that the young Jedi had already broken free and locked his captors in his holding cell.\n\nMistaking Rex and Kanan for stormtroopers, Ezra stunned them with his lightsaber-blaster. When Rex and Kanan recovered, Ezra tried to save face by claiming that they had been involved in a big firefight. Chopper, however, played a holographic recording of what actually happened. While Kanan was furious, Rex laughed it off and suggested that Ezra should have set his blaster to kill in case it was not them. When Rex and Kanan broke into an argument about whether to limit their mission to rescuing their rebel comrades or destroying the ship as well, an irritated Ezra broke off and accompanied Chopper on a mission to sabotage the Imperial Interdictor's gravity well projectors.\n\nDisguised as stormtroopers, Rex and Kanan continued their mission to rescue their rebel comrades. When they stumbled on a stormtrooper patrol, Rex advised caution but Kanan decided to attack them. During the firefight, Rex complained that he could not see through his stormtrooper helmet and threw it at one of his opponents, knocking him out. After braving heavy fire, Rex and Kanan finally reached the detention cell holding Commander Sato and his crew. They decided to make their way back to Commander Sato's CR90 corvette Liberator. On the way, they were attacked by more stormtroopers. Rex decided to buy his rebel comrades more time by holding off their pursuers and locking the blast doors.\n\nRex took on the remaining stormtroopers in single-hand combat only to be stunned. Captured, Rex was brought before the Interdictor's commanding officer, Admiral Brom Titus. Recognizing Rex based on his code number, Titus tried to win Rex over by offering him immunity and reinstatement at an Imperial Academy if he would convince his compatriots to surrender. However, Rex rejected Titus' terms and the Admiral ordered an interrogator droid to torture him to death while two stormtroopers pinned him down over a round portal. Meanwhile, the other rebels reached Sato's corvette safely. After hearing Rex being tortured through the Force, Kanan decided to rescue Rex.",

        "content": "# Rex - Cartoon Network online games[]\n\nRex was featured in several online games on CartoonNetwork.com, all of which are no longer available. In Path of the Jedi, the player could choose to play as either Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, or Yoda. In the \"Assassin's Snare\" campaign, which adapted the first season episode \"Cloak of Darkness,\" Rex and his men are fighting a detachment of Separatist battle droids aboard a Republic cruiser when the clone troopers are cut off from their heavy weapons storage. If the player is playing as Tano, Skywalker sends her to retrieve the soldiers' electromagnetic pulse grenades from behind enemy lines. If the player chooses Yoda, then a clone trooper sends Yoda on the mission; if Skywalker is chosen, then Kenobi dispatches him on the assignment. After being rearmed with their supply of droid poppers, Rex and his troops make short work of the opposing battle droids. In the \"Shadow of Grievous\" campaign, which adapted the events of the episode \"Duel of the Droids,\" Rex and a squad of his troops are defending a Republic medical station from the Separatists but are gradually outnumbered by the enemy forces. Depending on the player's selected character, Skywalker, Tano, or Yoda cuts through the battle droids and rescues Rex and his men.\n\nIn Cartoon Network's Star Wars: The Clone Wars Game Creator, Rex was one of five characters whom players could use while designing their own online games. The game system allowed players to both create their own games and play those developed by others. Rex's \"Power Attack\" in the game was launching landmines. In the Galaxy of Heroes game, Rex was one of the playable characters in various shooting-style missions. Armed with only his blaster pistols, Rex must first defeat all opposing forces at a battle droid compound. He is then given an AT-TE walker to pilot and is tasked with destroying an enemy base, cutting through missile turrets, droid-manned STAPs, and laser emplacements to achieve his objective.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Order 66[]\n\nOn the way back to Coruscant to deliver Maul into custody, Rex and Ahsoka met at the bridge of the Star Destroyer and watched as it entered hyperspace. Noticing she seemed thoughtful, Rex asked if something was on her mind. Ahsoka was distraught that while the Jedi were meant to be keepers of the peace, yet the war had turned them into soldiers, including her. Rex agreed\u2014but reminded her that without the war, the clones would not exist. Ahsoka replied that perhaps the war had brought some good, such as the friendship between them. Both of them then saluted each other. Right then, an officer called Rex away to listen to the latest briefing. Rex tried to make Tano join him, but she denied the offer.\n\nAt that moment, via hologram, Darth Sidious ordered all clone troopers to execute Order 66 and gave Rex special orders to execute Tano despite her no longer being a Jedi, which Rex agreed to do.Ahsoka came into the room then, feeling through the Force that something terrible had happened to Anakin. Rex, trembling, dropped his helmet, and to the Togruta's confusion, two other clones present aimed their blasters at her, prompting Rex to order them to stand down, stating that he'll execute her. However, at that moment he remembered what Fives had been trying to tell him about the inhibitor chips and he was briefly able fight his programming, and telling her to \"find him,\" but inevitably succumbed and shot at Ahsoka. Ahsoka defended herself against Rex and the other present clones before escaping. Rex ordered the clones to hunt down Ahsoka, the captive Maul, and any who opposed the clones. Ahsoka had a plan, however, and she eventually stunned Rex into unconsciousness with the help of some astromech droids\u2014one of which was Tano's astromech that had served alongside her on many occasions in the duration of the Clone Wars.\n\nAfter sneaking herself and Rex's unconscious body into the Venator's medical bay, Ahsoka engineered a defense against the closed bay door with the droids and located Rex's inhibitor chip in his brain using the Force. Ahsoka ordered the droids to surgically remove the chip while she prepared for the imminent door breach. When the clones finally breached through the door, Ahsoka was nearly overwhelmed by the blaster fire. However, Rex's operation completed just in time for him to regain his true consciousness and shoot down a few threatening clones. Rex apologized to Ahsoka for nearly killing her, and As Ahsoka asked him, how widespread the inhibitor chips were, Rex crushingly admitted they were in every single clone; thus, the entire Grand Army of the Republic had turned against the Jedi Knights. Rex and Ahsoka fought their way through the Star Destroyer, stunning the brainwashed clones along the way. Maul, on the other hand, advanced towards the ship's hyperdrive core, where he killed all the clones stationed inside. Using the Force to tear it apart, Maul destroyed the hyperdrive mid-jump and crippled the Star Destroyer beyond repair, killing many troopers sent to engage the renegade Sith Lord. The damage caused the Venator to lose lateral controls and to plummet towards the surface of a moon, being ensnared within the moon's gravitational pull and quickly descending while tearing apart.\n\nRex and Ahsoka made their way to the hangar bay controls and opened the main hangar doors, where they found they were awaited by a large force of clone troopers led by the ARC trooper Jesse. Ahsoka told Rex to not kill the clones, prompting him to reply that the clones wouldn't care and wouldn't hesitate to execute them. After a pause, Ahsoka removed Rex's helmet revealing that the clone has begun to cry, devastated with the current dilemma. Ahsoka comforted the clone, while revealing her plan, which as to try to bargain that since she was no longer a Jedi, Order 66 did not apply to her. This plan failed however, with Jesse announcing that Rex shall be demoted and then executed along with Tano, causing Rex to quip that he never much cared for being a commander. With the help of the astromech droids, they avoided the clones and made their way towards a Nu-class shuttle until Maul, escaping from the doomed ship, commandeered the shuttle and used it to escape the Destroyer. Meanwhile, Rex, piloting a Republic Y-wing bomber, which he took from the maintenance bay, exited the doomed Star Destroyer and saved Tano, who was plummeting towards the moon's surface.\n\nCrashing onto the surface of the moon, the Star Destroyer was destroyed along with all personnel aboard the starship. Rex, salvaging parts of the Star Destroyer, prepared to depart the moon. He watched as Ahsoka dropped her lightsabers on the ground in front of the field of the clone trooper helmets belonging to the fallen, to make it look like they too had perished in the crash. Imperial reports would note that Rex had been killed in action.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Trouble at Concord Dawn[]\n\nRex was present during a meeting with Commander Sato and the crew of the Ghost to discuss the establishment of a new hyperspace route to the Lothal sector. With the Empire hunting them down throughout the Outer Rim, the rebels were in need of a new hyperspace route that would allow them to bypass Imperial forces. During the meeting, Sabine suggested that the rebels try penetrating the Concord Dawn system, which was home to a Mandalorian colony known as the Mandalorian Protectors. Rex advised his fellow rebels that the Mandalorians who inhabited the planet Concord Dawn had helped train clone troopers during the Clone Wars. At the end of the meeting, the rebels decided to send a diplomatic mission led by Hera, the leader of Phoenix Squadron, to negotiate for safe passage with the Protectors.\n\nHera's diplomatic mission failed since the Protectors led by Fenn Rau had aligned themselves with the Empire. Under Rau's orders, the Protectors' Gauntlet fighters engaged Hera's RZ-1 A-wing interceptors in a vicious dogfight above Concord Dawn. Several rebel A-wings were destroyed, and Hera was badly injured. Following the dogfight, Rex was present during a briefing where Sabine, one of the survivors, reported on the dogfight with Fenn Rau. Rex recalled that Rau had served as an instructor in the Grand Army of the Republic. With Commander Sato's permission, Kanan along with Chopper and Sabine took part in a mission to destroy the Protectors' starfighters on the third moon of Concord Dawn.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Effective commander[]\n\nA well-respected clone trooper captain, Rex viewed military service as an honor and acquitted himself as the leader of the 501st Legion. He projected an air of authority to his troops and earned their respect and obedience in that fashion. Leading by example, he saw the importance of being confident on the battlefield and motivating his men to fight for victory. To him, honor and service were the hallmarks of being a clone trooper. He trusted the men under his command and was a role model to them. He remained determined to achieve success in the face of danger, from frequently overwhelming enemy numbers to the life-threatening Blue Shadow Virus. Though he staked his life by the chain of command and did his best to honor superiors' orders, he also came to recognize the importance of a soldier's independence: He questioned orders instead of mindlessly obeying them and would adapt to shifting situations and plans as required.\n\nRex had several manners of etiquette as a commander that he strictly observed. He made a conscious effort to spend time getting to know all of his men on a personal level, and he consequently despised using the inconsiderate tally sensor to remember his charges' names because it was an admission that he could not tell his men apart from one another. He also valued his troops' privacy while not in combat. During the JanFathal operation, after the five rookie clones under his command opened up their own comlink channel, Rex avoided intruding on their conversation, even if they were cursing him for the recent loss of trooper Vere, and would have only overrode the frequency in an emergency. Outside of life-or-death situations, he abstained from barking out orders to his subordinates or superiors, believing that such conduct was improper.\n\nIn the absence of orders from superiors, Rex took matters into his own hands to ensure the survival of himself and his men. Despite generally being cautious and acting on certainty instead of hunches, he realized that in some situations there were no other options besides guesswork and improvisation. He was loyal to his men and genuinely cared for their well-being, for which he earned their admiration. All of Rex's traits in leadership were a testament to his effectiveness as a military leader, which was noticed by many of his colleagues, from troopers Checkers and Tup to Jedi General Pong Krell. Rex was well aware of his own talents as a leader and did his best to use them for the betterment of his men. His leadership skills were put to the ultimate test during the Battle of Umbara, where he was forced to balance the well-being of his troops with his commanding officer's strict orders. During that campaign, Rex found difficulty with uniting the 501st Legion under interim General Krell's leadership. Krell was focused on completing his mandates regardless of the cost, and he frequently employed strategies that the 501st perceived as reckless and costly. Though not afraid to speak out when he believed that he and his men were being treated inhumanely, Rex kept his men focused on their objectives and tried to set an example for his charges. He made an effort to respectfully cooperate with Krell despite the Jedi General's disagreeable behavior toward the clones.\n\nRex was tenacious in safeguarding his men's lives, even if that meant deviating from Krell's often reckless plans. At times he had more faith in his men than Krell did, trusting that Fives and Hardcase would be able to co-opt Umbaran starfighters from the nearby airbase\u2014unlike Krell, who threatened to relieve Rex of his rank should he stray from the original assault plan. Rex was receptive to his subordinates' concerns and welfare in ways that Krell was not, requesting a respite for the battalion after a twelve-hour overland march. Whereas Krell simply activated one of his lightsabers to silence dissenters, Rex listened to his soldiers' grievances even when he did not agree, such as during their preparations to seize the Umbaran airbase. As time went on, he grew more open to defying Krell's orders in order to preserve his men's lives. After Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase refused to abandon their plan to eliminate the orbital Separatist supply ship, even though Krell had outright rejected their proposal, Rex did not attempt to restrain the three soldiers from leaving, but he also made it clear that he would not be able to save them from Krell's wrath once they were caught. Nevertheless, Rex covered up the trio's departure from Krell and also prevented Dogma and Tup from reporting their insubordination to Krell.",

        "content": "# Rex - Skills and abilities[]\n\nRex's gifts in critical thinking and leading his brethren into battle reached the attention of the Kaminoan cloners, and he thus underwent command training and intensive programmed learning on Kamino. Further ARC training under Alpha sharpened him into a cunning and lethal soldier. As an expert in multiple forms of combat, Rex was skilled in armed and unarmed fighting. He was knowledgeable in the use of a jetpack, taking squads through the most difficult of flight paths. He was additionally well-versed in reconnaissance and military tactics and was capable of leading specialty clone trooper units in various operations when the need arose. His abilities were such that he came to be considered one of the best soldiers in the Grand Army. Rex valued being an accurate shot with a blaster and became proficient in marksmanship. He was able to hit both fast-moving targets\u2014such as a flying fuel cell on Skytop Station or a Single Trooper Aerial Platform on Lola Sayu\u2014and distanced marks alike, eliminating a gun emplacement on Geonosis from several hundred meters away.\n\nLike any good soldier, Rex knew his weapons and swore by his armor and gear, but he also recognized that equipment alone could not win a battle\u2014a soldier's greatest tool was his mind. Relying on intelligence over weaponry, he combined a commando's gift of improvisation with the toughness of an infantryman. Having been trained to resist interrogation as a prisoner of war, he was adept in mental resistance and was able to shield himself from a Force mind trick performed by the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress, due in part to his strong will and focus. He was relentless in using his abilities and equipment against his adversaries, whether they were Separatist droids on Ryloth or aggressive Talz warriors on Orto Plutonia, the latter of whom he faced with steely determination. He had a fast reaction time even when not in combat: He responded instantly with his blaster to the appearance of a Rishi eel on the Rishi moon, killing the predator with a single shot to the eye. He recognized the danger of hesitating in battle, even for a split second, and resolved to eliminate all of the enemies in his path before they could gain the upper hand. As Skywalker noted during the Battle of Christophsis, he did so without even having to think about his maneuvers.\n\nRex was able to hold his own against the larger units within the Separatist Droid Army, including octuptarra magna tri-droids and heavily armed Vulture droid starfighters. Though he dreaded the latter the most of all of the Separatists' combat droid models, he stood his ground against them. He was quite strong and was able to lift the injured Chairman Chi Cho without aid. He was also able to escape defeat at the hands of a menacing assassin probe aboard the Coronet by grabbing the attacking droid's pincers before they impaled him; he then managed to kick the large droid off himself. Against ruthless winds and menacing electro-mines on Lola Sayu, he was able to free-climb the cliff to an entry point to the Citadel. Despite having a temporarily paralyzed arm during the Battle of Saleucami, Rex was able to roll and fight in blaster combat against several droid commandos.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - The mystery of Tup and Fives[]\n\nWhen the Republic set its sights on seizing the planet Ringo Vinda, Rex helped Skywalker lead the 501st infantry that was assigned to the campaign. The Republic and Separatist forces clashed for control of the orbital space station that encircled the entire world, eventually becoming based out of opposite sections of the facility. Rex and his comrades became locked in combat with the Separatist battle group for at least five rotations, but it was not until the arrival of reinforcements under the command of twin Jedi Generals Tiplee and Tiplar that they began to make headway toward breaking the ongoing stalemate. As part of their renewed offensive, Rex and Skywalker led the 501st in pressing through one of the station's hallways, while Tiplee and Tiplar's men concentrated on repulsing the droid forces in an adjacent passage. Once they had reached a communications center, Rex and Skywalker regrouped with the twin Jedi Generals and claimed the facility for their own use. They next set their sights on a command center up ahead, out of which the Separatist commander, Admiral Trench, was operating.\n\nThe Jedi initiated phase two of their battle strategy: While Tiplee and Tiplar would each lead their men to Trench's command post via the outer two of three passageways, Rex and Skywalker would oversee a 501st advance through the middle corridor. Upon learning from Tiplee and Tiplar's clone officer, Commander Doom, that his men were severely depleted, Skywalker transferred Fives, Tup, and ten other soldiers from the 501st to Doom and Tiplar's squad. With that, Rex joined Skywalker in spearheading the 501st's push, blasting through a number of B1 battle droids in the central passage. The hallway eventually opened into a large room in front of Trench's post, and Rex and the others were faced with DSD1 dwarf spider droids and super battle droid rocket troopers. As they made progress toward Trench's position, Tup\u2014in a trance-like state\u2014executed Tiplar at point-blank range. Tup's shocking exploit, combined with the appearance of a squad of droidekas, crumbled the Republic's advance, and Skywalker ordered a full retreat, with Fives taking Tup into custody. Once Rex and the others had fallen back to the communications center, they welded shut the blast doors to cut off the pursuant battle droids, then turned to the perplexing matter of Tup.\n\nAlongside Fives, Kix, and Skywalker, Rex proceeded to interrogate the restrained Tup. Slipping back into his puzzling trance, Tup began to state that \"good soldiers follow orders\" before attacking Tiplee, who, undeterred, telekinetically repelled him with the Force. Skywalker decided to have Tup transferred to the medical bay of one of the Republic fleet's Star Destroyers before he tried to harm anyone else. Once Kix had completed a series of scans on Tup, the mystery deepened. After Rex, Skywalker, Fives, and Tiplee entered the ward, Tup\u2014who had been strapped to a bed\u2014questioned Fives about what had happened to him, evidently displaying no knowledge of his murder of Tiplar. Tup then began to panic, and a 2-1B medical droid promptly sedated him. At Skywalker's prompting, Kix reported that Tup had passed all of his scans, so Kix believed that Tup's behavior was the result of combat-related stress. Rex disagreed with Kix's diagnosis of an emotional breakdown, since all of them as clone troopers had been designed to withstand high amounts of stress, and Fives agreed. Rex and the others continued their conversation in the hallway outside, entertaining the possibility that the Separatists could have engineered Tup's breakdown by way of a virus\u2014as Tiplee put it, biological warfare. Still, Kix advised that Tup undergo extensive examination back on Kamino, the only place with facilities that were equipped for that level of surgical scrutiny.\n\nWith Skywalker's approval, Tup and his hovergurney were moved to the Star Destroyer's hangar. Rex, Fives, and Skywalker saw Tup off as he was ushered onto a waiting Nu-class attack shuttle for transport back to Kamino. Just as Tup's shuttle was about to leave the system with an escorting quartet of ARC-170 starfighters, Admiral Yularen and the bridge team aboard Skywalker's flagship lost contact with the craft. Rex joined Fives and Skywalker aboard an Eta-class shuttle to investigate the last known location of Tup's transport, and there they were met with a grim surprise: The shuttle's hull had been breached, with Rex theorizing that it was the work of Separatist buzz droids. Once they had outfitted themselves in breathmask survival gear, Rex and Fives joined Skywalker in entering the drifting Nu-class shuttle, finding nothing but carnage within, as the crew and embarked clone trooper detail had all been massacred. Amidst the floating bodies, Skywalker found Tup's hovergurney with its restraints severed. Fives believed that the Separatists' kidnapping of Tup indicated that they were responsible for his breakdown, and Skywalker did not rule out that possibility. Returning to their Eta-class shuttle, Rex and his comrades followed Tup's exceedingly faint tracking signal to the Separatist-held side of the space station, specifically the enemy's principal hangar. Skywalker decided that the shuttle would drop them off at the hangar, and he, Rex, and Fives would space-walk on their own from there.\n\nUpon reaching the Separatists' hangar, Rex and his comrades found it was occupied with hundreds of battle droids, some of which were loading Tup onto a Maxillipede shuttle. Rex voiced skepticism regarding their chances of surviving a direct confrontation with the droid army, earning Skywalker's comparison of his sentiment to that of the perpetually cautions Kenobi. As Tup's shuttle took off, Fives devised the idea of boarding the vessel via ascension cables, thereby avoiding the numerous droids in the hangar. Rex and Fives each attached a grappling extension to one of their blaster pistols and rappelled onto the shuttle as it passed overhead, with Rex bringing along Skywalker. After entering the airlock, Rex and the others broke into the main cabin and took down the BX-series droid commandos guarding the barely conscious Tup. While Skywalker defeated the shuttle's commander, the super tactical droid Kraken, Rex fought his way to the cockpit and gunned down the pair of OOM pilot battle droids at the controls. With Rex at the helm, they immediately piloted the captured shuttle to Skywalker's flagship, since Fives noted that the ailing Tup's life signs were dropping, indicating that he was close to death. Sending Tup to Kamino was paramount for him to be cured.\n\nOnce Rex and the others were back aboard Skywalker's flagship, a Consular-class cruiser designated as medical frigate 517 was prepared as Tup's transport. Skywalker assigned Rex to oversee the transfer, requiring a full report upon his return from Kamino. Prior to their departure, Fives asked for permission to accompany Rex to Kamino, as Tup was his best friend. Rex granted Fives' request but ordered him to proceed by the book so as to avoid further setbacks. Once they had arrived on rainy Kamino, Rex and Fives ushered Tup and his hovergurney into Tipoca City's Military Complex, where they were received by Shaak Ti and Doctor Nala Se, Chief Medical Scientist of Kamino and one of the principal engineers of the Grand Army's cloning program. While Se and a team of clone troopers took Tup to an observation room, Ti informed Fives that he would be undergoing a complete medical exam. She reasoned that if a virus was the cause of Tup's behavior, then Fives had likely been exposed to the same contagion. Although apprehensive about leaving his friend's side, Fives agreed to do so if it would help pinpoint a cure for Tup. After Ti informed him that Skywalker had ordered him back to the war zone, Rex told Fives to take care of himself as well as Tup before departing from Kamino.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Ringo Vinda, Rex and the 501st returned to Coruscant. In the intervening time, Tup died after a tumor was removed from his brain due to Fives' intervention. After disobeying orders and evading arrest on Kamino, Fives discovered that the tumor was actually an inhibitor chip\u2014an inorganic cerebral implant that the Kaminoans had inserted into all of the clone troopers at the embryonic stage. In Tup's case, his inhibitor chip had corroded and malfunctioned, leading to his unstable behavior. Upon arriving on Coruscant with Ti to plead his case to Chancellor Palpatine, Fives allegedly attempted to assassinate Palpatine and escaped into the lower levels of the ecumenopolis. Following Fives' getaway, the entirety of Coruscant's security and clone trooper forces were allocated to a manhunt for the rogue ARC trooper, but Jedi involvement was not requested. As a result, Skywalker volunteered to head the Order's undercover investigation into the matter, with Rex joining his Jedi General in the search for Fives. According to Ti, Fives believed that he was the victim of a conspiracy, Separatist or otherwise. Ti also warned Skywalker that since Fives had extracted his inhibitor chip\u2014as he had done for Tup\u2014his behavior might be as erratic as that of his late comrade.\n\nRex and Skywalker soon received a promising lead in the form of a communiqu\u00e9 from Kix, who had run into Fives at the clone sports bar known as 79's. Kix relayed a set of coordinates where Fives had requested a meeting with Rex and, by extension, Skywalker. Rex and Skywalker took a police gunship to the specified location, a portal warehouse on Level 1325. After disembarking, Rex and Skywalker warily entered the darkened warehouse, blaster pistols drawn and lightsaber ignited, respectively. Inside the building, they called out to Fives, who responded by thanking them for trusting him and then asked them to drop their weapons. Once Fives said he was unarmed, Rex and Skywalker complied, setting down their weaponry on a nearby crate. However, Fives, appearing disheveled and deranged, did not emerge from the shadows until he had trapped the pair in a ray shield. The beleaguered clone appealed to his irate comrades that he did not have a choice, saying he had been framed because he had uncovered a massive deception, the scope of which reached the highest echelons of the Republic. Fives claimed that the inhibitor chip in every clone trooper would even make them follow orders to kill the Jedi\u2014as Tup had done to Tiplar.\n\nRex and Skywalker did not know how to react to Fives' improbable claims, and their visible skepticism left Fives frustrated with their lack of belief in him. After Skywalker asked Fives to come with them, Rex assured Fives that they were listening to him and that their only intention was to provide help. Nevertheless, Fives refused, claiming that Palpatine would kill him. Fives implicated the Supreme Chancellor in the conspiracy, an allegation that Skywalker refuted without a second's hesitation. At that moment, Commander Fox and a contingent of Coruscant Guard shock troopers stormed into the warehouse, having pinpointed Fives' location via a probe droid. Although Fox ordered Fives to surrender, the rogue ARC trooper refused to do so and seized one of Rex's blaster pistols from the adjacent crate. Before Fives could fire his pilfered blaster, Fox shot first. Aghast, Rex and Skywalker watched from the inside of the ray shield as Fives collapsed to the floor, clutching at the lethal wound to his chest that Fox had inflicted. Once one of the shock troopers disabled the shield at Skywalker's behest, Rex rushed to Fives' side, shouting that he needed a medic, but it was too late. Fives told Rex that the conspiracy was larger than anyone could have imagined, and his dying words made mention to a mission and nightmares that, for him, were finally over. Rex was devastated by the loss of his longtime comrade. All of Fox's Coruscant Guard troopers took off their helmets in honor of the fallen soldier.\n\nIn the wake of Fives' death, Palpatine's personal medical staff concluded via autopsies that the source of Tup's and Fives' disturbing breakdowns had been a parasite native to Ringo Vinda, which had led to the deterioration of their inhibitor chips and, consequently, their volatile behavior. Unbeknownst to Rex and his comrades, the truth was just as Fives had said: Palpatine's explanation was a cover-up on the part of his alter ego, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, to mask an anti-Jedi directive that he and Count Dooku intended to execute via the clone troopers.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Inconsistencies[]\n\nIn June 2008, initial merchandising material for the television series indicated that Rex was an Advanced Recon Commando, but that rank was not repeated in subsequent material and is therefore assumed to be an error. Furthermore, Rex was listed as a clone commander in Star Wars Insider 103's The Clone Wars: A Who's Who Guide, the Jedi Alliance Prima Official Game Guide, the Wizards of the Coast sourcebook The Clone Wars Campaign Guide, Star Wars: The Clone Wars Activity Annual: Summer Edition 2009, The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 43, and the StarWars.com Encyclopedia entry for Saleucami, along with numerous issues of The Official Star Wars Fact File. Part 2 of the Fact File remake referred to Rex as a sergeant on one occasion, with the error being repeated in a revised issue. Yet in all other Star Wars material, Rex is portrayed as a clone captain, which this article reflects.\n\nDue to his rank as a captain, Rex's command over the 501st Legion lacks correlation with the Republic Grand Army's Order of Battle, as detailed in Star Wars Legends. Per The Essential Guide to Warfare, a clone captain is in command of a company, while a senior clone commander would command a legion like the 501st. Some source material correctly reflects the system: The 501st Legion's StarWars.com Databank entry stated that Rex led the core group of the 501st, while The Clone Wars novel series established him as the leader of Torrent Company, a 501st unit. Yet other publications\u2014including The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide and his StarWars.com Databank and Encyclopedia entries\u2014simplified his role to the overall leader of the 501st, subordinate only to Anakin Skywalker. To date, no official explanation has been provided to resolve the inconsistency.\n\nThere has also been a discrepancy regarding the extent of Rex's mental resistance abilities. The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide suggested that Rex was not able to resist the mind trick that Asajj Ventress performed on him during the Battle of Teth, but the novelization of The Clone Wars film maintained that he was indeed able to avoid succumbing to her mind influence. This article assumes that the latter's interpretation is correct.\n\nThe junior novelization of The Clone Wars film stated that Rex had the brown hair customary of clone troopers, which is inconsistent with the majority of other canonical material, in which his hair was depicted as bleached blond. In Slaves of the Republic - Chapter 6: Escape from Kadavo, Obi-Wan Kenobi addresses a clone trooper who is wearing Rex's customized blue-and-white armor as \"Cody.\" The Decoded re-airing of the first season episode \"Jedi Crash\" mistakenly referred to Commander Bly as Rex on one occasion. Also, the children's activity section of Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic 6.25 incorrectly identified the Advanced Recon Commando Havoc from the episode \"ARC Troopers\" as Rex. In addition to erroneously referring to Rex as a commander, Part 51 of The Official Star Wars Fact File mislabels an image of Clone Captain Keeli as Rex.\n\nIn a young-reader adaptation of the second season episode \"The Zillo Beast,\" written for Star Wars: The Clone Wars Activity Annual: Summer Edition 2010, Rex initially stays with Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu, and Dr. Sionver Boll at the Doge's Palace on Malastare to oversee the Battle of Malastare, instead of leading the clone troopers on the battlefield as he does in the episode. Also, during the adaptation of \"The Zillo Beast Strikes Back,\" Rex orders the LAAT/i gunships to fire their Malastarian fuel bombs at the Zillo Beast during the battle at the Republic Executive Building, whereas a clone trooper pilot delivers the order during the episode. In both cases, this article follows the episodes' interpretation of events.\n\nIn the 2011 third season episode \"The Citadel,\" while preparing to undergo carbon-freezing to bypass the Citadel's defenses, Rex and Skywalker both state that they have not yet undergone the process. That contradicts the events of the 2008 comic Shipyards of Doom, in which they utilize the process to infiltrate Gwori's droid-manned blockade. Dave Filoni and then\u2013Head Writer Henry Gilroy initially developed the carbon-freezing tactic during production on the television series' first season, though Gilroy instead incorporated it into Shipyards of Doom. Until official clarification rectifies the inconsistency, this article\u2014for the sake of preserving all canonical material\u2014assumes that Rex and Skywalker's dialogue in \"The Citadel\" is in error.",

        "content": "# Rex - Individualism and beliefs[]\n\nA seasoned soldier born to fight for the Republic, Rex was not often given to softness or sentimentality of any kind. He possessed an unusual individualism as a clone trooper, encouraged early on in his career during his participation in Alpha's ARC training program. Though Rex took on a unique nickname, he opted to keep its origins to himself. Unlike most clone troopers, he even kept the name's origins private from his Jedi commanders. According to Skywalker, he was wound very tight as a rookie soldier, eager to carry out orders to the letter, but became less stiff as time progressed. He made a habit of reviewing mission parameters and objectives in his head prior to an operation, a trait that he shared with much of his clone brethren, since it had been drilled into them thousands of times during training on Kamino. He did not allow himself to be intimidated by his enemies, from battle droids to Dark Jedi like Asajj Ventress, though he did\u2014at rare moments\u2014acknowledge being afraid. Although he recognized that fear was necessary to understand the severity of a situation, he refused to let such feelings prevent him from doing his job. He even expressed humor in the direst situations, such as during the Battles of Christophsis and Teth, as he believed that humor had many uses. In some ways, he could not imagine how the Republic had survived in antebellum times, without himself and his clone brethren in the Grand Army providing support and security.\n\nRex relied on instinct, sometimes preferring to shoot first without bothering to ask questions. Like many clone troopers, he regarded his homeworld of Kamino with a degree of personal importance. As such, he fought proudly alongside Commander Cody and their brethren to repel a Confederate invasion of Kamino, even rallying a group of young clone cadets to join the fight for their homeworld. Rex did not always look to a soldier's rank for information and instead judged by experience, which outranked everything in his system of beliefs, even the seniority of his superiors. When addressing the rookie soldiers of Rishi Station, he used the derogatory \"shinie\" slang to underline their inexperience in combat. He was pleased when the rookies rose to the challenge and acquitted themselves well in their first battle; he placed a handprint of Rishi eel blood on Echo's armor to recognize the trooper's transition to a seasoned warrior, and he also honored Hevy's ultimate sacrifice to destroy Rishi Station. He and Cody succeeded in sharpening the rookie clones into an effective fighting force. Rex inducted both Echo and Fives into the 501st Legion for their valiant service, and he later promoted them to Advanced Recon Commandos for their courage and determination during the defense of Kamino. Rex even saw a bit of himself in the two troopers.\n\nA disciplined captain, Rex was good at preserving a stoical front around his troops when facing setbacks. Even when deeply unsettled about the comm jammer situation at Kothlis, he was careful to maintain a focused outward attitude, to the point that Skywalker could only sense his unease through the Force. Although Rex was not easy to rattle, he was visibly startled when he overheard trooper Checkers complimenting his skills as an officer, and he snapped at Tano and Checkers to \"stow the chatter\" after that comment. As a commanding officer, Rex was efficient and thoughtful, and his decisions and conduct reflected his assiduity. He often stayed focused on the current situation by keeping himself busy, which he found easy to do on account of his countless day-to-day tasks as a soldier. He knew that over-preparation never hurt and kept his men ready for battle at all times. Opting for maximum situational awareness on the battlefield, Rex was not partial to the Republic's spacegoing navy. He preferred to have ground under his boots whenever possible, where he could use his natural senses to take in the environment around him, free of a starship's viewports. Even so, he learned to respect the willingness of civilian starship contractors to live or die by their workmanship's quality, since such workers often went space-side with assault craft in the war zone. He fell back on old-fashioned soldering whenever necessary, using hand signals to convey orders depending on the situation.\n\nRex learned what he could from the Republic's HoloNet News information bulletins, being used to absorbing information in that manner from his early Kaminoan flash training. He sometimes made judgments based on the contents of his training; for example, he respected diplomacy as a kind of fighting for which he lacked training. On the other hand, he saw fighting simply as a skill in which he was versed, not claiming to absolutely like it. Unlike some other officers in the Grand Army, he respected malformed clones like 99, whose strong spirit earned his admiration, and was greatly saddened when 99 died during the Battle of Kamino. Some of Rex's views were less open-minded, particularly as he encountered different cultures on his tour of duty. At times he did not pay much attention to history or culture; he initially could not understand the Lurmen of Maridun and their pacifistic choice to avoid fighting, attributing such behavior to a lack of pride. He also looked down on the Lorrdian militiamen during the battle for Ereesus, though he learned to trust and respect their aptitude for kinetic communication. When it was too late for the Lorrdians to return to their own base, he welcomed them to bunk with his own men. The experience additionally led him to form a close working relationship with one of the Lorrdian officers, Sollaw ap-Orwien. On Onderon, Rex embraced his leadership role in training the local rebels, treating them as he would the troops under his command. He did not hesitate to push them, impelling them to perform maneuvers like the soldiers they strove to become. When the time came to leave Onderon, Rex was impressed with the rebels' efforts.\n\nRex was tan-skinned and stood 1.83 meters tall, weighing eighty kilograms. He was versed in Galactic Basic Standard, the primary language of the Republic. Due to his naturally accelerated age, he was ten years old by the time of the Battle of Christophsis in 22 BBY, though his physical development was that of an older Human man. He paid considerable attention to his hairstyle, as he found hair under a helmet to be bothersome and annoying. As such, he regularly kept his naturally black hair shaved to a fine polish to prevent it from interfering with his concentration on the battlefield. Even so, he dyed his hair a light blond, his most obvious unique trait, and let it grow out to a certain extent on various occasions. He experimented with other hairstyles as well, briefly dying his hair blue after choosing to support the Bylluran Athletic bolo-ball team when it reached the finals. However, he eventually deemed his new hairstyle undignified and inappropriate for a commanding officer, and he shaved it off to better fit in with his black-haired troops. Rex had a small scar beneath his lower lip. He sometimes bared his allegedly perfect teeth in a feral smile when adrenalized for a coming engagement with the Separatists.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - The trouble with Krell[]\n\nBy the time of the Battle of Umbara, Rex had become used to Skywalker's more personal style of command. He thus came into conflict with the 501st Legion's interim Jedi General on Umbara, Pong Krell, a hard leader who strictly adhered to the chain of command. Rex initially respected Krell for his impressive military record, but he found that Krell was difficult to work with because of his apparent lack of regard for clone troopers\u2014Krell preferred to address them by their numerical designations instead of their individually chosen names, with which Rex took issue. Although he did his best to cooperate with Krell, he found that the Jedi Master rarely responded positively to suggestions as Skywalker did. Furthermore, he frequently viewed Krell's methods as flawed and reckless, since they often involved head-on assaults with high casualties. Even after Krell forced an uncooperative Fives to stand down by igniting his lightsaber, Rex firmly stood his ground against the Jedi General. He defended his troops' well-being and removed his helmet to speak to Krell face-to-face, asserting that the clones were men rather than faceless, rank-and-file soldiers. Though his tenacity and loyalty to his subordinates won Krell's respect, Rex still failed to see eye-to-eye with Krell as the Umbara campaign continued.\n\nOver time, Rex became more willing to disobey Krell's orders. During the battle to reach the Umbaran airbase, Rex developed a secondary plan to have Fives and Hardcase seize two starfighters from the enemy outpost to use against the Umbaran mobile heavy cannons. Though Krell did not approve of his strategy and even threatened to relieve him of duty for insubordination, Rex allowed Fives and Hardcase to carry out their stealth incursion. When Krell claimed that Rex had yet to understand that copious casualties were the price of victory, the captain's respect for Krell waned, and he agreed with Fives that it was Krell who would never understand the clones' sacrifices. After Fives, Hardcase, and Jesse slipped away on their illegal plan to target the Separatist supply ship in orbit of Umbara, Rex covered for them during their absence. He outright lied to Krell, providing a fake cover story that he had authorized the trio's use of the locked-down Umbaran starfighters and kept the Jedi General in the dark about the nature of their departure. Ultimately, he overtly defied Krell's orders to execute Jesse and Fives for their insubordination, and his respect for Krell eroded even further as he refused to be intimidated by the general's threats for retribution.\n\nRex began to question Krell's authority as well as his sanity, even suspecting that the Jedi Master had betrayed the Republic, and his suspicions were proven correct when the general turned the clone troopers against one another on the battlefield. He was appalled at Krell's crimes against his soldiers, especially since Krell was a Jedi Master. From that point onward, he resolved to treat Krell as a traitor, risking charges of mutiny to arrest the Jedi General for treason against the Republic. Rex deplored Krell's fall from the ideals of the Republic and his quest to become Count Dooku's new apprentice. With the imminent danger of the Umbaran militia advancing on the airfield, Rex reluctantly agreed with Fives, Jesse, and Tup that Krell needed to be executed before he could convey the Republic intelligence in his possession to the Confederacy. When about to shoot Krell, Rex remained undeterred by his taunts about being in a position of power. Yet for all the casualties that Krell had caused, Rex was unwilling to pull the trigger on an unarmed Jedi, and Dogma instead terminated Krell.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Tracking down the Bad Batch[]\n\nNotified by the sisters that Clone Force 99 was on Ord Mantell, Rex traveled there to find the Bad Batch, wearing a large cloak to disguise himself. He quickly discovered the Bad Batch at Cid's Parlor. After a quick reunion, including seeing Rex earn a big hug from Wrecker, meeting the group's newest member Omega, and reuniting once again with his old comrade Echo, Rex explained what he had been up to over drinks. However, the mood turned dark when Rex realized that the group had not had their inhibitor chips removed. Rex became very alarmed and reached for his blaster, but he was eventually talked down by Hunter. Rex warned them about the dangers of the inhibitor chips and convinced the group to meet with him on Bracca so they could be removed.\n\nOn Bracca, Rex led them to the inside of a Star Destroyer that was being scrapped. Avoiding Scrapper Guild patrols, they made their way inside and Tech began to scan the group to locate their chips and have them removed in a similar manner as to how Ahsoka had helped Rex remove his. However, as Tech prepped Wrecker to be the first to go, since he had been having recurring headaches due to his chip, Wrecker's chip activated and he grabbed Tech by the throat. Throwing his companion into a wall, he then set upon the others. Rex, Echo, and Hunter led him out of the room so Wrecker did not damage the equipment. They set a trap for him, with Rex springing out of a hallway to stun Wrecker, but he incidentally hit Echo when Wrecker tossed his fellow trooper at him. Rex was downed, but he eventually rose and pursued Wrecker, stunning the larger clone as he had cornered Omega.\n\nAfter Wrecker was subdued, the group performed the extraction. Rex and the others waited for Wrecker to wake up to see if they had been successful, and when they found Wrecker alive and well, they set to work removing the rest of the group's chips. Rex left to go outside and communicate to someone on his comlink. He was soon joined by Hunter, and Rex told the clone that his squad would be welcome to keep fighting for the Republic as he was. Hunter told Rex that the Republic was gone and that he needed to do what was best for his squad, and when Rex asked what that was, he nodded understandingly when Hunter replied that he was still unsure of what that was. Rex departed then, telling Hunter to say goodbye to the boys for him and contact him when they figured themselves out. As Rex began walking away, Hunter told him that if he was ever in trouble, that they would be there for him, and Rex gratefully nodded before departing.\n\nAlthough Hunter felt that the Bad Batch was on a different path compared to Rex, Echo believed the squad should have left with his old friend, knowing it would mean they would not need to work for Scaleback and that it would let them be soldiers.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Making peace with the past[]\n\nFacing a shortage of supplies, Rex, Kanan, Ezra, Chopper, and Zeb traveled to Agamar to obtain proton bombs from a wrecked Separatist supply ship that had crashed on the planet during the Clone Wars. After landing on Agamar, Rex took the opportunity to tell the other rebels about his Clone Wars experiences. When Ezra opined that the B1 battle droids did not look dangerous, Rex responded that these droids had killed many of his friends. Rex and the other rebels soon found the munitions depot and discovered that it was full of proton bombs. Before they could proceed further, they were trapped in a ray shield and stunned by several battle droids led by B1-268.\n\nAfter awakening, Rex and his fellow rebels found themselves prisoners of the super tactical droid Kalani. Kalani informed the rebels that he presumed the master control shutdown command issued to the Separatist Droid Army at the end of the war to be a Republic trick, and prevented it from disabling his battalion. Despite Rex insisting that the Clone Wars had ended and demanded that he and his friends be released. Kalani refused, stating that he would have one last battle; a victory for the Separatist Alliance. Zeb was the only one excluded from the battle on account that his species had not been involved in the Clone Wars. Though Rex, Kanan, and Zeb expressed their opposition to the war game, Ezra struck a bargain with Kalani. If the rebels made it back to the command center, Zeb would be free, and they would take all of the proton bombs in the hangar. Kalani accepted these terms, and the \"simulation\" began.\n\nUnknown to the rebels or the Separatists, Chopper had evaded the battle droids and sent a distress call through a Neimoidian escort shuttle. However, the Empire picked up the distress signal, and Governor Pryce gave the order for the nearest Imperial fleet to deploy forces on Agamar to wipe out the rebels. Back outside the supply ship, Rex, Kanan, and Ezra began the \"simulation\" as a large force of battle droids marched on their position. Utilizing a \"sword and shield\" maneuver whereby Rex would fire and the Jedi would deflect incoming shots, as well as using two thermal detonators to wipe out large sections of the droid attack wave, the trio made short work of the first group of battle droids. They reached the hangar bay only to find that Kalani had deployed three droidekas to intercept them.\n\nUnable to breach the droidekas' deflector shields, Rex and the rebels were forced to retreat. Rex and Kanan agreed to provide covering fire while Ezra headed into the hangar to collapse a catwalk over the droidekas. Ezra was delayed by an unexpected reunion with Chopper but still managed to collapse the catwalk with the Force. Meanwhile, Rex was hit in the chest by a blaster bolt from a battle droid but survived due to his clone trooper armor. While continuing their mission to the command bridge, they encountered Ezra. Rex chastised Ezra for his tardiness and warned him that one soldier's move affected everyone else in the team. In Rex's view, they needed discipline and strategy to succeed. Kanan counseled Ezra not to take the clone trooper's words personally because Rex was determined to finish the battle.\n\nAfter Rex knocked out another droideka with his helmet, the rebels managed to enter Kalani's command center and declared victory. However, Kalani disagreed on technical grounds and prepared to execute Rex. Before any further violence could break out, Ezra interceded and convinced the two sides to put aside their differences. After Imperial forces landed on Agamar and attacked B1-268 and a battle droid patrol, Ezra won over Kalani to their side by pointing out that the Empire was the successor to the tyranny of the Old Republic. Kalani accepted Ezra's logic and agreed to help the rebels formulate an escape plan.\n\nWorking together, Kalani, Rex, and the rebels improvised a strategy that involved rolling the proton torpedoes onto the feet of the advancing Imperial AT-AT and AT-DP walkers. When Kalani admitted never attempting such a desperate strategy, Rex responded that was why the clone troopers won; prompting Kalani to reply \"not always.\" After knocking out one of the AT-AT walkers, the rebels and droids fled aboard three Neimoidian escort shuttles while under fire from the Imperial walkers. One of the shuttles was shot down but the rebels' and Kalani's shuttles escaped into space.\n\nOnce in space, Rex and the rebels corresponded with Kalani by hologram. When Kalani opined that their joint effort was a successful strategy but not a victory, Rex opined that it was a victory and thanked Ezra for finding a middle ground that allowed the clones and droids to end the Clone Wars. Both Rex and Kalani also accepted Ezra's explanation that both sides could not win the Clone Wars. Despite departing on friendly terms, Kalani thought that the rebellion had a poor chance of success and parted for parts unknown. Rex and the other rebels were later contacted by Hera. Despite not obtaining the proton bombs, they acquired a new transport for the Ghost.\n\n",

Rex rode with Kenobi as his gunner on his BARC speeder. Rex finished off the last of the AATs with his rocket launcher as they approached the Separatist headquarters inside the governor's tower.\n\nFollowing the capture of Commander D'Nar, Rex went with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Ahsoka to Zygerria using the Tecora. Rex, disguised as a Zygerrian guard, went with Kenobi to find the colonists. Rex spotted Governor Roshti and attempted to escape with Kenobi and Roshti, but they were captured. Rex then went to a slave auction still posing as a guard. When Skywalker whipped Kenobi, Rex saw his signal and attacked the guards. However, he and the others were captured. Rex, Kenobi, and Roshti were taken to Kadavo, to its slave-processing facility.\n\nThere Rex worked in the facility's mines alongside Kenobi and the Togrutas as a slave. He and Kenobi were then brought before Keeper Agruss, who was ordered by Count Dooku to execute them. However, Rex and Kenobi freed themselves when Skywalker, Tano, and Plo Koon came to free the slaves. When Agruss tried to escape and taunted Kenobi for not being able to bring himself to kill a defenseless person, Rex threw Agruss' electrostaff at him, impaling the slaver and killing him. Rex and Kenobi then made their way to a gunship and left the facility before it was destroyed.\n\nFollowing the battle, Rex was assigned by Skywalker to guard the Supreme Chancellor against bounty hunter Moralo Eval's kidnapping plot.

        "content": "# Rex - LEGO Star Wars online material[]\n\nIn the LEGO Star Wars: The Clone Wars online comic series, Rex and a squad of clone troopers are assigned to undertake a mission, but battle droids shoot down their LAAT/i gunship on a desert planet. Just as Rex reports that the mission is proceeding as planned, several B1 battle droids and an OG-9 homing spider droid ambush them. After the spider droid knocks over Rex, he and his troops open fire on the droids. While the other troopers attack the droid menace, Rex finds a clone trooper from Batch 82-4 who is avoiding the battle due to his arachnophobia, a trait specific to his batch. The spider droid charges at Rex and the trooper, and the two take refuge in the remains of the gunship. Rex explains to the scared trooper that it is a droid, not an actual spider, and he watches as the soldier takes up arms and defeats the spider droid single-handed. As Rex congratulates his men on their victory, three more spider droids appear.\n\nRex joins Skywalker, Tano, Kenobi, and Rotta the Huttlet in a search for Asajj Ventress. Their team's AT-TE walker finds a squad of IG-100 MagnaGuards and their Rogue-class starfighter on a planet, but a B2 super battle droid and several IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks arrive and blast the walker off its feet. Emerging from their damaged vehicle, Rex, Tano, and Kenobi fight the new arrivals while Skywalker battles the MagnaGuards at the landing platform. Ventress appears with the Death Brick weapon and throws it at the three Jedi before escaping with the battle droids. Rex jumps into the line of fire and blocks the brick, which simply bounces off his head harmlessly. Commander Cody lands in the vicinity with an LAAT/i gunship and transports Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi away from the planet.\n\nRex is later sent with Kenobi, Cody, and a detachment of clone troopers to rescue Skywalker and Tano in a space battle, but a Separatist tractor beam pulls the group to the surface of a nearby planet. R2-D2 is able to open the door of Rex's gunship\u2014which has been jammed from the crash\u2014in time, and Rex arrives with Plo Koon to save Skywalker, Tano, Kenobi, Cody, and their squad of troops from Ventress and an army of battle droids. The Separatists are repelled, and Rex reports R2-D2's actions to Kenobi. Rex is present when Koon is given an award for his valiant efforts in the battle. Later, aboard Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's Venator-class Star Destroyer, Rex and Cody are present when Palpatine fires a clone scout squad in person for their incompetence and failure to find a missing R2-D2. Rex also accompanies Skywalker to Orto Plutonia when the Separatists stage an attack there. Traveling to the surface with Skywalker and several other clone soldiers in containers carrying Freeco bikes, Rex and his comrades defeat the droid infantry on the planet.",

        "content": "# Rex - A comrade turned fugitive[]\n\nWhile stationed aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, Rex joined Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody on the bridge to review an intercepted transmission from General Grievous. Due to a new encryption code that the Separatists had recently developed, the bridge team was unable to decipher the audio of Grievous's message. When Republic Intelligence encountered similar results, the Jedi High Council formed a squad of Republic droids to retrieve the Separatist encryption module responsible for encoding the transmission. Not only did the so-called D-Squad complete its mission, but it also thwarted a Separatist plot to sabotage the Republic strategy conference.\n\nWhen Republic Intelligence got wind of a new Subjugator-class heavy cruiser\u2014of the same class as the Malevolence, which had terrorized Republic systems earlier in the war\u2014that the Confederacy was constructing over a planet in the Enoth system, Rex was among the clone forces that went to target the nearly completed warship. He was present when Skywalker led a briefing for the assembled troops aboard his Star Destroyer. While Rex was to lead the ground unit that would destroy the heavy cruiser's energy shield generator, located on the planet below, Skywalker would lead the starfighters of Red Group and Blue Group in eliminating the battleship itself. After they reached the Enoth system, Rex led his battle group to the planet's surface with a pair of AT-TE walkers. As he reported to Skywalker, who was leading the space forces against the battleship's Vulture droid defenses, the clone infantry made progress toward the generator site, albeit slowly. Once they were within optimal firing range, Rex ordered the AT-TE walkers to open fire on the shield generator, to great effect. He then gave Skywalker the all-clear, and Skywalker's squadrons were able to obliterate the heavy cruiser\u2014mainly due to the sacrifice of clone Z-95 pilot Shooter.\n\nRex and the 501st were assigned to respond to a Separatist invasion of Cato Neimoidia, a former Neimoidian purse world and major holding of the Trade Federation. While Skywalker and Tano led a starfighter assault on the Confederate aerial defenses, Rex followed closely behind, overseeing the main body of troops from the gunship Lucky Lekku, which launched from the Republic fleet in orbit. Once his 501st landing force had reached Cato Neimoidia's bridge cities aboard its squadron of LAAT/i gunships, Rex received a request for retrieval from Skywalker, who had been stranded with Tano on an outcrop after Pistoeka sabotage droids, also known as buzz droids, destroyed his Eta-2 interceptor. Rex diverted the Lucky Lekku to the cliff to pick up Skywalker and Tano. The two Jedi were thereafter recalled to the Jedi Temple to investigate a terrorist bombing there, and they returned to Coruscant, as did Rex. Although Skywalker and Tano apprehended Letta Turmond, a Republic citizen who had engineered the bombing, Turmond was murdered while in Republic custody. Tano was framed for the crime, and as a result, newly promoted Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin, who was leading the Republic Military's investigation into the bombing, arrested and incarcerated her in the Republic military base.\n\nDespite an attempt on Skywalker's part to speak with his detained Padawan, the base's security staff\u2014headed by Clone Commander CC-1010 of the Coruscant Guard\u2014withheld Skywalker from seeing her as per Tarkin's orders. When Rex received word that Tano had escaped from her prison cell, he rushed to the military base with Skywalker aboard a Praxis Mk. I turbo speeder. Once there, he and Skywalker hurried after CC-1010, nicknamed \"Fox,\" who was pursuing Tano through the corridors of the compound. Upon discovering the bodies of three of his clone shock troopers, killed by lightsaber wounds and left in Tano's path, Fox concluded that Tano had slaughtered his men and ordered his search team of shock troopers to shoot to kill if they found her. Catching up with Fox, Skywalker promptly countermanded the order, while Rex argued with the commander, refusing to believe that Tano would have killed the troopers. Skywalker silenced Rex and Fox in mid-argument and called out to Tano, who was still inside the base. Tano claimed that she was being framed her for the murders, and though Skywalker assured her that he believed in her innocence, she was convinced that no one else would and refused to capitulate. Assuming command of the manhunt for his Padawan, Skywalker ordered Rex to relay an all-points bulletin to the base's security team. In light of the current evidence, Rex was forced to report that Tano had killed the three troopers and classified her as armed and dangerous.\n\nAs Rex and Skywalker joined Fox outside the base to oversee the external security patrols, Fox reported that they had spotted Tano heading for the industrial pipeline that led away from the complex. Skywalker ordered all of the shock troopers to set their blasters to stun mode, intending to take her alive. Rex, Skywalker, and Fox caught up on foot with the search teams just as they surrounded Tano near the pipeline's central viaduct. In spite of being outnumbered, Tano continued to evade capture, carving a hole into an adjacent pipe with her lightsaber and jumping into it. Rex followed his comrades in rappelling down into the pipe network in pursuit of Tano. With spotlights activated, he and Fox searched for the fugitive Padawan amidst the shadows of the sewers. During the hunt, they were separated from Skywalker, who found Tano first and tried to convince her to turn herself in. However, Tano was adamant against doing so and was determined to clear her name. Just as Rex and Fox found Master and Padawan at the edge of the water pipe, they were unable to prevent the latter from jumping out of the shaft. Rex and the others could do nothing but watch as she landed on a freighter far below, descending into the cavernous shipping portal of the Coruscant underworld.\n\nWith Tano now being framed for the murder of the clone officers at the military base in addition to the homicide of Letta Turmond, Tarkin concluded that Tano was further responsible for the bombing of the Jedi Temple, given that Turmond had admitted to collaborating with a dissident Jedi while Tano was interrogating her. The evidence even compelled the Jedi High Council to consider the possibility that Tano was guilty, resulting in Master Yoda dispatching two teams of Coruscant Guard shock troopers to detain Tano. Rex and Skywalker headed the first team, while Plo Koon and Commander Wolffe received command of the second. Both squads set out for the Coruscant underworld aboard a pair of Republic police gunships. As they crossed the ecumenopolis en route to the underworld's shipping portal, Rex interfaced with the local Coruscant Underworld Police, who oversaw security on the lower levels and claimed to have sighted Tano in the vicinity of Level 1312. Rex relayed the report to Skywalker, who ordered their search party's pilots to set course for that area as they descended into the underworld. Just as they neared the landing deck of Level 1313, Skywalker ordered the police gunships to train their spotlights on terminal 24, where Rex and the others spotted Tano in mid-conversation with an unexpected confederate: Asajj Ventress, who had ventured into bounty hunting and reformed her ways\u2014to a degree\u2014since being jilted by Count Dooku.\n\nSkywalker immediately jumped out of the police gunship and gave pursuit on foot, though Ventress cut him off by activating terminal 24's ray shield before bolting out of sight with Tano. In response, Skywalker sent out the search party's probe droids in search of the fugitive pair. The probes eventually located Tano and Ventress on Level 1312, where Wolffe and his team of Coruscant Guard troops attempted but failed to subdue the pair. In the meantime, Rex remained with his shock troopers aboard their police gunship and continued to monitor reports from the Underworld Police, hoping to come across another lead as to Tano and Ventress's whereabouts. When Rex heard word of suspicious activity on Level 1315, Skywalker had their police gunship adjust course for that area. After regrouping en route with Koon and Wolffe, Rex and Skywalker proceeded with their soldiers to the abandoned munitions warehouse where the police report had originated. Wolffe was the first one on the scene and\u2014upon sighting Tano\u2014stunned her at point-blank range before she could emit more than a few words. Upon further examination of the vicinity, Wolffe found that Tano had been inspecting several crates of nano-droids, identical to the ones that had been used in the bombing of the Jedi Temple.\n\nRex and his comrades took Tano into custody and withdrew from Level 1315, with Rex and Wolffe joining Skywalker, Koon, and the detained Tano aboard one of the police gunships while their shock troopers rode aboard the second gunship. During the flight to the Jedi Temple, Rex and Wolffe held the comatose Padawan upright while Skywalker and Koon holographically reported back to the High Council. Though Ventress's exact role in the situation remained a mystery, as she had not been present at the Level 1315 warehouse, Tano was still suspected of sedition on account of being found with the nano-droids. By all accounts, the case against Tano was gaining more momentum, since she had nothing but her word to defend her innocence. As a result, the Jedi Council expelled her from the Jedi Order so that she could be put to trial under a Republic military tribunal. Skywalker eventually discovered that Barriss Offee was the true culprit, having orchestrated the Jedi Temple bombing and then framed Tano for her own crimes. Although Offee was arrested and later confessed to her machinations, Tano ultimately decided not to rejoin the Order, resigning her Padawan status and her rank in the Grand Army to find a new path for herself.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Losing Ahsoka[]\n\nWhile Rex remained on Atollon as the overseer of Chopper Base's operations, he kept in contact with Ahsoka Tano as she traveled with Bridger, Jarrus, and Chopper to the planet Malachor to seek answers on how to defeat the Sith. Holding Tano in high regard, Rex offered to come to her aid within two rotations. Tano declined the offer and reiterated that this mission was Jedi business. When Tano joked that she outranked Rex, he replied that experience always outranked everything. Tano replied that she had more experience than him due to her experiences during the Clone Wars and Jedi Purge. Rex remained at Chopper Base for the duration of the Jedi mission to Malachor.\n\nIn Rex's absence, the Jedi and Tano came into conflict with the Inquisitors and forged a tenuous alliance with the former Sith apprentice Maul to obtain a Sith holocron which purportedly contained the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After destroying the Inquisitors, Maul turned on the Jedi and blinded Kanan with his lightsaber. Later, the Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived, and the Jedi and Chopper managed to flee but Ahsoka chose to stay behind.\n\nFollowing the mission, Rex and the other Spectres were present on the runway when the Phantom landed at Chopper Base. They watched in silence as Jarrus, now blind, and Bridger disembarked from the ship. When Rex saw that Tano was not with them, he bowed his head in sadness at the thought of having lost his good friend.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Heist at Reklam Station[]\n\nAfter Ezra and his team rescued the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka from the Imperial prison at Naraka, Rex attended a briefing where Hondo shared information on the Imperial floating junkyard Reklam Station inside the planet Yarma to the Phoenix rebels and Spectres. After Hondo revealed that the Imperials were dismantling Old Republic Y-wing starfighters there, Rex told his fellow rebels that the Y-wings were reliable combat fighters. In the end, the rebel leaders agreed to dispatch a recon mission to Reklam Station.\n\nRex accompanied Ezra's team and Hondo on the Phantom to Reklam Station. On the way, the rebels exited hyperspace at Sereeda Waypoint where they were intercepted by a Mining Guild patrol. After escaping the Mining Guild patrol, the rebel team continued their journey to Yarma. While traveling inside Yarma's gassy atmosphere, the Phantom was pursued by two Imperial DTS-series Dismantler Droids. While Chopper shot down one, Rex opened the Phantom's rear hatch and fought with the second dismantler droid. He almost fell out but was pulled back into the ship by Zeb. In the end, Rex managed to shoot the droid but the Phantom sustained damage. Fortunately for Rex and his team, Sabine regained control of the ship.\n\nAfter parking the Phantom beneath the station, Rex and his team convinced the local Ugnaught laborers to help them steal the Y-wings in return for their freedom. After stopping the conveyor belt, Rex and the other rebels began refueling the starfighters. Rex commented that refueling the fighters would not be their first nor last complication. After the Imperial Commander Brom Titus activated the magnetic locks on the Y-wings, Rex and Ezra departed to attack the Imperial control tower. Rex was forced to return when a third dismantler droid attacked Chopper, Sabine, and Zeb.\n\nRex used a magnetic crane to trap the dismantler droid against a metal container before pushing it down into Yarma's volatile depths. The dismantler droid erupted in flames. After Ezra cut off the station's power, Rex and the other rebels departed on the Y-wings. Chopper used the relay navigation system to remotely pilot the other craft. Rex then traveled in the same Y-wing as Chopper, and the rebels escaped into the space above Yarma. The rebel Y-wings were intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer commanded by Governor Arihnda Pryce. However, they were saved when the Phoenix fleet arrived with the fighter-carrier Phoenix Nest and evacuated the fleet. Due to the efforts of Rex and his team, the Phoenix rebels obtained five Y-wings which were then transferred to General Jan Dodonna's unit.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Skywalker's right-hand man[]\n\nWhen the Jedi High Council chose Ahsoka Tano to teach students at the Royal Academy of Government to help break the cycle of corruption on the planet, Rex accompanied Skywalker and Tano to the planet. While the two Jedi spoke with Duchess Satine and Prime Minister Almec, Rex and another clone trooper stood by their ship. After Skywalker took Tano's lightsaber, due to a recent law passed that no offworlders could bring weapons to Mandalore, Rex approached Skywalker, and Rex informed him that it was time for them to go. Skywalker departed the planet for a meeting with Jedi Master Kit Fisto, and Tano stayed on the planet to teach her class about corruption, and when on the planet she helped uncover a conspiracy led by Almec.\n\nIn an attempt to force Pantora to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, members of the Trade Federation loyal to the Separatists, such as administrator Sib Canay, arranged the blockade of Pantora. During the debate around the blockade, Rex stood with Skywalker as he spoke with Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who noted that the situation reminded her about the blockade Naboo had undergone. Suddenly, Tano ran up to the group, informing them that the daughters of Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida had been kidnapped. As Rex stood by silently, Skywalker told Tano that, due to Separatist involvement, she could technically perform a private investigation. Amidala asked if it was a good idea to go against the wishes of the Jedi Council, but Skywalker simply responded that they did it all the time.\n\nWhen the planet Balith fell into a large-scale civil war, the planet requested Republic assistance. Rex and Skywalker were assigned to help the Third Legion on the planet, but Tano was to stay behind on Coruscant to give a full report on recent events. As they were departing, Tano argued that she should go with the group, but Skywalker said that she had to finish her studies. Along with another 501st trooper, Rex and Skywalker then departed for Balith on a Nu-class transport.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Slaves of the Republic[]\n\nThe manner in which Skywalker and Tano rescue Rex, Kenobi, and the Togruta slaves on Kadavo differs greatly between the comic and the episode. In the comic, Skywalker and Tano arrive on Kadavo with a Republic strike force led by Commander Cody. The Separatists respond by deploying a fleet under the joint command of General Grievous and Asajj Ventress, the latter of whom leads a Vulture droid assault on the facility, as Dooku aims to hide his involvement in the slavery affair by eliminating the Togruta. Rex and Kenobi take advantage of the distracted Zygerrians by attacking them and joining Skywalker and Tano in rescuing the Togruta from falling into the lava pit below the compound. While Grievous recalls his assault fleet, the Jedi use the Force to pull the Togruta onto a freighter. When Ventress assaults the Jedi's freighter with her personal starship, the Trident, Rex fires a rocket at the craft, and the arrival of Plo Koon and a squadron of V-19 Torrent starfighters forces Ventress to retreat. Also, the keeper is not killed, simply taken into Republic custody. In the episode, no enemy forces save for the Zygerrians defend the facility against the Republic's rescue attempt. In place of Cody, Commander Wolffe and Admiral Coburn help Koon coordinate the rescue effort. Furthermore, instead of being involved with the rescue of the Togruta, Rex and Kenobi kill Keeper Agruss and defeat his guards before departing from the compound, while Tano, Wolffe, and Coburn save the colonists.\n\nThe aftermath of the rescue on Kadavo was also modified from the comic's version for the episode. In the comic, Rex and the others spend four more rotations evacuating the Togruta, after which they prepare to destroy the processing hub. As Rex is about to detonate charges placed in the facility, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine contacts them and orders that the facility be preserved for future Republic use. The Jedi disagree with the order, and Rex proceeds with eradicating the complex. Upon being returned to Kiros, the Togruta forsake their pacifistic ways to learn how to defend themselves, and Rex is among the clone troopers who educate them in blaster combat. In the episode's portrayal of the events, Koon's aerial forces demolish the Kadavo complex during the battle. Rex and the others debrief aboard Koon's Star Destroyer, but the episode does not include the Togrutas' return to Kiros.",

        "content": "# Rex - Individualism and beliefs[]\n\nA seasoned soldier born to fight for the Republic, Rex was not often given to softness or sentimentality of any kind. He possessed an unusual individualism as a clone trooper, encouraged early on in his career during his participation in Alpha's ARC training program. Though Rex took on a unique nickname, he opted to keep its origins to himself. Unlike most clone troopers, he even kept the name's origins private from his Jedi commanders. According to Skywalker, he was wound very tight as a rookie soldier, eager to carry out orders to the letter, but became less stiff as time progressed. He made a habit of reviewing mission parameters and objectives in his head prior to an operation, a trait that he shared with much of his clone brethren, since it had been drilled into them thousands of times during training on Kamino. He did not allow himself to be intimidated by his enemies, from battle droids to Dark Jedi like Asajj Ventress, though he did\u2014at rare moments\u2014acknowledge being afraid. Although he recognized that fear was necessary to understand the severity of a situation, he refused to let such feelings prevent him from doing his job. He even expressed humor in the direst situations, such as during the Battles of Christophsis and Teth, as he believed that humor had many uses. In some ways, he could not imagine how the Republic had survived in antebellum times, without himself and his clone brethren in the Grand Army providing support and security.\n\nRex relied on instinct, sometimes preferring to shoot first without bothering to ask questions. Like many clone troopers, he regarded his homeworld of Kamino with a degree of personal importance. As such, he fought proudly alongside Commander Cody and their brethren to repel a Confederate invasion of Kamino, even rallying a group of young clone cadets to join the fight for their homeworld. Rex did not always look to a soldier's rank for information and instead judged by experience, which outranked everything in his system of beliefs, even the seniority of his superiors. When addressing the rookie soldiers of Rishi Station, he used the derogatory \"shinie\" slang to underline their inexperience in combat. He was pleased when the rookies rose to the challenge and acquitted themselves well in their first battle; he placed a handprint of Rishi eel blood on Echo's armor to recognize the trooper's transition to a seasoned warrior, and he also honored Hevy's ultimate sacrifice to destroy Rishi Station. He and Cody succeeded in sharpening the rookie clones into an effective fighting force. Rex inducted both Echo and Fives into the 501st Legion for their valiant service, and he later promoted them to Advanced Recon Commandos for their courage and determination during the defense of Kamino. Rex even saw a bit of himself in the two troopers.\n\nA disciplined captain, Rex was good at preserving a stoical front around his troops when facing setbacks. Even when deeply unsettled about the comm jammer situation at Kothlis, he was careful to maintain a focused outward attitude, to the point that Skywalker could only sense his unease through the Force. Although Rex was not easy to rattle, he was visibly startled when he overheard trooper Checkers complimenting his skills as an officer, and he snapped at Tano and Checkers to \"stow the chatter\" after that comment. As a commanding officer, Rex was efficient and thoughtful, and his decisions and conduct reflected his assiduity. He often stayed focused on the current situation by keeping himself busy, which he found easy to do on account of his countless day-to-day tasks as a soldier. He knew that over-preparation never hurt and kept his men ready for battle at all times. Opting for maximum situational awareness on the battlefield, Rex was not partial to the Republic's spacegoing navy. He preferred to have ground under his boots whenever possible, where he could use his natural senses to take in the environment around him, free of a starship's viewports. Even so, he learned to respect the willingness of civilian starship contractors to live or die by their workmanship's quality, since such workers often went space-side with assault craft in the war zone. He fell back on old-fashioned soldering whenever necessary, using hand signals to convey orders depending on the situation.",

        "content": "# Rex - Making peace with the past[]\n\nFacing a shortage of supplies, Rex, Kanan, Ezra, Chopper, and Zeb traveled to Agamar to obtain proton bombs from a wrecked Separatist supply ship that had crashed on the planet during the Clone Wars. After landing on Agamar, Rex took the opportunity to tell the other rebels about his Clone Wars experiences. When Ezra opined that the B1 battle droids did not look dangerous, Rex responded that these droids had killed many of his friends. Rex and the other rebels soon found the munitions depot and discovered that it was full of proton bombs. Before they could proceed further, they were trapped in a ray shield and stunned by several battle droids led by B1-268.\n\nAfter awakening, Rex and his fellow rebels found themselves prisoners of the super tactical droid Kalani. Kalani informed the rebels that he presumed the master control shutdown command issued to the Separatist Droid Army at the end of the war to be a Republic trick, and prevented it from disabling his battalion. Despite Rex insisting that the Clone Wars had ended and demanded that he and his friends be released. Kalani refused, stating that he would have one last battle; a victory for the Separatist Alliance. Zeb was the only one excluded from the battle on account that his species had not been involved in the Clone Wars. Though Rex, Kanan, and Zeb expressed their opposition to the war game, Ezra struck a bargain with Kalani. If the rebels made it back to the command center, Zeb would be free, and they would take all of the proton bombs in the hangar. Kalani accepted these terms, and the \"simulation\" began.\n\nUnknown to the rebels or the Separatists, Chopper had evaded the battle droids and sent a distress call through a Neimoidian escort shuttle. However, the Empire picked up the distress signal, and Governor Pryce gave the order for the nearest Imperial fleet to deploy forces on Agamar to wipe out the rebels. Back outside the supply ship, Rex, Kanan, and Ezra began the \"simulation\" as a large force of battle droids marched on their position. Utilizing a \"sword and shield\" maneuver whereby Rex would fire and the Jedi would deflect incoming shots, as well as using two thermal detonators to wipe out large sections of the droid attack wave, the trio made short work of the first group of battle droids. They reached the hangar bay only to find that Kalani had deployed three droidekas to intercept them.\n\nUnable to breach the droidekas' deflector shields, Rex and the rebels were forced to retreat. Rex and Kanan agreed to provide covering fire while Ezra headed into the hangar to collapse a catwalk over the droidekas. Ezra was delayed by an unexpected reunion with Chopper but still managed to collapse the catwalk with the Force. Meanwhile, Rex was hit in the chest by a blaster bolt from a battle droid but survived due to his clone trooper armor. While continuing their mission to the command bridge, they encountered Ezra. Rex chastised Ezra for his tardiness and warned him that one soldier's move affected everyone else in the team. In Rex's view, they needed discipline and strategy to succeed. Kanan counseled Ezra not to take the clone trooper's words personally because Rex was determined to finish the battle.\n\nAfter Rex knocked out another droideka with his helmet, the rebels managed to enter Kalani's command center and declared victory. However, Kalani disagreed on technical grounds and prepared to execute Rex. Before any further violence could break out, Ezra interceded and convinced the two sides to put aside their differences. After Imperial forces landed on Agamar and attacked B1-268 and a battle droid patrol, Ezra won over Kalani to their side by pointing out that the Empire was the successor to the tyranny of the Old Republic. Kalani accepted Ezra's logic and agreed to help the rebels formulate an escape plan.\n\nWorking together, Kalani, Rex, and the rebels improvised a strategy that involved rolling the proton torpedoes onto the feet of the advancing Imperial AT-AT and AT-DP walkers. When Kalani admitted never attempting such a desperate strategy, Rex responded that was why the clone troopers won; prompting Kalani to reply \"not always.\" After knocking out one of the AT-AT walkers, the rebels and droids fled aboard three Neimoidian escort shuttles while under fire from the Imperial walkers. One of the shuttles was shot down but the rebels' and Kalani's shuttles escaped into space.",

        "content": "# Rex - A comrade turned fugitive[]\n\nWhile stationed aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, Rex joined Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody on the bridge to review an intercepted transmission from General Grievous. Due to a new encryption code that the Separatists had recently developed, the bridge team was unable to decipher the audio of Grievous's message. When Republic Intelligence encountered similar results, the Jedi High Council formed a squad of Republic droids to retrieve the Separatist encryption module responsible for encoding the transmission. Not only did the so-called D-Squad complete its mission, but it also thwarted a Separatist plot to sabotage the Republic strategy conference.\n\nWhen Republic Intelligence got wind of a new Subjugator-class heavy cruiser\u2014of the same class as the Malevolence, which had terrorized Republic systems earlier in the war\u2014that the Confederacy was constructing over a planet in the Enoth system, Rex was among the clone forces that went to target the nearly completed warship. He was present when Skywalker led a briefing for the assembled troops aboard his Star Destroyer. While Rex was to lead the ground unit that would destroy the heavy cruiser's energy shield generator, located on the planet below, Skywalker would lead the starfighters of Red Group and Blue Group in eliminating the battleship itself. After they reached the Enoth system, Rex led his battle group to the planet's surface with a pair of AT-TE walkers. As he reported to Skywalker, who was leading the space forces against the battleship's Vulture droid defenses, the clone infantry made progress toward the generator site, albeit slowly. Once they were within optimal firing range, Rex ordered the AT-TE walkers to open fire on the shield generator, to great effect. He then gave Skywalker the all-clear, and Skywalker's squadrons were able to obliterate the heavy cruiser\u2014mainly due to the sacrifice of clone Z-95 pilot Shooter.\n\nRex and the 501st were assigned to respond to a Separatist invasion of Cato Neimoidia, a former Neimoidian purse world and major holding of the Trade Federation. While Skywalker and Tano led a starfighter assault on the Confederate aerial defenses, Rex followed closely behind, overseeing the main body of troops from the gunship Lucky Lekku, which launched from the Republic fleet in orbit. Once his 501st landing force had reached Cato Neimoidia's bridge cities aboard its squadron of LAAT/i gunships, Rex received a request for retrieval from Skywalker, who had been stranded with Tano on an outcrop after Pistoeka sabotage droids, also known as buzz droids, destroyed his Eta-2 interceptor. Rex diverted the Lucky Lekku to the cliff to pick up Skywalker and Tano. The two Jedi were thereafter recalled to the Jedi Temple to investigate a terrorist bombing there, and they returned to Coruscant, as did Rex. Although Skywalker and Tano apprehended Letta Turmond, a Republic citizen who had engineered the bombing, Turmond was murdered while in Republic custody. Tano was framed for the crime, and as a result, newly promoted Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin, who was leading the Republic Military's investigation into the bombing, arrested and incarcerated her in the Republic military base.\n\nDespite an attempt on Skywalker's part to speak with his detained Padawan, the base's security staff\u2014headed by Clone Commander CC-1010 of the Coruscant Guard\u2014withheld Skywalker from seeing her as per Tarkin's orders. When Rex received word that Tano had escaped from her prison cell, he rushed to the military base with Skywalker aboard a Praxis Mk. I turbo speeder. Once there, he and Skywalker hurried after CC-1010, nicknamed \"Fox,\" who was pursuing Tano through the corridors of the compound. Upon discovering the bodies of three of his clone shock troopers, killed by lightsaber wounds and left in Tano's path, Fox concluded that Tano had slaughtered his men and ordered his search team of shock troopers to shoot to kill if they found her. Catching up with Fox, Skywalker promptly countermanded the order, while Rex argued with the commander, refusing to believe that Tano would have killed the troopers. Skywalker silenced Rex and Fox in mid-argument and called out to Tano, who was still inside the base. Tano claimed that she was being framed her for the murders, and though Skywalker assured her that he believed in her innocence, she was convinced that no one else would and refused to capitulate. Assuming command of the manhunt for his Padawan, Skywalker ordered Rex to relay an all-points bulletin to the base's security team. In light of the current evidence, Rex was forced to report that Tano had killed the three troopers and classified her as armed and dangerous.",

        "content": "# Rex - Friend to the Jedi[]\n\nRex was very close with his Jedi General Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, harboring deep respect and friendship for the man. The two trusted each other with their lives on a near-constant basis, and Skywalker even trusted Rex to know about his secret marriage and to act as lookout whenever he wished to talk to her via hologram. The two were close enough that friendly teasing was commonplace in their conversations. Rex trusted Skywalker despite some of his risky plans, noting that Skywalker always led from the front and appreciating his commitment to his troops.\n\nRex also developed a friendship and close bond with Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, even becoming a mentor to her by offering her advice and valuable leadership experience, teaching her that experience outranked everything. When Tano was framed for murder and treason, Rex doubted that she had committed the crimes, but followed the order to arrest her nonetheless. Despite this, the two would maintain a deep respect for each other after the Clone Wars. Rex and many of the other clones repainted their armor when Tano returned to their ranks shortly before the Siege of Mandalore. Although Tano told him that he did not have to refer to her as commander anymore since she had left the Jedi Order, Rex did so anyway.\n\nWhen Order 66 was issued, Rex managed to resist his programming long enough to warn Ahsoka, before succumbing to the order. Under the influence of order 66, Rex's goal was to kill Ahsoka. However, after Ahsoka had Rex's inhibitor chip removed, his loyalty to Ahsoka returned, and he was willing to kill own brothers to save her life. During the Imperial Era, Tano recalled her clone trooper friend when she saw the farmer Kaeden Larte, whose skin she noted to be darker than Rex's, albeit lighter than Mace Windu's. Later, she refused to imagine two stormtroopers as sharing Rex's face. Later during the Age of the Empire, Rex reunited with Tano by joining the rebellion. His knowledge of former Republic military bases, combat skills, and military tactics would help the rebellion in its fight against the Galactic Empire. He was devastated when he learned about her presumed death on Malachor.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Alliance to Restore the Republic[]\n\nFollowing the Spectres' mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple, Rex accompanied Syndulla and Kallus on a trip to the planet Seelos to recruit several old friends of Ezra to assist in the liberation of Lothal. As the Ghost entered Seelos' atmosphere, Rex contacted his fellow Clone veterans Gregor and Wolffe; who had settled in a former AT-AT walker known as Joopa Base that was roaming G872.\n\nAt Joopa Base, Rex and his rebel comrades encountered Gregor, Wolffe, the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka, his Ugnaught companion Melch, and the Mandalorian bounty hunter Ketsu Onyo. Rex, Hera, and Kallus recruited the group to participate in the liberation of Lothal as a favor to Ezra.\n\nWhile traveling back to Lothal, the rebels waited in space at Hondo's suggestion to catch a ride on an Imperial Class four container transport. As they waited, Rex doubted that Ezra and the others could hold out against Governor Pryce's forces. Shortly, the container transport arrived, and the rebels latched the Ghost onto the ship. Upon arriving at the Lothal cliff dwelling, Rex along with Gregor, Wolffe, and Kallus helped the other Spectres and Ryder's rebel forces defeat Pryce's remaining troops and capture the Imperial Governor.\n\nCaptain Rex participated in an operation to infiltrate the \"Dome\" alongside Wolffe, Gregor, and multiple other allies. The center of Imperial power on Lothal, the Dome was a mobile Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility that was equipped with thrusters. The rebels used two captured patrol transports to fly to the Dome. For the operation, Rex disguised himself as a stormtrooper. During the flight, Rex reassured a skeptical Gregor that Ezra's plan would work because he was a Jedi.\n\nWith the help of an unwilling Governor Pryce, the rebels landed at the Dome's executive landing pad. Following a brief battle, the rebels captured the command center. With the help of Ryder Azadi, the rebels issued a faux Protocol 13 which caused the Imperial garrison on Lothal to evacuate aboard the Dome. Before the rebels could launch the mobile base, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard the Chimaera and blocked their path. Since Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh and the Imperial forces had disabled the Dome's deflector shield generator, the Chimaera was able to bombard Capital City.\n\nEzra stopped the bombardment by offering to surrender himself. When Zeb proposed using the Dome's cannons to blast the Chimaera, Rex advised against it since their weaponry was no match for the Star Destroyer's firepower. Despite Rex and Hera's objections, Ezra escaped on a patrol transport and went up to face Thrawn aboard the Chimaera. In Ezra's absence, the rebels endorsed Sabine's plan to recapture the north and south power terminals in order to restart the Dome's shield generators.\n\nRex along with his fellow Team A members Hondo and Ketsu Onyo were assigned to the north power terminal. Despite fierce Imperial resistance, the rebels reached the north power terminal after Ketsu used a manual override to extend the bridges. Sabine also aided Rex's team by sealing a blast door so that they could proceed with their mission to reactive the power terminal. When Hondo's Ugnaught companion Melch arrived with a stormtrooper hot in pursuit, Rex shot the trooper. Rex was distraught when his Clone comrade Gregor was shot in the chest while taking part in the assault to secure the south tower. After restarting the north power terminal, Rex attended to his fallen comrade. Gregor told him it was a pleasure fighting alongside him for a greater cause before dying in his arms.\n\nAfter Ezra summoned a pod of purrgil to carry him, Thrawn, and the Chimaera into uncharted space, Rex and the other rebels watched in shock in the command center. The rebels then launched the Dome into Lothal's upper atmosphere. As stormtroopers tried to storm the command center, Rex and the other rebels evacuated aboard the Ghost, which was being flown by Rex's fellow clone trooper Wolffe, Mart Mattin, and Cikatro Vizago. Once safely airborne, the rebels detonated the Dome, wiping out the Imperial garrison on Lothal and ending Imperial rule on the planet.",

While on the moon, Rex encountered R2-D2, who was delighted to see his old comrade-in-arms as part of the team. Rex served in the Battle of Endor, fighting to ensure Emperor Palpatine could never hurt his clone brothers, or anyone else, ever again. Indeed, the battle proved to be a major victory for the Rebel Alliance; in addition to the destruction of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, Palpatine was killed by none other than Rex's former Jedi General, Anakin Skywalker, who redeemed himself back to the light side of the Force to save his son, Luke Skywalker.

        "content": "# Rex - Relationship with his fellow veterans[]\n\nWhile Rex initially had a difficult relationship with the Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus and argued over strategies and Ezra Bridger's priorities, the two put aside their differences following a mission to rescue Ezra and Commander Jun Sato from an Imperial Interdictor. Rex was staunchly loyal to the Old Republic and refused to recognize the authority of the Galactic Empire after his inhibitor chip was removed by Tano. Rex's fortitude led him to resist torture at the hands of the Imperial officer Brom Titus. He also regarded Imperial stormtrooper armor as inferior to the clone trooper armor he wore during the Clone Wars, just as he viewed the stormtroopers themselves as inferior to clone troopers. Especially compared to the other rebels, Rex was much more disciplined and by-the-book due to his military background.\n\nDue to his Clone Wars experiences, Rex harbored a significant antipathy for battle droids. However, he had a friendly relationship with Anakin Skywalker's astromech R2-D2 and a respectful relationship with the Lothal rebel cell's astromech droid Chopper. Additionally, he showed respect and even some compassion toward a turncoat B1 battle droid nicknamed Bats during the Clone Wars. His animus towards battle droids led him to reject Kalani's demand that Rex and his Jedi comrades Jarrus and Bridger take part in a reenactment of the Clone Wars. As a clone trooper, Rex was bred to fight and wanted to finish his mission to destroy his battle-droid opponents. However, Bridger convinced Rex and Kalani to put aside their past differences in order to fight the Empire.\n\nRex harbored considerable respect and loyalty to his former Clone Wars comrade Saw Gerrera, whom he had first met during the Onderon campaign. While Rex was unwilling to abandon his former comrade, he still expressed discomfort with some of Gerrera's harsh methods including brutalizing the Geonosian captive Klik-Klak and threatening to destroy the last Geonosian queen egg. Still, Rex was empathetic to Gerrera's pain and realized that his comrade was still grieving the loss of his sister Steela. Rex's belief in the sanctity of life led him to fight with Saw when the latter threatened to destroy the last Geonosian queen egg.\n\n",

Why else is there a bearded old guy on Endor, Tano? Why? It makes no sense. If you don't want that to happen, do you know what that means? I'm gonna make that happen, I'm getting like Palpatine, I'm getting power crazy.\" The Rebels series finale, which aired on March 5, 2018, confirmed that Rex did fight in the Battle of Endor, though it did not confirm whether he and Sant were the same character.\n\nSix months after the episode's airing, Filoni revealed in an interview with IGN he ultimately chose to not canonize the theory because he felt that laying down an already established character prior to his coming to Star Wars wasn't correct, adding that Rex could have been present at Endor and not be Sant, even though some fans could choose to believe that Rex and Sant are the same individual while other choose to not do so. In 2019, Rex was depicted in recreations of shots from Return of the Jedi, as well as original shots, in the Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures short \"Han Solo - From Smuggler to General.\" As Galaxy of Adventures is not meant to be a literal depiction of canon, no source has currently stated that they are the same character.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Head-to-Head[]\n\nAs part of the non-canon matchups presented in Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Head-to-Head, Rex is pitted against a deadly Separatist Infiltrator/Demolition droid, which disguises itself as a common sweeper droid to attack Coruscant's power generator complex. Bringing along a clone trooper security team, Rex is the first on the scene at the power generator and intercepts the demolition droid, which quickly expands into combat mode. He leaps behind some cover to evade the droid's arm-mounted laser cannons, returning fire with his twin blaster pistols. Ultimately, his precision in marksmanship saves the day: He prevents the demolition droid from arming itself as a bomb, dislodging its explosive charge from its housing. He then manages to disable the droid beyond repair with more blasterfire.\n\nThe storyline closely mirrors the events of the third season episode \"Heroes on Both Sides,\" in which a team of Separatist demolition droids execute a bombing of Coruscant's power generator. Whereas the droids are successful in the episode, the demolition droid fails its mission in Head-to-Head due to Rex's intervention.\n\n",

The Republic Defense Coalition of the High Republic Era also made use of the rank of captain, with such individuals able to captain their own RDC starship. In 22 BBY, the government created a proper army and navy. This new Republic Military, made up of clone troopers from the planet of Kamino, used the rank of captain in both its army and navy. Clone trooper officers who held the rank were known as Clone Captains, although non-clone officers could also serve as captains.\n\nMany clone navigation officers, some of whom held the rank of captain, wore a single-rowed plaque, with two red and one blue square (from left to right). In the army, Clone Captains led companies of 144 troopers and directly reported to a Clone Commander. However, as many of the Jedi Generals had a creative approach to the chain of command, some captains worked directly with to their Jedi officer. Clone Captain Captain Rex was a notable Clone Officer. Rex led the 501st Legion's Torrent Company and worked directly with Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, serving as the Jedi's first in command.\n\nClone Captains in standard Phase I armor were initially distinguished by maroon markings on their white armor, but many captains began to customize their armor to showcase their individuality, show their company's image, and keep from being easily identified by snipers.\n\n",

In addition to his trademark blaster pistols, the game's mechanics give him the use of a grapple gun and shock grenades, as well as the ability to command clone troopers during assault levels.\n\nThe game's story-based levels, which humorously adapt a number of first and second season episodes, are organized into three main campaigns, each of which focuses on Count Dooku, General Grievous, or Asajj Ventress. Rex is a playable character in the level for the first season episode \"Blue Shadow Virus,\" which is part of Ventress's campaign. In the Grievous storyline, Rex is incorporated into the levels adapting \"Duel of the Droids\" and \"Rookies,\" while he is also featured in the \"Weapons Factory\" level within the Dooku campaign. He is unlocked for \"Free Play\" mode following the completion of the first level in which he appears within each campaign's \"Story\" mode. In addition, he is one of the playable characters for the epilogue level of \"Story\" mode, \"The Zillo Beast.\"\n\nIn the game's \"Republic Assault\" mode, four levels feature Rex as one of the two Republic commanders whom the player can control: Saleucami and the Rishi moon, alongside another clone trooper; and the Ruusan moon and the third moon of Vassek, along with Commander Cody. In \"Separatist Assault,\" Rex acts as one of the enemy commanders in five levels: the third moon of Vassek, the Rishi moon, the Ruusan moon, Rugosa, and Christophsis.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Depiction and development[]\n\nRex was created for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film and television series, which ran from 2008 to 2013 on Cartoon Network, on Netflix in 2014, and on Disney+ in 2020. He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who reprised his role in the second, third and fourth seasons of the Disney XD television series Star Wars Rebels. Temuera Morrison would later play Rex in \"Part Five: Shadow Warrior,\" the fifth episode of Ahsoka. He has also appeared in several Star Wars Legends and non-canon media including the Dark Horse Comics Slaves of the Republic story arc and LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars.\n\nAccording to the The Clone Wars film DVD commentary, the series' creators originally intended to use the Legends clone trooper Alpha-17 of the Star Wars: Republic comic book series as the series' prime clone character. However, Star Wars creator George Lucas objected to Alpha's inclusion as it would have made too much alliteration (Anakin, Artoo, Ahsoka, and Alpha), leading to the conception of Rex. Later in the commentary, Dave Filoni stated Rex's use of twin blaster pistols was a direct reference to clone template Jango Fett. Filoni claimed Rex was more like Jango than some of his fellow troopers.\n\nBefore the cancellation of The Clone Wars series, Brent Friedman wrote scripts for a four-episode arc starring Rex and R2-D2. A heated rivalry between the Clone Army's general ground forces and pilots and their droids would ultimately result in Rex flying a starfighter with R2 as his copilot. They would crash and be stranded together on one of the moons of Ryloth, where most of the episodes would take place. Rex and R2 reprogrammed a B2 super battle droid that they would grow attached to, and at some point, Rex was injured.\n\n",

Hera placed Rex in charge of looking after the Ghost while the Spectres infiltrated Lothal aboard Cikatro Vizago's freighter Broken Horn.\n\nFollowing the Spectres' mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple, Rex accompanied Syndulla and Kallus on a trip to the planet Seelos to recruit several old friends of Ezra to assist in the liberation of Lothal. As the Ghost entered Seelos' atmosphere, Rex contacted his fellow Clone veterans Gregor and Wolffe; who had settled in a former AT-AT walker known as Joopa Base that was roaming G872.\n\nAt Joopa Base, Rex and his rebel comrades encountered Gregor, Wolffe, the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka, his Ugnaught companion Melch, and the Mandalorian bounty hunter Ketsu Onyo. Rex, Hera, and Kallus recruited the group to participate in the liberation of Lothal as a favor to Ezra.\n\nWhile traveling back to Lothal, the rebels waited in space at Hondo's suggestion to catch a ride on an Imperial Class four container transport. As they waited, Rex doubted that Ezra and the others could hold out against Governor Pryce's forces. Shortly, the container transport arrived, and the rebels latched the Ghost onto the ship. Upon arriving at the Lothal cliff dwelling, Rex along with Gregor, Wolffe, and Kallus helped the other Spectres and Ryder's rebel forces defeat Pryce's remaining troops and capture the Imperial Governor.\n\nCaptain Rex participated in an operation to infiltrate the \"Dome\" alongside Wolffe, Gregor, and multiple other allies. The center of Imperial power on Lothal, the Dome was a mobile Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility that was equipped with thrusters. The rebels used two captured patrol transports to fly to the Dome. For the operation, Rex disguised himself as a stormtrooper. During the flight, Rex reassured a skeptical Gregor that Ezra's plan would work because he was a Jedi.\n\nWith the help of an unwilling Governor Pryce, the rebels landed at the Dome's executive landing pad. Following a brief battle, the rebels captured the command center. With the help of Ryder Azadi, the rebels issued a faux Protocol 13 which caused the Imperial garrison on Lothal to evacuate aboard the Dome. Before the rebels could launch the mobile base, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard the Chimaera and blocked their path. Since Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh and the Imperial forces had disabled the Dome's deflector shield generator, the Chimaera was able to bombard Capital City.\n\nEzra stopped the bombardment by offering to surrender himself. When Zeb proposed using the Dome's cannons to blast the Chimaera, Rex advised against it since their weaponry was no match for the Star Destroyer's firepower. Despite Rex and Hera's objections, Ezra escaped on a patrol transport and went up to face Thrawn aboard the Chimaera. In Ezra's absence, the rebels endorsed Sabine's plan to recapture the north and south power terminals in order to restart the Dome's shield generators.\n\nRex along with his fellow Team A members Hondo and Ketsu Onyo were assigned to the north power terminal. Despite fierce Imperial resistance, the rebels reached the north power terminal after Ketsu used a manual override to extend the bridges. Sabine also aided Rex's team by sealing a blast door so that they could proceed with their mission to reactive the power terminal. When Hondo's Ugnaught companion Melch arrived with a stormtrooper hot in pursuit, Rex shot the trooper. Rex was distraught when his Clone comrade Gregor was shot in the chest while taking part in the assault to secure the south tower. After restarting the north power terminal, Rex attended to his fallen comrade. Gregor told him it was a pleasure fighting alongside him for a greater cause before dying in his arms.\n\nAfter Ezra summoned a pod of purrgil to carry him, Thrawn, and the Chimaera into uncharted space, Rex and the other rebels watched in shock in the command center. The rebels then launched the Dome into Lothal's upper atmosphere. As stormtroopers tried to storm the command center, Rex and the other rebels evacuated aboard the Ghost, which was being flown by Rex's fellow clone trooper Wolffe, Mart Mattin, and Cikatro Vizago. Once safely airborne, the rebels detonated the Dome, wiping out the Imperial garrison on Lothal and ending Imperial rule on the planet.\n\nGeneral Syndulla told Rex to bring out every star chart along Ezra's last known trajectory. However, they received a pre-recorded message by Ezra telling him that he made a difficult decision and thanking the Spectres for being his family. Rex warned that the Empire would return to the planet, an assessment shared by Kallus who hoped that the Rebel Alliance would finally send support. He and his allies decided to help defend Lothal but in addition to that, he continued to work with the Rebel Alliance with General Syndulla. Despite Rex's fears, the Empire never returned to Lothal.\n\n",

Due to his combat experience with battle droids, Rex was familiar with robolobotomy. While he was trained to wield firearms, Rex was also proficient in unarmed combat. Besides fighting droids and Imperials, Rex also had some experience dealing with the spider-like krykna which lived near Chopper Base, the Phoenix rebel base on Atollon. Rex also knew how to handle machinery, fly a Y-wing starfighter with ease, and resist mind tricks.\n\nRex put his combat and technical skills to good use when he escaped the Tribunal with Ahsoka Tano in a Y-wing bomber. Avoiding mediocre Imperial security on Raada, Tano understood that, if Rex were in charge of the operation, the security would be more effective; the stormtroopers were solely focused on patrolling the construction workers, while she knew Rex would have had his troops patrol through the streets, even if it made building more difficult. Comparing the lackluster security measures to Rex's standards convinced her the officers in charge were young. Lending the leadership skills he had developed in the clone army to the Rebel Alliance, Rex became a successful rebel. He also demonstrated his skills in a successful rebel operation to infiltrate and launch the Dome during the Liberation of Lothal.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Captain in the clone army[]\n\nA legend amongst his clone brothers, Rex was a dedicated veteran soldier and brave Clone Captain, later a Clone Commander. Rex was produced from the template of the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Rex even had adapted Jango's blaster-spinning routine with his pistols.  As with all of his fellow clone troopers, Rex lived to serve the Galactic Republic and to protect its citizens. While he was eager to follow orders, Rex adopted a less rigid approach as the Clone Wars wore on. Indeed, while he was someone with an absolute loyalty to the Republic and his Jedi leaders, even he would find himself plagued with doubt as the Clone War dragged on, taking more lives and ruining more planets.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rex would work alongside the Clone Commander Cody, the Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. He was also loyal to his men, feeling that protecting them was one of his primary duties as a leader. He tried not to dwell on any of the deaths of his countless friends and brothers, but when he had reason to believe that his comrade Echo was alive, he clung on to this belief.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rex's priorities were first and foremost to his clone brothers, whom he loved deeply. He was disgusted by Clone Sergeant Slick's betrayal of the Republic during the Battle of Christophsis, and was greatly anguished having to defend himself and shoot his own men during the execution of Order 66. Rex was particularly close to Commander Cody, as well as ARC troopers Fives and Echo. He greatly mourned the sacrifice of clone trooper Hevy; despite not having known the clone for very long, Hevy made a significant impression on the captain. Rex was also devastated by Fives's death and the apparent death of Echo, whom he was determined to rescue when it was discovered that he was alive. At some point, a photograph was taken of Cody, Fives, Echo, and Rex, which Rex treasured greatly. He was close with many other members of the 501st as well, including clone medic Kix, ARC trooper Jesse, and troopers Hardcase and Tup, among others.\n\nRex allowed the clone deserter Cut Lawquane to continue living his life away from the war. Rex and Lawquane's wife, Suu, were also friends. He was also close with Commando Gregor\u2014whom he considered an old friend\u2014and Commander Wolffe, living with the two of them for many years following the Clone Wars. However, despite his love for his brothers, when they were controlled by their inhibitor chips during Order 66, Rex was willing to kill them if it meant saving Ahsoka's life. It was not a decision Rex made lightly, with the Clone Officer crying at the thought that his brothers had been brainwashed to lay down their lives to kill him and Tano. Although in the end Ahsoka told him not to kill them, the clones were killed in the crash of the Tribunal, but Rex and Tano made sure to bury their bodies to honor their former friends.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Contradictions[]\n\nBefore the release of The Clone Wars season seven, many sources wrongly assumed Rex removed his control chip before the execution of Order 66 after Rex seemingly said as such in Rebels. Filoni later clarified that Rex only told Kanan Jarrus \"the point of view Kanan needs to understand who Rex is and what he's really about.\" Filoni noted that Rex probably filled Jarrus in on the full story offscreen.\n\nWhile season seven and subsequent stories have established Rex was quickly freed from his chip and then fought against the Empire, The Official Star Wars Fact File Part 118 erroneously claimed Rex served with the Empire for years, despite removing his chip, to stay with his brothers. According to the issue, Rex did not enjoy being a stormtrooper but underwent years of Imperial indoctrination, which made trusting Jarrus and Ahsoka Tano hard. Due to the lore laid out since this issue's release, this article assumes Fact File Part 118 is incorrect.\n\nRex was incorrectly identified as CC-7567 in Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!. The mistake was repeated in Rex's \"Databank Download\" article for Star Wars: Shatterpoint, with the title further misidentifying his number as CC-7667.\n\nRex's Rebels-era Kit Reveal for Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes stated he was not a core member of the Phoenix cell. While Rex was indeed not a member of the Spectres team, Rex was depicted as an important part of the larger Phoenix cell within Star Wars Rebels, even being depicted as someone who was able to join its command room. Indeed, even Rex's recruitment to the Phoenix cell grew out of the many skills and leadership he could offer the group. As such, this article assumes the Kit Reveal is incorrect.\n\n",

As part of the mission, Ezra, Chopper, and AP-5 stole a shuttle from the planet Lothal's Capital City spaceport and allowed themselves to be captured by Kallus' Imperial light cruiser, which was captained by Lieutenant Yogar Lyste. Disguised as stormtroopers, Rex and Kanan traveled in the Sentinel-class landing craft TY997 to Lyste's light cruiser to facilitate the extraction.\n\nThe rebel mission was complicated when Grand Admiral Thrawn requested an audience with Kallus and Lieutenant Lyste aboard his Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera. After reaching the Chimaera, Chopper informed Rex and Kanan about the change of plans. While Rex expressed shock, Kanan told Chopper to get them a fresh set of coordinates for the Chimaera since their current coordinates would only work on the Imperial light cruiser. Chopper complied and obtained the new set of coordinates with the help of Kallus and Ezra.\n\nAfter exiting hyperspace, Rex and Kanan discovered Thrawn's Seventh Fleet orbiting Lothal. When Kanan asked which ship, Rex told him to transmit the coordinates at random. TY997 was cleared for landing aboard the Chimaera. However, Thrawn had discovered that rebel infiltrators were aboard the shuttle and sent Governor Pryce to apprehend the intruders. Pryce saw through their stormtrooper disguises and ordered Rex and Kanan to surrender. When Kanan protested, Pryce stunned him.\n\nRex shot one of Pryce's stormtroopers before fighting hand to hand with the governor. Pryce overpowered Rex and knocked him to the ground. However, Lieutenant Lyste, mistaking Pryce for Fulcrum, stunned her. Before Lyste could attend to Rex, Kallus tackled him to the ground. Rex and his fellow rebels then fled aboard their landing craft. Kallus opted to stay behind in order to continue helping the rebellion. He also framed Lyste as Fulcrum in an effort to draw attention away from himself, but Thrawn was not fooled.\n\n",

        "content": "# Tatooine - Scum and villainy[]\n\nIn the last decades of the Galactic Republic, Tatooine was known as a haven for smugglers and criminal activity, including slavery. The sand people regularly attacked Fort Tusken, earning them their name of \"Tusken Raiders.\" It was home to a human slave named Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin.\n\nDuring this period, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo escaped the capture of her homeworld by the Trade Federation, and she took refuge on Tatooine with her companions and protectors, including the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Skywalkers befriended Amidala's party, and the young slave ended up participating in a podrace to help his new friends obtain a new T-14 hyperdrive generator for their damaged starship. After discovering that Anakin Skywalker would make an exceptional recruit for the Jedi Order, Master Qui-Gon Jinn managed to obtain his freedom from the junk dealer Watto in the city of Mos Espa, and the Queen's party left Tatooine with the boy. After participating in numerous adventures, including the Invasion of Naboo, the former Tatooinian slave joined the Jedi Order under Kenobi's tutelage.\n\nTen years later, Skywalker, now a gifted but unruly Jedi student, sensed that his mother, who had stayed on Tatooine and gotten married, was in terrible pain. Skywalker returned to the desert world in the company of Amidala, who was now a senator of the Republic and the young Jedi's secret lover. It transpired that Shmi Skywalker had been captured by Tusken Raiders and was detained in one of their camps. When Skywalker finally discovered his mother's location, he arrived too late, and she died in his arms from the consequences of the Tuskens' mistreatment of her. Enraged, the young Jedi slaughtered the entire Tusken tribe. This had serious consequences as the first step towards Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace. Shortly after the incident, the Clone Wars broke out, and the tortured Tatooinian Jedi became a major player of the pan-galactic conflict.\n\nFor the most part, Tatooine avoided the Clone Wars. Nevertheless, a Jedi-led mission to Jabba's Palace occurred, with the Jedi hoping to rescue Rotta the Huttlet from the Separatist Alliance. Later during the war, Chairman Papanoida and his son, Ion Papanoida headed to Tatooine to track down the bounty hunter Greedo, who had kidnapped members of their family.\n\nThree years after the start of the war, Skywalker fell to the dark side and joined the Sith, old adversaries of the Jedi who had long planned to take over the galaxy. The Galactic Empire, a new regime established to replace the Republic, started to hunt all Jedi. Skywalker's former master Obi-Wan Kenobi went into hiding on Tatooine, bringing the infant son of the fallen Jedi with him. On the desert expanses of Tatooine, Kenobi hoped that he could keep young Luke from his father's evil influence. Kenobi entrusted the boy to Shmi's stepson, Owen Lars, and his wife Beru.\n\n",

Throughout the battle, Bruck grew increasingly angrier, as did Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan eventually emerged victorious, tiring his opponent to the point of defeat. Yoda dispensed sage advice, but neither apprentice paid attention. After their Master left, Bruck taunted Obi-Wan into another, unauthorized, battle. Both boys fought until they were exhausted. Obi-Wan left the training area and returned to his room, but Bruck traveled up to the infirmary, muttered Obi-Wan's name, and pretended to pass out: his plan all along was to discredit Obi-Wan.\n\nLater that evening, as Obi-Wan bandaged his wounds, his clan Master, Docent Vant, arrived with shocking news: Vant's datapad detailed Obi-Wan's orders to report to the freighter Monument for transfer to the Agricultural Corps. Obi-Wan protested the decision, claiming that he could still become a Jedi Knight, but Docent was firm, and finally Obi-Wan conceded. He packed his bags, and after a tearful encounter with his Mon Calamari friend Bant, he went to bed in a state of despondency, in a world that now lacked meaning for him.\n\nThe next morning, Obi-Wan prepared to leave. The medics healed his burns, and he traveled down to the refrectory for one last meal at the Temple. During breakfast, he said goodbye to his friends Garen Muln and Reeft, as well as Bant. All three tried to reassure him, but he was unaffected by their consolation. It was the taunts of Bruck Chun and his friend Aalto that struck closer to home. Although Reeft broke the mood with some timely, food-related humor, it was clear that Obi-Wan felt that there was no hope remaining.\n\nHowever, on top of one of the Temple's tallest towers, in the Room of a Thousand Fountains, Yoda was arguing on his behalf. Although Mace Windu was originally skeptical, the testimony of Advanced Jedi Training Droid 6, a witness to the fight, swayed him. Yoda said that both Bruck and Obi-Wan would be allowed to spar for Qui-Gon Jinn that afternoon.\n\nLater that afternoon, Obi-Wan and Bruck sparred. Obi-Wan was fighting well, but because this was his last chance to be claimed as a Padawan, he suddenly attacked furiously, defeating Bruck. He went to Qui-Gon Jinn, sure that now that he had proven himself, Qui-Gon would accept him as a Padawan. However, Qui-Gon disapproved of his aggressive fighting style, and rejected him, saying that Obi-Wan would be at too great a risk for the dark side. Obi-Wan silently left the Temple, sadder than ever before.\n\nMeanwhile, Qui-Gon entered the Map Room, upset by the memory of Obi-Wan's expression. Yoda approached and confronted him, saying that if he did not take Obi-Wan as a Padawan, Obi-Wan's dreams would die. Qui-Gon prevaricated, saying that perhaps he would choose a Padawan next year. Yoda chided him for his reluctance, and reminded Qui-Gon that he too fought angrily as a boy. But Qui-Gon still refused to take Obi-Wan. Yoda warned him that if he did not choose an apprentice, he might end up with one anyway. Qui-Gon enquired as to Obi-Wan's assignment. Yoda replied that he was to work with the Agricultural Corps on Bandomeer, a statement that surprised Qui-Gon, who was just assigned a mission on the same planet. Yoda responded that Bandomeer is a good place for young Jedi to learn, and left Qui-Gon with the advice that he too still had more to learn.\n\nBoth Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan left for Bandomeer on the Monument, which also carried miners from the Offworld Mining Corporation and Arcona Mineral Harvest Corporation. Due to mutual animosity, the two companies kept to separate sides of the ship, but when Arcona Mineral Harvest's thermocons went missing, Obi-Wan and his Arcona friend Si Treemba went searching for them on Offworld's side of the ship. Si Treemba was caught by Grelb the Hutt, and Obi-Wan had to reveal himself to rescue him.

Protesters would gather in front of the Temple, blaming the Jedi for the military losses and the Jedi's loss of perspective as keepers of the peace. It was at that time that an explosion occurred at the Jedi Temple docking complex that killed six Jedi and several clone troopers and Temple employees. The investigation by crime scene analysis droid Russo-ISC and Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano found that Letta Turmond, the wife of Temple employee Jackar Bowmani, had fed him volatile nano-droids which then exploded, killing Bowmani and causing the bombing at the Temple. Turmond was arrested and held at the Republic Center for Military Operations.\n\nTano was subsequently framed for the death of Turmond, who was killed by way of the Force. She escaped to the lower levels of Coruscant, becoming a hunted fugitive while seeking to prove her innocence. After the military recaptured Tano, the former Jedi was put on trial for treason against the Galactic Republic. However, the charges against her were dropped when the rogue Jedi Barriss Offee confessed to the crimes that Tano had been accused of. Though she remained on Coruscant, Tano left the Jedi Temple after deciding to not rejoin the Jedi Order.",
