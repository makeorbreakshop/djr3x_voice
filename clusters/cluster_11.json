        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The King's blessing[]\n\nShortly, Saw and the rebel leadership returned to their safehouse and were informed by trooper Dono that former King Dendup was scheduled to be executed by King Rash the next day in the central Yolahn Square. Steela surmised that Rash intended to kill his predecessor simply as an example to the rebels; to humiliate the freedom fighters and their cause. Tano reasoned that if Dendup was executed he would become a martyr and bolster the rebel cause. For his part, however, Saw ignored both the words of the war advisor and his sister and took it upon himself to rescue King Dendup before Rash even had a chance to publicly declare Dendup a traitor. Steela ordered Saw to stand down, but Saw, believing that his life was worth the risk of preserving Dendup's, covertly set out nonetheless, unaware that Steela had tasked Dono to tail him.\n\nAfter donning a cloak, Saw jogged to the foot of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square and scaled the multistory temple utilizing a grappling hook. Once atop the temple roof, Saw quickly spotted King Dendup in the temple courtyard and beheaded a nearby sentry droid while making his way to him. Saw bowed before his lord, swearing fealty to the former king and introduced himself, explaining to the king the execution situation. In angst, Dendup chastised Saw for \"interfering with the affairs of the throne\" by forming the resistance and confessed to Saw his failure as Saw's king: by not choosing to ally Onderon with either the Republic or the Confederacy during the Separatist Crisis, a side had been chosen for him; and as a result of Dendup's choice not to choose, the Onderonian Civil War had broken out, and Onderonians like Saw had stepped up to rectify his errs. Nonplussed, Saw encouraged Dendup, surprising the king with news that the rebels had the support of the Jedi Order. Greatly encouraged, Dendup agreed to escape with Saw, but when Saw fired his grappling hook to escape the royal prison courtyard, he was frustrated to find that it was blocked by a one-way shield, which alerted the Unifar Temple to the intrusion. As klaxons wailed and spotlights targeted, Saw and Dendup were taken into custody by a sextet of droidekas.\n\nSaw was transferred to the royal central command of the palace, where at Kalani and King Rash's order, Saw was cuffed and hung in a containment field and placed under interrogation by Kalani. General Akenathen Tandin of the Royal Onderon Militia supervised the investigation. Kalani tortured Saw for throughout the night but Saw the patriot of Onderon refused to divulge to the droid general any of of the rebel secrets. As a result, Kalani grew increasingly embittered, so he hiked up the dose of electric torture and the longevity of the doses; hoping Saw would break down. His body smoking from the electricity, Saw held to his beliefs and will and suffered the torture until Kalani and his EV-series medical droid heightened the electric shocks to great enough wattage to easily kill Saw. Saw hung while the torture took its toll not only on his body, but on his mind and spirit; Saw hardened himself and had begun on his irreversible path to becoming a remorseless soldier. Tandin, feeling sympathetic to his fellow Onderonian, commanded Kalani and his droids to give Saw rest. Kalani reluctantly agreed.\n\nShortly, Saw was given a drink of tea by Tandin, who questioned why Saw had chosen to rebel against Rash's throne, believing that Onderon's past under the rule of Ramsis Dendup was outdated, and the future was Onderon under Confederate rule. Saw explained that he chose to rebel because King Rash misused the power of the kingship to empower himself, rather than the people. Saw boomed over Tandin's arguments, proclaiming that he fought in Dendup's name for the former king had chosen to politically fight for the people, therefore not choosing to side with either the Republic or the Confederacy for his own gain as Rash so quickly had. Saw's words of patriotism weighed heavily on Tandin.",

He and his sister, Steela Gerrera, were instrumental in the rebel liberation of their homeworld during the Onderonian Civil War. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire at the end of the war, Saw became a key member in the fight against the fascist government and the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. His tactics during the early rebellion against the Empire led him to be seen as an extremist, one whose notoriety was recognized by both the Empire, the Alliance, and, many years later, the New Republic.\n\nIn the early resistance against the Separatist Alliance on Onderon, Gerrera and his fellow soldiers were outnumbered and outgunned by the Separatist Droid Army. They requested help from the Jedi High Council, which led the Grand Army of Republic in its fight against the Separatists, but the Jedi Order chose not to become actively involved in the fighting on Onderon. Instead, they sent a team of advisors\u2014Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Commander Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain Rex\u2014to train the Onderonian fighters. The Jedi and Captain Rex taught them proper techniques and strategies for taking on the battle droid army, and, through their efforts, the rebels began to turn the tide. Gerrera came to resent that the rebels chose Steela as their leader, and he was soon captured in an ill-concocted solo effort to rescue the deposed King Ramsis Dendup from the Separatists. They were both rescued by the rebels, who eventually mounted a final battle against the Separatists. Through their efforts, the rebels liberated their world and returned Dendup to the throne. The fight, however, came at a personal cost: Steela was killed during the final battle, and Gerrera was left to mourn his sister\u2014feeling responsible for her death.\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire. Horrified, Gerrera and his fellow Onderonians resisted the Empire, and the Empire, despite the fact that Saw and his team had been instrumental in the liberation of Onderon, branded them as insurgents. Gerrera managed to evade Imperial capture, and he continued to fight against the Empire. During this time, Saw relocated Imperial scientist Galen Erso, his wife, Lyra, and their daughter, Jyn, to the uninhabited planet of Lah'mu. When Orson Krennic, an old friend of Galen's, discovered their location and took Galen away and killed Lyra, Saw traveled to Lah'mu, adopted Jyn, and raised her, all the while claiming that she was his own daughter.\n\nGerrera fought against the Imperial Military and led a resistance group known as the Partisans, a militant organization that some considered an extremist organization, using terrorist tactics and operating under the codename, \"Stoneface.\" His resistance cell, a continuation of his Onderonian resistance, was one of the first in the group of cells that formed the Rebel Alliance. He was later involved in the early campaigns of the Rebel Alliance, by which time his more-extreme tactics had come to stand in stark contrast with those of Alliance leaders Bail Organa and Mon Mothma. Gerrera eventually cut ties with Organa and Mothma, who viewed him as a militant and extremist.\n\nHaving learned that the Empire's massive kyber crystal had come from Jedha, Saw and the Partisans based their operation there. After the capture of an Imperial ensign, Bodhi Rook, who claimed that the Empire was building a planet-killer, Saw was reunited with Jyn, whom the Alliance had sent to meet with him. Since Rook had sent him a message from Jyn's father, Gerrera showed it to her, which revealed that the Empire was constructing a planet-killing superweapon called the Death Star. As the message played, however, the Death Star struck Jedha City and destroyed it. As the ripple of the explosion reached them, Gerrera told Jyn he was done running and stayed at the base, and was killed by the aftermath of the blast.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Early life and career[]\n\nSaw Gerrera was a human male who was born on the jungle planet Onderon during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Growing up within the walls of Onderon's capital city of Iziz as an Onderonian with his sister Steela Gerrera, Saw learned to greatly respect Onderon's monarch, longtime King Ramsis Dendup. In 24 BBY, thousands of star systems seceded from the Republic and formed their own galactic government, the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS). Within two years\u2014in 22 BBY\u2014the Republic and Confederacy broke into all-out war, the Clone Wars. King Dendup, wishing to keep his people out of the conflict, sided with neither the Republic and its newly-acquired Grand Army of clone troopers, nor the Confederacy.\n\nAfter the opening salvos of the Clone Wars were fired during the First Battle of Geonosis, the Clone War continued to sustain itself on battlefronts across the galaxy. At this time, at the behest of the Confederate Head of State Count Dooku of Serenno, the CIS instigated a coup that ousted Dendup from his royal throne and replaced with King Sanjay Rash, a \"puppet leader\" who answered directly to Count Dooku and cracked down on dissent. As ruler, Rash \"invited\" the Separatist Droid Army to Onderon\u2014but the act was actually an invasion of Saw's homeworld\u2014and subjected its citizens to Confederate law. Immediately after the planet joined the CIS, Saw\u2014who was deeply troubled for Onderon's future and undeterred that he and Steela had been banished from Iziz for openly defying King Rash\u2014and Steela began to gather resources and other like-minded individuals in the hopes of forming a resistance to fight against Rash and his battle droid forces.\n\nAt some stage, a young Gerrera found himself taken prisoner and forced into a rhydonium work camp in the hot Onderon jungles, where non-droid guards oversaw him and several hundred other young workers. The elder workers among them, meanwhile, had quickly died where they stood, leaving nothing but a few bones Gerrera and his fellow workers discovered the day after their deaths. Gerrera and his fellow younger workers found their clothing burning away and thus worked back and forth while naked. During one day, Gerrera, his fellow workers, and the guards all began to itch after a rhydonium leakage occurred, with the feeling seeping into their skin before the smell hit them. Gerrera found himself entranced by the new sensation and refused to run away, instead coming to love its smell and the itchy, burning feeling the substance gave. Whereas others would don a mask before working with rhydonium, Gerrera believed he understood the substance and thus did not require that gear.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Helping hand from the Jedi[]\n\nApproximately two standard years later, in 20 BBY, Saw had become the self-proclaimed de facto leader of the Onderon rebels, and as a result of being banished from Iziz, the rebels took up residence in an abandoned outpost within a group of ancient ruins in Sector S-29 of the wilderness. Around this time, Lux Bonteri, the son of the late Mina Bonteri, the former senator of Onderon in the Republic's Galactic Senate joined Saw and his resistance. Having obtained enough armor, blasters, and various other small arms to supply their forces, Saw, Steela, and Bonteri plotted to take back Iziz for Onderon; the rebel leaders, however, after a number of small skirmishes with battle droid forces, came to the realization that they were both under-equipped and had neither the training nor skills to wage open war against the Confederacy. Therefore, Saw and Bonteri reached out to the Republic, requesting aid even though Gerrera had no personal loyalty to the Republic government: in his mind, a pact with the Republic was simply a way to ensure Onderon secured its freedom.\n\nUltimately, the esteemed Jedi High Council on the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, heard Saw and Bonteri's story via HoloNet transmission. Grand Master Yoda promised that the Jedi Order would find a way to aid them. A short time later, the freedom fighters were alerted to an intrusion in the jungle Sector S-11 and Steela led a squad to investigate. Shortly, Steela, mounted on a dalgo steed, returned with Yoda's promise: Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Togruta Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and 501st Legion clone trooper Rex. Saw, mounted on his reptavian ruping, welcomed the four Republic Military advisors to his world. Skywalker informed Saw that they couldn't fight the Onderonian Civil War for the resistance\u2014Onderon, after all, was legitimately aligned with the Confederacy, no matter how illegitimate Saw viewed the situation\u2014but he would train Saw's resistance to fight well on their own. While Gerrera and his comrades had wanted the Republic to be directly involved in their struggle, they still appreciated the aid and believed it to be a good deal.\n\nRex explained that, as a clone trooper, he would assist the Jedi Generals. After relocating a half-kilometer to a clearing in the jungle where a captured Separatist Armored Assault Tank was left dormant, Jedi Commander Tano and Clone Captain Rex instructed the freedom fighters on how to disable the tank: they had drop a pair of Electro Magnetic Pulse grenades\u2014\"droid poppers\"\u2014into both the tank's cockpits, one for the pilot and one for the gunner. Saw and Bonteri teamed for the exercise, but sharing in a tense rivalry, incidentally sabotaged one another by refusing to cooperate. Disgusted, Saw ridiculed Bonteri for being a \"terrible soldier,\" which disappointed the Jedi advisors. As the day wore on, Saw grew increasingly frustrated, berating Steela for regularly attending to Bonteri, with whom she shared a mutual attraction. As the confrontation between Saw and Bonteri almost came to blows, Steela defused the two men, explaining that there would be both a time for the direct fight that Saw desired, and the political speeches that Bonteri excelled at.\n\nThe rebels next returned to the encampment, where General Skywalker and Rex demonstrated how to most efficiently disable droideka security droids. Protected by a deflector shield, droidekas were immune to blaster bolts. Skywalker, thus, indicated that a slowly rolled droid popper was the best way to disable the droids. Confident in his abilities, Saw stepped up and attempted the technique first; however, he rolled the grenade too quickly and failed to penetrate the shield. Bonteri tried next and succeeded. Later, after many tries and much coaching from Tano, Saw managed to roll the grenade at the right speed and pierce the shield.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Taking the fight to the Confederacy[]\n\nTrue to his training, Saw rolled his EMP grenade into the droideka's bubble shield and successfully disabled it, but Bonteri's grenade went too fast and alerted the other droideka to the danger behind. The droid turned and fired at its adversaries, but Saw acted quickly, shoving Bonteri to safety. Saw dove behind the disabled droideka, but was pinned down, so Steela leaped into action and deposited a droid popper gently into the droideka's shield bubble, disabling it. Just then, the desired Assault Tank rumbled onto the street and fired on the rebels. Saw and Bonteri rapidly closed the distance between them and the tank, taking down its B2-series super battle droid escorts on the way, and disabled the repulsorcraft using the duel droid popper strategy, just as they were trained. Saw then boarded the tank and attempted to get it running again, but to no avail. Steela, however, having a self-described \"woman's touch,\" and being the better pilot of the two of them, managed to start it up once more.\n\nSaw piloted the tank to the entrance to the generator compound and blew in the compound's two metal gateways. Steela sniped the droid guards while Saw waited for the tank's laser cannon to recharge. Bonteri and Steela fought off several BX-series droid commandos before Saw was able to target the generator itself, and when he fired on it, the ensuing explosion plunged the entire city into darkness. Saw donned night vision goggles in order to see, and was pleased to see that the freedom fighters were being cheered on by the Iziz citizens. Saw, Steela, Tano, and Bonteri returned to the safehouse and celebrated, raising drinks for Onderon. Skywalker, Kenobi, and Rex appeared via the HoloNet and a holoprojector and congratulated the resistance troopers. Kenobi added, however, that the time had come for the movement to elect an official leader. Confident that he would be elected by popular vote, Saw was disheartened when instead Steela was chosen by the Onderonian soldiers. Saw angrily stormed off.\n\nKing Rash and his Separatist forces had truly begun to feel the pressure from the rebel raids throughout Iziz, so Dooku granted them new droid legions of reinforcements headed by the super tactical droid General Kalani. The reinforcements were delivered in several Multi-Troop Transports on the orders of Count Dooku himself. Later, Saw hid incognito on a city street and helped Steela and more freedom fighters destroy a Confederate Army convoy that consisted of a Troop Transport, an Assault Tank, and numerous battle droids. Saw single-handedly wrecked the Assault Tank using his training; he blew up the hovertank agilely using two grenades. Steela then delivered a speech to the Onderonoians who had gathered amid the wreckage. She reminded them that Rash had committed treason against the Onderon people by selling out the world to the Separatist Alliance and requested that they join Saw and the rebels to reclaim the world and reinstate the rightful king, Ramsis Dendup.",

Steela, a sniper, impressed the Jedi with her skill. But while practicing, she was alerted to the fact that their encampment was under attack. Separatist B1-series battle droids and an Assault Tank pushed through the brush and opened fire on the rebels. Saw narrowly avoided being taken out by a missile blast from a B2-HA super battle droid, and advanced onto the frontline of the skirmish and returned fire. At a signal from the Jedi and Steela, Saw and other rebels heaved disruptor explosives into the path of the droids. Still outgunned, Steela loosed the dalgos, falumpasets, and tee-muss mammals, which stampeded and trampled the remaining droids. With only the armored tank remaining, Saw and Bonteri tried once more to disable the tank. On this attempt, however, the rebels worked together and succeeded in destroying the tank with a pair of thermal detonators. Elated in their first victory, Saw quipped that Bonteri looked more like a soldier than a politician, due to the grit that had come to cover him during the altercation. Knowing that their base location was compromised, the rebels and their advisors concocted a plan to infiltrate Iziz and pose as civilians in the hopes that they could wage the guerrilla war from within the capital.",

Holding Iziz under siege from within, Saw, Bonteri, and Steela received regular intelligence and guidance from not only Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, and Rex, but the Jedi Masters on Coruscant as well. Saw and the rebels took as many chances as they could to disrupt battle droid patrols and destroy droids harassing Iziz civilians, engaging in as many as five engagements in a single day\u2014sometimes, even in high-traffic areas, such as Malgan Market. Saw often opened fire on Separatist minions publicly, which caused fear to mount in the civilian population, despite the fact that civilian casualties sat at zero.\n\nOne day, Saw and his resistance held a meeting in their Iziz safehouse, where Skywalker congratulated them on waging a thus-far successful campaign. Kenobi and Tano, however, believed that the public perception of Saw's rebels had not gone as planned; the people were growing ever more fearful of the sudden violence that had besieged their city. Saw, however, believed that the people were fearful simply because the droids were still active\u2014that he hadn't done enough to demobilize the Confederates. Steela and Bonteri added that they had to assure the general populace that the freedom fighters were just that: fighting for the freedom of the people. Steela believed the rebels had to win the hearts and minds of the people to gain their trust, something Saw did not understand. In order to prove to the civilians that the rebels could oust the Separatists, Bonteri proposed that they strike the Onderon power generator. In agreement, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Rex returned to the Core Worlds, having outfitted the rebels as planned.\n\nThe Jedi Knights pledged that they would continue to provide credits to the Saw's movement and also stationed Tano to remain on Onderon. At dusk, Saw, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela scouted out the power generator complex. Lying prone on a rooftop, Bonteri explained that if they could manage to disable the power compound it would cause a city-wide power outage, which, given time, would bring the Droid Army to a literal standstill: the droids operated independently of a control computer, but still had to recharge periodically using power cells. However, before assaulting the generators, the rebels concluded that they needed to know more about the compound. Saw took it upon himself to gather the desired intel: he quickly descended the building and brutishly ripped the head off of a patrolling \"clanker\" in the street and returned to the rooftop where a robolobotomy was performed using a Republic-provided device. From the holographic images provided from the cranial unit, Saw and the rebels came to the conclusion that any attack on the compound would be futile; the droids were too numerous. Bonteri, however, saw an opportunity and added that if they had enough firepower it could be done with a hijacked Separatist Assault Tank .\n\nIn order to secure the tank, the resistance concocted a ruse: on a nearby street, the rebel Dono detonated an EMP-loaded airspeeder in the path of droid Patrol 118, beginning the attack. Saw, utilizing droid poppers and a DC-15A blaster carbine, took down the entire patrol, with the exception of the commander droid. The rebels let the commander call for reinforcements, hoping that the Separatists would deliver aid in the form of an Assault Tank. First, however, a pair of droidekas were sent in. Outmatched from the front, Saw and Bonteri navigated behind the droidekas in a flanking maneuver.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Recovering Vak-Nhalis[]\n\nLater that year, Gerrera, who had been fed rumors by prisoners of war about Separatist caches, orchestrated and participated in hijacking a starship belonging to Old Krezchak, a pirate raiding Confederacy installations across eight sectors. Krezchak refused to negotiate or surrender his cargo, leading to his death. Encountering the Separatist operative Soujen Vak-Nhalis, Gerrera ordered him to stop and, when the man attempted to flee, shot him with a modified DC-15A blaster carbine that overloaded his cybernetics. Gerrera asked if Vak-Nhalis felt its effects, which he affirmed.\n\nThe Onderonian questioned whether Vak-Nhalis, who had just awoken from a hibernation pod, knew about the Empire, ascertaining that the stranger was calculating how to kill him. Expediting the conversation, Gerrera revealed that he was aware of the saboteur's history and offered to let Vak-Nhalis accompany him or go down with the ship; Vak-Nhalis accepted the former. Explaining that Krezchak intended to auction Vak-Nhalis on Kafrene, Gerrera observed that Vak-Nhalis did not ask many questions, comparing him to a battle droid. Descending into the hatch connecting Krezchak's ship to his own, the Dalgo, Vak-Nhalis attacked Gerrera, aiming for the other man's back as to break his spine. The cyborg's ambush failed, and he was incapacitated by an ion mine clamped to the bulkhead. As Vak-Nhalis passed out, Gerrera provided his name, declaring that the Separatist belonged in his grave.\n\nGathered in a cavern, Gerrera conversed with two of his soldiers, Karama and Vorgorath. Karama criticized Gerrera, suggesting targeted strikes against guard posts and clone troopers; Gerrera dismissed clones as a tool of the enemy that could be replaced,  desiring instead to make fighting the war against the Empire a battle of attrition. Vorgorath disparaged Karama's constant questioning, but Gerrera, noting the pair's accomplishments, found the questions inoffensive, extending the sentiment to include answering Vak-Nhalis' inquiries if he proved useful.\n\nGerrera introduced Vak-Nhalis to Nankry, another guerrilla, but the assassin declined to test her skills. Vak-Nhalis took one of Gerrera's ration packs, causing the man to laugh, who in turn allowed the Separatist to eat. Gerrera asked whether Vak-Nhalis had heard of him, to which he did not reply, and spoke about Onderon's history with the Republic and the government's transition into the Empire, Gerrera comparing the self-appointed Emperor Palpatine to his own world's tyrant, King Rash. Vak-Nhalis accused Gerrera of looking for an excuse to fight, but the insurgent charged the Empire with tightening its grip on Onderon, murdering the Jedi, and instigating the conflict.\n\nNankry came at Vak-Nhalis while he ate, causing a short scuffle. The other guerrillas rose to their feet, though Gerrera stood back. The scrap, resulting in a stalemate, ended when Gerrera told his fighters to stand down, indicating to Vak-Nhalis that the attack, although lethal, had been a test. Vak-Nhalis threatened Gerrera with death if it happened again, which he agreed was fair before requesting that they speak privately. Alone, Gerrera explained the need for supplies to fight the Empire to Vak-Nhalis, recounting the rumors that led him to the pirate ship that he had salvaged the assassin from. Gerrera deduced that the operative was himself a Separatist contingency, which Vak-Nhalis did not deny, before inquiring how much of him was machine or man and if he had been conscripted.",

The Partisans discovered that one of the Empire's refineries was using wroshyr tree sap to make a powerful compound. Following that, they met Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis, who they asked for help in their attempts to free the Wookiees.\n\nIn return for Kestis' assistance in the attack on Kashyyyk, the Partisans agreed to search for Wookiee Chieftan Tarfful, who could aid Kestis in searching for a Jedi holocron with the names of several force-sensitive children. After the takeover of the refinery, Gerrera made a speech to encourage the flame of rebellion against the Empire and offered Kestis a place among the Partisans, saying that it would be nice to have a Jedi fighting at his side. Kestis felt honored by the offer, but he refused because he could not abandon his mission. Gerrera said the offer continued before it leaves. After finding Tarfful in the Shadowlands, the Partisans became overwhelmed by the Imperial forces, and the majority were forced to retreat before Kestis returned to Kashyyyk. Those who remained on Kashyyyk did so to Gerrera's disdain.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Reuniting with Jyn and death[]\n\nIn 1 BBY, just prior to the Battle of Scarif, the Partisans captured Bodhi Rook, a recently defected Imperial pilot. Bodhi carried a message from Galen Erso, who was trying to alert the Rebellion to the nearly-completed Death Star project. However, increasingly paranoid and believing that Imperial spies were everywhere, Gerrera was convinced that the defection was a trick by the Empire. To ascertain the truth, Gerrera used a mairan named Bor Gullet to read Rook's mind, at the risk of driving him insane. Afterward, he left the catatonic Rook in a cell, before deploying his men under Benthic and Edrio to attack an Imperial kyber convoy in Jedha City. In the ensuing firefight, Rebel intelligence Captain Cassian Andor, along with Jyn Erso, were captured: both were on the moon in search of Rook, whom the Rebel Alliance had learned had a message from Galen Erso.\n\nJyn and Cassian, along with \u00cemwe and Malbus, who had been caught up in the fighting, were brought to Saw's headquarters in the Catacombs of Cadera. Saw would see only Jyn. He questioned her on why she was there, demanding to know if she was there to kill him. She told him that she was there to ask for the message from her father and when it was given to the Rebel Alliance she would be on her way. Saw asked her why she did not believe in the dream of freedom throughout the galaxy. She told him about how he abandoned her at the age of sixteen and that his war did not mean anything to her. He then showed her the message from her father which revealed the weakness in the Empire's superweapon. However, as they spoke, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Orson Krennic had resolved to test-fire the Death Star's superlaser on Jedha, having traced Bodhi there and seeing an opportunity to wipe out Saw's insurgency. A low-power shot wiped out Jedha City in an instant and created a blast wave that spread for kilometers in every direction, threatening the Catacombs. Realizing the threat, Saw released his prisoners, commending Galen's message to Jyn and begging her to save the Rebellion. However, he declared that he would \"run no longer\" and remained in the Catacombs. After seeing Jyn's party escape, his last act was to tear off his breath mask before the blast wave consumed the Catacombs, killing him. His last thoughts were for his late sister, Steela, and his last word was her name.\n\n",

The smugglers were to deliver arms to resistance fighters in the Salient system, however, this smuggling ring was the brainchild of Orson Krennic. Krennic was using small uprisings as an excuse to take control of planets heavy in resources needed to build the Death Star. Obitt had revealed this information to his smuggler partners, and they decided to double-cross the Empire. When they arrived at Salient, it became clear that the Empire was expecting to arrest Obitt and the other mercenaries. Gerrera convinced Obitt to stay and fight the Empire. The people of the Salient system eventually lost the battle and Obitt was captured and later released by Wilhuff Tarkin; Gerrera, however, was able to escape.\n\nIn 17 BBY, Obitt came in contact with Lyra Erso. Erso wanted to have her husband, Galen, to quit working with Krennic, and the only way to do so was for the family to flee Coruscant. Obitt, who had known the Ersos since Jyn's birth, knew Krennic would expect him to help the Ersos, so he asked Gerrera to go in his stead. Gerrera smuggled Lyra, Galen, and Jyn Erso off Coruscant and helped them set up a homestead on Lah'mu. The Ersos stayed vigilant while living on Lah'mu, forming an escape plan in case Krennic found them. The plan was for Lyra and Jyn Erso to hide in a shelter dug under a cave and to contact Gerrera for extraction.\n\n",

At the highlands, Saw and the rebels constructed a new base, known as \"the nest;\" named for the rupings who used the highlands as a nesting ground. During this time, Padawan Tano and Bonteri enacted a quick mission back to Iziz where they utilized a holographic message of King-in-exile Dendup declared his allegiance to the Onderon rebels, whom he called patriots of true Onderon. Upon their return, Bonteri informed Saw that the civilians had taken to the Iziz streets to riot as a result of hearing Dendup's message. Encouraged, Saw voiced his desire to join the civilians and take the fight straight to Rash in the streets of Iziz, but Steela, Tano, Tandin, and King Dendup, all disagreed\u2014they believed the rebels needed to avoid civilian casualties at all costs, thus the Confederate forces had to be drawn out of the crowded city and into the wilderness of the highlands.\n\nIt wasn't long before Kalani located the rebels in the highlands and sent his army out to confront them. Meanwhile, the rebels and Royal bodyguards dug into the jungle mesas and prepared to repel the droid infantry. Once the battle of the Onderonian highlands began, Saw led a group of ruping riders, providing air support for the dalgo-mounted cavalry commanded by Tandin. The Confederate forces were caught off-guard by the rebels attack and were mostly destroyed by the rebels diverse forces of rupings, cavalry, snipers, and blaster cannons mounted on towering fambaas. Saw and his riders swept over the battlefront, destroying the droid's support vehicles with grenades. However, before the skirmish could be won, three HMP droid gunships entered the fray and systematically turned the tide of battle by killing much of Tandin's cavalry and fambaas. Saw's ruping riders were downed by two, and Saw was forced to hide from the droid fighters and recollect himself. Seizing the next opportunity, Saw bore his ruping towards a distracted gunship and lobbed a detonator at the hovering droid. However, the detonator did no damage to the craft as it was heavily ray shielded. The gunship next targeted Saw, and it managed to kill his ruping, throwing Saw to the ground. With the battle's tide having turned, Tandin's cavalry retreated, and the Royal General hoisted Saw atop his dalgo as the surviving rebel forces retreated back to the nest in complete disarray.\n\nAt the nest, the Gerreras, Tandin, Tano, and Bonteri convened to strategize. Tano explained that she had contacted her Jedi superiors Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and requested aid from the Jedi Council, but he wasn't sure he would be able to help the rebels. Refusing to be discouraged, Steela pointed out that since the droid could not be stopped before reaching the nest, the fort had to be fortified for the incoming invasion. Emboldened by her spirit, Saw expressed how proud he was of his sister. She accredited her skills as a leader to watching Saw. Saw returned to organize the defense at the battlefront a short distance from the nest, and shortly, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela arrived bearing new armaments provided by Skywalker and Kenobi through the Weequay Hondo Ohnaka, the pirate lord of the Ohnaka Gang: Sienar Fleet Systems RPS-6 rocket launchers. Saw immediately took one of the rocket launchers and fired a missile at a nearby gunship. The droid ship was brought down by the single shot; revitalizing the rebels' resolve to fight now that they had a weapon that could deal damage. The launchers were being distributed among the insurgents, when word came that the nest had been found and was under attack by the remaining gunships.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The perfect night[]\n\nBy 3 BBY, Gerrera's Partisans established a base of operations on D'Qar. That year, Rael put Wilmon Paak, an engineer belonging to Rael's Axis network, at Gerrera's disposal to manufacture a rhydonium mechanism. Paak presented the device to Gerrera who, admiring its loveliness, admitted it was a dream of his. Gerrera asked if it was \"healthy\" and had a full kit, which Paak confirmed, indicating its six gauges and eight variations.\n\nBecoming excited, Gerrera lauded the technology to his guerrillas as a galaxy of opportunities; rhydonium on demand\u2014what they wanted, when they wanted it. Gerrera asked Paak if the machine had been tested, to which he plainly stated that it worked. Demeanor shifting, Gerrera asked Paak who had taught him, leading Paak to question the inquiry in turn. Acknowledging rhydonium's high volatility and that few survived working with it, Gerrera reiterated his question. Paak replied that he was there to teach the variations and could not elaborate further.\n\nGerrera commended Paak's bravery, causing an eruption of laughter from the assembled Partisans, before asking if Paak had ever seen anyone die from rhydonium. Engaging in speculation, Gerrera wondered aloud if Paak, like himself, loved the smell of rhydonium; if inhaled too strongly, it would cause Paak's skin to blister as he combusted from the inside out. If Paak spilled it, cut a line, or dropped a wrench, Paak would ignite without a spark; immediate, explosive immolation.\n\nAsking Paak's name, Gerrera labeled him \"the Boy,\" inquiring if he had any actual experience. Paak admitted that he'd configured the device twice, though never alone. Observing that Paak was still alive, Gerrera summoned Pluti and instructed Paak to teach him the variations, starting with Paak's favorite. Paak alluded that it would be helpful to know what station the Partisans intended to hit, but Gerrera refused to disclose the information. Stressing that he needed to leave the next day, Paak was refuted by Gerrera, who altered the deal, promising to tell Rael that Paak was being cared for. Gerrera ordered that accommodations be made for Paak, who would stay as long as Gerrera had need of him.\n\nStudying under Paak, Pluti approached Gerrera with an understanding of the variations, though he desired more practice. Gerrera asked if they could lose Paak, who knew too much, confirming if Pluti was ready. Pluti defended Paak as a great engineer and asked what they would tell whoever sent him, but Gerrera dismissed Pluti, preferring to write Paak off as an accident. When Pluti expressed disappointment that Paak would not join them, Gerrera claimed he lacked confidence. Pluti, overwhelmed, pressed Gerrera for the information to focus on a single variations. Gerrera revealed that the attack would target the Station Four junction of Neen Valley's Markez Moon pipeline, occurring the next night. Specifying that Tubes had the pipe numbers, Gerrera opted to keep Paak around for a while longer.\n\nLater, Gerrera and Tubes approached Paak and Pluti. Gerrera asked Paak if Pluti could perform the operation independently, which Paak believed to be the case. Questioning his uncertainty, Gerrera raised a blaster to Paak's head, causing Paak to plead for his life. Gerrera instead executed Pluti, revealing him to be a traitor transmitting to the Empire. Having fed Pluti false information, Gerrera reassured the Partisans that they would not be caught in the ambush waiting for them on the Markez Moon, peacefully drinking rhydo parsecs away. Gerrera ordered the guerrillas to move quickly and burn what they did not take, as the Partisans would not be back to D'Qar.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Taking the fight to Jedha[]\n\nWith his campaigns against the Empire becoming increasingly brutal, Alliance High Command, at the urging of Mon Mothma, formally censured Gerrera and severed all official ties with the Partisans. By this time, Gerrera had lost his right leg and struggled to walk on a low-grade cybernetic replacement. Additionally, years spent huffing rhydonium fumes had scarred his lungs, confining him to a pressurized armor suit and requiring him to regularly take supplementary oxygen from a breath mask.\n\nHaving previously learned that the Empire's massive kyber crystal had come from Jedha, Gerrera relocated his militia to the moon, feeling that it was an appropriate place to bring his rebellion, as it was a sacred world to many different galactic religions. Due to the Imperials defiling many religious temples and artifacts in their pursuit of kyber crystals, small, local insurgent cells had begun forming in the Holy City of NiJedha in opposition to the occupation. From his new base of operations in the Catacombs of Cadera, just a half-day's walk outside the Holy City, Gerrera began recruiting and organizing the local insurgencies under the umbrella of his Partisans. During this time, he also held command over a pair of UT-60D U-wing troop transports and six T-65 X-wing fighters. Calling them the Cavern Angels, Gerrera began deploying this squadron in hit-and-run air raids against Imperial facilities in the Holy City, as well as the outlying, Imperial-controlled kyber mines.\n\nAmong the local insurgents Gerrera recruited were Guardians of the Whills Chirrut \u00cemwe and Baze Malbus, whom he enticed into joining by providing much needed provisions for the orphanage run by \u00cemwe and Malbus's friends, Kaya and Killi Gimm. Over several months, the Partisans attacked the Imperial occupiers, leading to harsher and harsher reprisals from the Empire. The Star Destroyer that had previously orbited high over Jedha descended to rest right above the Holy City, and the number of stormtroopers, tanks, and walkers on patrol in the streets increased significantly. \u00cemwe and Malbus came to Gerrera asking for assistance stealing a spacecraft so the Gimm sisters could flee the planet with their orphans. A group of Partisans, led by Beezer Fortuna, helped \u00cemwe and Malbus steal a Sentinel-class shuttle. Under the orders of Gerrera, Fortuna and the other Partisans attempted to double-cross \u00cemwe and Malbus, wishing to use the shuttle to blow up the Star Destroyer over the city. \u00cemwe and Malbus were able to talk the Partisans out of taking the shuttle, allowing the orphans to escape Jedha. However, this led to Gerrera parting ways with \u00cemwe and Malbus.\n\n",

This training afforded him skills in reconnaissance, infiltration, leadership, and knowledge in weaponry and military tactics able to contend with Separatist forces more effectively. Overtime, he also became knowledgeable in various droid model and their weaknesses. Like other Onderonian outcasts, Gerrera could also domesticate other animals such as a ruping.\n\nA battle hardened veteran during the Age of the Empire, Saw's greatest attribute was his intellect and leadership skills as a military tactician, which only improved and sharpened over time. He was an effective military commander who was adept in extracting information and launching hit-and-run raids on the Empire. Contrary to the rest of the rebels however, he was unrestrained by ethical concerns and as a result, willing to do just about anything to bring down his enemies, which caused friction with other Rebel factions. Gerrera was a feared insurgent, having had successful scores in the Arkanis sector while often leaving no survivors.\n\nIn combat, Gerrera was skilled in both armed and unarmed combat; In armed combat, he was well-versed in the usage of melee weaponry such as a staff, truncheons, and knives in addition to ranged weaponry like a blaster, snipers, and explosives. A capable hand-to-hand combatant, he was skilled enough to able to overpower both Ezra, Rex and incapacitate both stormtroopers and even death troopers.\n\nSaw later suffered severe injuries to his lungs and legs which forced him to wear a pressure suit for survival and to walk on prosthetic legs.\n\n",

A compassionate and charismatic man, Saw valued freedom, independence, and was a loyal follower of King Ramsis Dendup willing to fight for causes supporting them. The death of his sister, Steela, had a profound effect on Saw, sowing the seeds for the darker methods he would take up later in his lifetime.\n\nInitially, Gerrera did not understand the idea of fighting in a manner in which wins the support of people around them, a flaw in which left him dishearten for a time when his fellow rebels showcased his sister's methods as being more popular among them. Sometime after his sister's death, he'd garnered a more positive reputation, regarded as a effective soldier trained by General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex and a Onderonian planetary hero and was briefly considered a candidate for Govenor by the Galactic Empire. Although his methods were beginning to bordering extreme, Mothma noted upon meeting him for the first time, he moved with confidence akin to a chancellor or a judge and noted when accused of having no strategy by Organa, he revealed himself to be pragmatic, clever, and more concerned for public opinion than he let on, having grand plans, ambitions, and capable of working with criminal elements to achieve his goals although limited to a single-sector conflict. Fitting this image, he practiced giving speeches to inspire others to his cause.\n\nHowever, through a combinations of his own actions as well as both accounts of the Empire and from allies alike, be it true or falsified by both (the latter in other to give plausible deniability), Gerrera's image eroded overtime and leaned more into extremism.

He rescued Jyn from Lah'mu and brought her to the planet Wrea, where he had an outpost set up that was still mostly empty of occupants. He revealed his dislike for droids after Jyn suggested he obtain a unit. The day after her arrival, Jyn found a training ground set up with hanging husks of dilapidated droids used for targeting practice by Saw. Jyn then asked for Saw's help in training to fight. On the third day of her stay, she got the chance to practice her hand to hand skills on several sets of stormtrooper armor Saw had put up for her benefit. Gerrera had many partisans, including Reece Tallent, a human who Gerrera personally trained, the Twi'lek Xosad Hozem, and Idryssa Barruck, who Jyn took a liking to. Supplying the fighters with a place to stay, food, although mainly in the form of nutritive milk, and operations for them to undertake, Wrea became a hub for various rebel fighters to visit for various reasons.\n\nIn 10 BBY, Saw allowed Jyn to accompany him while he negotiated with Enfys Nest for coaxium obtained from the syndicate Crimson Dawn.\n\nIn 9 BBY, Saw received military information stolen from the Empire by Cal Kestis, who had maintained liaison with Saw since they first met on Kashyyyk.\n\nIn 6 BBY, Saw and several other members of his Partisans were hired by Arane Oreida to go to Inusagi and to infiltrate Sakoola blossom festival and kill Governor Cor Tophervin. He and his Partisans massacred the festival, killing Imperials, the Inusagi chieftess, guests and many Inusagian civilians to send a message to the Empire.\n\nAs Jyn matured, and as Saw became increasingly paranoid over time, he came to fear that Jyn would eventually be recognized as the daughter of a known Imperial collaborator and thus exploited to be used as a ransom against Galen. To help prevent this, Saw tortured Partisans to assess if they knew of Jyn's identity, even disposing of Jari at an unknown Imperial barracks due to the same reason. With the constant worry of others finding out Jyn's identity Saw decided, when Jyn was sixteen, to abandon her in a bunker with nothing more than a knife and a blaster for protection. He had instructed her to wait in the bunker until morning, by which time Saw was gone. He came to justify the decision by telling himself, and later her, that she was already one of his best people and that he knew she could survive without his aid. The decision was seen as a betrayal by Jyn, left a feeling of disenchantment for Saw, and for the rebellion in general, in her mind.\n\n",

Hundreds of Iziz citizens gathered to witness the proceedings and listened to Rash's speech, where he declared Dendup and Saw traitors deserving of death by beheading. Rash prepared his MagnaGuards and their electrostaffs to behead Dendup utilizing an electroguillotine. However, trooper Dono, having relayed to Steela and Bonteri that Saw had been arrested, put into motion a raid to free Dendup and Saw from the Separatists\u2014Bonteri tossed smoke bombs into the Separatist ranks, causing chaos while Steela and other soldiers extracted Saw and Dendup. Saw even managed to knock Kalani to the ground with his binders before the group began their withdrawal. The retreat was cut short, however, when B2 battle droid reinforcements surrounded Steela's extraction team and forced her troopers to surrender their weapons\u2014much to the dismay of the Onderonian citizens, who had come to see Saw's rebels as allies, and Rash's Separatists as intruding invaders. Having regained control of the function, Rash prepared to execute Dendup and Saw once more along with the newly incarcerated Steela.\n\nHaving surrendered to his fate, Saw thanked his sister for her attempt to save his life. General Tandin on the other hand, having heard the truth in Saw's words hours prior, decided not to surrender Saw and Dendup to the fate Rash intended for them. He then tore into the square with his Onderon guards and held King Rash and Kalani at laser lance point. Saw was touched and surprised that Tandin had abandoned King Rash's Royal Court, and sided with the Onderonian rebels. Tandin used Rash as a human shield and ordered the rebels to flee into the city, thanking Saw for helping him see that he had betrayed the true Onderon by serving King Rash. The Royal Militia followed Saw and the rebels to their safehouse while Tano helped Tandin escape Rash and his forces.\n\nSometime later, Tandin expressed to King Dendup that he had, thanks to well-expressed words from Saw, officially defected from the Separatist-led Onderon Royal Court and pledged himself and his army to Saw's rebels and Dendup. Dendup, like Steela, believed that to win the civil war, they had to win the minds of the people. Saw agreed, and made it his priority to protect Dendup from the Confederate strength of Count Dooku who no doubt wanted Dendup dead more than ever after the day's debacle.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Dealings with Axis[]\n\nAfter the raid on the Imperial garrison on Aldhani in 5 BBY, Luthen Rael traveled to Gerrera's base on Segra Milo and met with him. Getting down to business, Rael offered the freedom fighter the opportunity to trade several pieces of stolen Imperial technology, including a full set of Imperial drive adapters and three sealed Steergard targeting deflectors. After Rael confirmed that he had the items with him, Gerrera asked for him to set his price.\n\nTo Gerrera's surprise, Rael asked that he meet Anto Kreegyr, a contact who has been probing the Imperial power station at Spellhaus. Rael continued by saying that Kreegyr has found some weaknesses in the defense, but that he had an angle. Since Kreegyr was a Separatist, Gerrera dismissed Rael's offer, but Rael insisted that Gerrera hear Kreegyr out. As Gerrera was unwilling to work with Kreegyr, Rael stated that technology would come on the condition that he work with Kreegyr, warning him that he would go to someone else if he did not comply.\n\nGerrera insisted on working alone, but Rael asserted that that would have to change, telling Gerrera that they needed to work together to bring down the Empire. Gerrera persisted by saying that he was not a mercenary, but Rael asked him to imagine Spellhaus in flames. After listing a number of fallen rebel alliances, Gerrera asked what Rael was trying to accomplish. Rael responded by saying that he was a coward and was terrified that the Empire's power would grow beyond their means to stop it. He carried on by saying that they needed to put aside their differences, but Gerrera countered by claiming that he was the only one with clarity of purpose. Laughing, Rael stated that anarchy was a seductive concept for a man hiding in cold caves and begging for spare parts. Despite this, Gerrera refused to buy parts from Rael, telling him to find someone else to help Kreegyr.\n\nA little more than a month later, Gerrera had reconsidered his position and met with Rael a second time to join Kreegyr's attack on the Spellhaus power station. He told Rael that he would provide air power, but that aside from being told when it was needed he would be taking no tactical orders from Kreegyr and that his terms were non-negotiable. With the attack just a day away, Rael said he was too late. Since Gerrera would not back down so easily, Rael reluctantly explained that the ISB had learned of the imminent attack and would be waiting for the rebels on arrival at Spellhaus. Gerrera asked how Rael knew he would not warn Kreegyr, to which Rael replied that Gerrera was completely unpredictable. He continued by stating the decision to warn Kreegyr was now Gerrera's, but to consider the repercussions of both outcomes.\n\nDeducing that Rael must have an informant in the ISB, Gerrera began looking around his HQ, wondering if a spy was among his own ranks. Rael said that Gerrera was avoiding the matter at hand, but Gerrera demanded to know who the spy was. Rael claimed Benthic was his man who told him everything, to which Benthic stepped forward in protest. Rael swiftly took Benthic's blaster from his holster and pointed it at Gerrera to get him to listen. Rael elaborated on how the ISB would become arrogant after Kreegyr's downfall, giving them a \"clear field to play.\" He commented the alternative would lead to doubt and distrust in the ISB just as Gerrera is exhibiting now. Confirming a final time that thirty-one men would be sacrificed for this, Gerrera decided against warning Kreegyr for the sake of the war.\n\n",

Three days later, Gerrera found Vak-Nhalis at a cantina in the city of Quovel'cha. Dismissing local Imperial propaganda, Gerrera joined Vak-Nhalis at his booth, surmising the mess was intended to draw him out, as he needed Vak-Nhalis to locate the cache and Vak-Nhalis apparently needed him, perhaps for transportation. Gerrera asked if Vak-Nhalis meant to capture him or kill him and hijack his ship, to which Vak-Nhalis replied that either would do.\n\nVak-Nhalis, who expected to be lured in turn, told Gerrera as much. The revolutionary admitted that finding Vak-Nhalis was no easy task, though credits helped immensely. Gerrera requested to relay a story before they fought; Vak-Nhalis obliged. With a nasty grin, the revolutionary recounted Onderon's proud royal history, its Republic-Separatist neutrality, and the usurpation of King Dendup by Separatist pawn Sanjay Rash, who lied about his rise to power, installed a regime loyal to himself, and enacted new laws under the pretense of stability, paralleling the current galactic state. Though he had liberated his king, Gerrera had failed to protect his world; the Emperor ordered Onderon to surrender their weapons and allies to a newly-installed governor. Expectant that the planet would fall in line, the Emperor was twice denied by Onderon, exposing the Imperial regime's lies about peace and stability as it tried to wipe out the Onderonian people.\n\nLater, as Gerrera was accompanied by Vorgorath and Rynark to trade red water from the planet Po'yin for weapons and credits, he learned of Vak-Nhalis' terrorist attack on Coruscant.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Raven's Peak[]\n\nAbout a year into the New Order, one of Gerrera's earliest operations against the Empire took place at an Imperial summit held on Eriadu. In the facility known as Raven's Peak, Governor Tarkin headed a table of five highly ranked officers, including Doctor Royce Hemlock. Gerrera lead a small infiltration team into the facility, disguised as stormtroopers, with the intention of completely destroying the base. Armed with remote explosives, the team stealthily littered the lower levels with them. When they were almost finished, Gerrera ran into another group of intruders: Clone Force 99. Gerrera explained his plan to the clones, to which Hunter protested, as they had a separate goal to track Hemlock to the location of imprisoned clone troopers. Despite logical counterarguments made by Tech, Gerrera insisted it needed to be done \"for the greater good.\"\n\nBefore the two group's conversation could conclude, a security team interrupted, forcing them to part ways. With the imperials alerted to their presence, Gerrera order his comrades to retreat to an escape shuttle, although they had failed to place detonators in the command center. Most of his team fought their way to the shuttle and off-world, at which point Gerrera promptly detonated the explosives. While the explosion destroyed the hangar and much of the interior, the command tower was left undamaged. Unbeknownst to Gerrera, it had also caused a power outage to the facility's skyrail, which Clone Force 99 was using to escape. Ultimately, due to Gerrera's actions, Hemlock's tracked shuttle was destroyed and Tech was forced to sacrifice himself to allow his companions to escape.\n\nGerrera fought against the Imperial Military and reorganized the Onderon resistance into a group he dubbed the Partisans. Around 18 BBY, he hired a Lasat mercenary and fought an Imperial squad under ISB Agent Kallus when they were sent to Onderon to bring peace; the mercenary and other allied partisans killed Kallus' entire unit, save Kallus himself Gerrera ultimately came to think Onderon was lost and thus retreated from his own homeworld, however.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Strained relationships[]\n\nGerrera's aggressive tactics including the killing of prisoners, civilians and violations of the rules of engagement created strife with members of the Rebel Alliance, whom Saw equally regarded as a source of frustration due to their focus on how the Galactic Empire would labels them and disliked their views on prioritizing while simultaneously enlisting his aid for more controversial missions. Mutually, the Rebel Alliance believed Gerrera's actions hurts them more than helps them and opined that his fatal flaw being that as a leader, Saw lacks the understanding of people valuing peace and order more than freedom and that his actions raises alarming concerns that the Rebel Alliance will replace the order the Galactic Empire represents with chaos and danger.\n\nChief among his strife with the leaders included Mon Mothma; he regarded her as weak and indecisive, though he did see fire in her, while Mothma regarded him as a war criminal and terrorist mired in cynicism. Gerrera also saw potential in Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper as effective soldiers for a mission to discover the Empire's secret superweapon. However, Gerrera's willingness to risk the lives of civilians in this quest strained his partnership with Ezra and Sabine. Ezra, who initially admired Gerrera's ability to acquire intelligence, became disillusioned with his ruthless and aggressive tactics. Gerrera believed that if a planet was lost, then there was no other option but to leave, which put him at odds with fellow Partisan Mari Kosan, who chose to stay with the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.\n\nGerrera became a mentor to Jyn Erso after she lost her parents to the Empire. Saw referred to Jyn as his daughter and taught her how to defend herself and gave her a datapad to teach herself more traditional subjects such as maths. Though Jyn ended up going on missions by the time she was fourteen, Saw was more hesitant to put her in danger and went out of his way to hide her true identity from others, including giving her a green scarf to cover up her mother's pendant. He abandoned her at the age of sixteen in order to protect her from other rebels who wanted to use her as a hostage due to her status as Galen Erso's daughter. Gerrera initially did not believe the Imperial defector Bodhi Rook's report that the Empire was building a new superweapon called the Death Star and had him tortured with a Bor Gullet. Despite his estranged relationship with Jyn, Gerrera was still able to inspire her to find the weakness in the Empire's superweapon in order to save the rebellion. Gerrera was unafraid of death and stayed behind when the Empire destroyed the Jedha Holy City.\n\nGerrera fought alongside Lux Bonteri to free their home planet of Onderon however the two often argued as Saw viewed Bonteri as more of a politician than a fighter with Saw's sister Steela working as a mediator between the two. Both where deeply saddened by her death. Following the rise of the Empire, Bonteri joined the Rebel Alliance instead of Gerrera's Partisans, which his goddaughter Maia did join. After Gerrera's death, Bonteri contacted his stepdaughter, a clerical worker loyal to the Empire, saying Gerrera's death had upset him more than he could have realized and for amnesty in exchange for surrendering to the Empire and disclosing all his information on the Rebel Alliance and their operations. She gave him a list of specific times and locations where he could turn himself in. Bonteri, however, instead used the locations to give Staven, the leader of the Dreamers, a group consisting of surviving Partisans, a supply of targets to hit.\n\nRuthless though he was, Gerrera carried several regrets throughout his life. He felt responsible for the death of his sister, Steela. Thus, he vowed to keep up his war against what he saw as evil, no matter what form his enemies took. Despite justifying his reasons for doing so, he deeply regretted abandoning Jyn Erso and leaving her on her own.\n\n",

Believing the Empire's existence to pose a threat to all they had fought for during the Clone Wars, Gerrera and his militia began pushing back against the Empire, drawing the attention of Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin. In response, Tarkin deployed experimental Clone Force 99 to deal with Gerrera's faction, though also as a test of Clone Force 99's loyalty. Upon arriving and seeing Gerrera's group, the squad refused to execute their orders, save for Crosshair, who insisted on fulfilling the mission. Gerrera and his men apprehended the squad of clones, but soon released them, giving Hunter, the squad's leader, a chance to pick a side. Gerrera then left with his militia, leaving the squad of clones alone. Later, a new squadron led by Crosshair, who had left the Clone Force 99 due to their defection from the Empire, arrived to finish the mission to eliminate Saw and his militia. However, Saw was already gone, and the only ones left were some militia members and some civilians. All were killed, including the Elite Squad Trooper ES-01, who refused to eliminate the civilians, causing him to be executed for treason by Crosshair.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Jalindi and a personal quest[]\n\nIn 1 BBY, Saw was first mentioned by Bail Organa, where he gave information that was supplied by Saw; primarily, a new relay being used by the Empire. When the Rebellion wanted to tap into the relay to learn what the Empire was doing, Saw, who had sent an astromech, appeared and stated that they were cowards, as they were not doing what it would take to win. After Mon Mothma cut off communications with him, Saw prepared to head to the relay to destroy it. He arrived on his U-Wing with the help of his pilot, Edrio. Upon opening the doors to drop bombs, he was surprised to see Ezra and Sabine, greeting the two while tossing out three packs of proton bombs onto the relay. Telling them that the bombs would detonate soon, he let them board his starfighter and proceeded to fly out of the area just as the bombs exploded, destroying the relay and killing Brom Titus.\n\nOutside in Jalindi's space, Hera contacted him and told him to return Ezra and Sabine. Saw agreed and prepared the process; however, a Star Destroyer suddenly appeared, forcing Saw to leave for Faos Station with them. During the trip, Saw told the two that he needed their help as, after the events on Geonosis, he still did not know what the Empire was building. Upon arriving at Faos Station, he, Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper boarded Freighter 2716.\n\nUpon investigating the materials, which were used for the construction of Star Destroyers, Saw claimed that the Empire was up to something. Continuing his investigation, they found Imperial stormtroopers on the ship and learned that the freighter was heading towards the remote Tonnis sector, cementing Saw's suspicions. When Chopper told him that hold 12 contained an Imperial shuttle, they went in and found prisoners, who were either power or reactor technicians. Later on when Ezra kept hearing \"singing,\" Chopper revealed that hold 17 was a restricted area. Upon opening the door to that hold, they encountered a death trooper, prompting Saw to fire at point-blank range, killing the trooper. Sabine tossed several smoke grenades into the room, which Saw used to blend in and take down several troopers.\n\nAfter clearing the area, one of the troopers managed to escape. Saw wanted to go after her, but Sabine told him not to. They inspected the mysterious cargo the troopers were protecting and realized that it was an unusually large kyber crystal. Saw, adamant in finding out what the Empire was building, reluctantly stayed to guard the crystal while Ezra and Sabine went to sabotage the hyperspace drive. However, he quickly betrayed them and stunned the two in the engine room.\n\nWhen Ezra and Sabine woke up, they asked Saw why he betrayed them. Saw stated that they were very close to finding out the secret weapon and told them to look on the screen. When the freighter arrived at the Tonnis sector, they only saw a single Star Destroyer. Confused, but still convinced of the Empire's nefarious designs with the crystal, he used Ezra's lightsaber to destroy the freighter's hyperdrive before firing onto the crystal's mounting, effectively turning the crystal into a time bomb. He then freed the two, while Edrio, who had tailed the freighter, informed Saw that he was outside. Knowing that Ezra and Sabine no longer agreed with his methods, Saw bid farewell to them while they made their individual escapes before the freighter and Star Destroyer were obliterated.\n\n",

As he waited, Gerrera began to tell a story from his younger days, reminiscing on his internment to a labour camp in the Onderonian jungle and the horrific conditions he faced, one of three hundred prisoners working in weather so hot they were forced to work naked. One day, everyone at the camp started to itch simultaneously, caused by a spillage of rhydonium that could be felt before being smelt. While everyone fled, Gerrera was the only one to stay, because the rhydo was 'new to [him]'. Wilmon then succeeded in arming the device, which caused rhydonium steam to begin spilling from a valve in front of them.\n\nGerrera approached the steam with glee and muttered about his love for it, causing Wilmon to react with alarm and confusion as he began huffing the rhydonium with no side effects. Gerrera could do so because he understood the rhydo, loving it like a sister and calling the burn a joy. He suspected Wilmon thought him crazy, but instead admitted that he was; revolution wasn't for the sane, but the broken and hunted like them still stand, despite knowing they won't live to see the Republic reborn. He questioned where Wilmon was at that moment, then began to howl that he was right there with Gerrera and ready to fight. Inspired by Gerrera's words, Wilmon removed his protective mask and began painfully breathing in the rhydo, fuelled by Gerrera's wild inspirations urging him to let it in. As Wilmon screamed in agony from the rhydo's burn, Gerrera cheered for him to let his newfound freedom run wild.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - An impassioned rebel[]\n\nSaw Gerrera had garnered a reputation as an able but ruthless and cunning commander during the Clone Wars and the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. His harsh methods led many to regard him as an unrepentant extremist. Despite his extremism, he did not like being considered a terrorist, since he had a different concept of that word than others. Rather, he considered himself a patriot, believed that resistance was not the same as terrorism and found it frustrating that members of the rebellion worried about how they would be labelled being the Empire would classify them negatively regardless. He also held a strong, personal disdain for both slavery and indentured servitude, finding little difference between the two; this aversion was notable by a young Jyn Erso, believing that Saw had to have experienced a mission that made the topic a particularly sensitive topic.\n\nGerrera harbored great antipathy towards the Separatists for invading his homeworld Onderon. He also disliked the Geonosians due to their alignment with the Separatists and for building gunships which led to his sister Steela's death. This coupled by the loss of his comrades during a mission on Geonosis led him to brutally interrogate the Geonosian Klik-Klak, much to the discomfort of his former comrade Rex and the Spectres. Gerrera also disagreed with some of the Jedi's principled tactics, believing them lacking and costing them the Clone Wars.\n\nDespite his antipathy towards the Geonosians, Gerrera was horrified by the Empire's genocide against the species and believed that they had the same right to rebuild as other species. Gerrera's change of heart led him to release Klik-Klak and the Geonosian queen egg he was guarding. He also still retained greater level of respect for Jedi, acknowledging their help in the past even when wanting to dismiss them and offering Cal Kestis a place in his rebel group, acknowledging that a Jedi would aid the Partisans in their fight against the Empire. When Kestis refused because he had his own mission, Gerrera said the invitation was open, not giving up on the idea of having Kestis on the side of the Partisans. Gerrera would later enlist the help of Kestis on multiple occasions.\n\n",

Three days later, Gerrera found Vak-Nhalis at a cantina in the city of Quovel'cha. Dismissing local Imperial propaganda, Gerrera joined Vak-Nhalis at his booth, surmising the mess was intended to draw him out, as he needed Vak-Nhalis to locate the cache and Vak-Nhalis apparently needed him, perhaps for transportation. Gerrera asked if Vak-Nhalis meant to capture him or kill him and hijack his ship, to which Vak-Nhalis replied that either would do.\n\nVak-Nhalis, who expected to be lured in turn, told Gerrera as much. The revolutionary admitted that finding Vak-Nhalis was no easy task, though credits helped immensely. Gerrera requested to relay a story before they fought; Vak-Nhalis obliged. With a nasty grin, the revolutionary recounted Onderon's proud royal history, its Republic-Separatist neutrality, and the usurpation of King Dendup by Separatist pawn Sanjay Rash, who lied about his rise to power, installed a regime loyal to himself, and enacted new laws under the pretense of stability, paralleling the current galactic state. Though he had liberated his king, Gerrera had failed to protect his world; the Emperor ordered Onderon to surrender their weapons and allies to a newly-installed governor. Expectant that the planet would fall in line, the Emperor was twice denied by Onderon, exposing the Imperial regime's lies about peace and stability as it tried to wipe out the Onderonian people.\n\nLater, as Gerrera was accompanied by Vorgorath and Rynark to trade red water from the planet Po'yin for weapons and credits, he learned of Vak-Nhalis' terrorist attack on Coruscant.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Recovering Vak-Nhalis[]\n\nLater that year, Gerrera, who had been fed rumors by prisoners of war about Separatist caches, orchestrated and participated in hijacking a starship belonging to Old Krezchak, a pirate raiding Confederacy installations across eight sectors. Krezchak refused to negotiate or surrender his cargo, leading to his death. Encountering the Separatist operative Soujen Vak-Nhalis, Gerrera ordered him to stop and, when the man attempted to flee, shot him with a modified DC-15A blaster carbine that overloaded his cybernetics. Gerrera asked if Vak-Nhalis felt its effects, which he affirmed.\n\nThe Onderonian questioned whether Vak-Nhalis, who had just awoken from a hibernation pod, knew about the Empire, ascertaining that the stranger was calculating how to kill him. Expediting the conversation, Gerrera revealed that he was aware of the saboteur's history and offered to let Vak-Nhalis accompany him or go down with the ship; Vak-Nhalis accepted the former. Explaining that Krezchak intended to auction Vak-Nhalis on Kafrene, Gerrera observed that Vak-Nhalis did not ask many questions, comparing him to a battle droid. Descending into the hatch connecting Krezchak's ship to his own, the Dalgo, Vak-Nhalis attacked Gerrera, aiming for the other man's back as to break his spine. The cyborg's ambush failed, and he was incapacitated by an ion mine clamped to the bulkhead. As Vak-Nhalis passed out, Gerrera provided his name, declaring that the Separatist belonged in his grave.\n\nGathered in a cavern, Gerrera conversed with two of his soldiers, Karama and Vorgorath. Karama criticized Gerrera, suggesting targeted strikes against guard posts and clone troopers; Gerrera dismissed clones as a tool of the enemy that could be replaced,  desiring instead to make fighting the war against the Empire a battle of attrition. Vorgorath disparaged Karama's constant questioning, but Gerrera, noting the pair's accomplishments, found the questions inoffensive, extending the sentiment to include answering Vak-Nhalis' inquiries if he proved useful.\n\nGerrera introduced Vak-Nhalis to Nankry, another guerrilla, but the assassin declined to test her skills. Vak-Nhalis took one of Gerrera's ration packs, causing the man to laugh, who in turn allowed the Separatist to eat. Gerrera asked whether Vak-Nhalis had heard of him, to which he did not reply, and spoke about Onderon's history with the Republic and the government's transition into the Empire, Gerrera comparing the self-appointed Emperor Palpatine to his own world's tyrant, King Rash. Vak-Nhalis accused Gerrera of looking for an excuse to fight, but the insurgent charged the Empire with tightening its grip on Onderon, murdering the Jedi, and instigating the conflict.\n\nNankry came at Vak-Nhalis while he ate, causing a short scuffle. The other guerrillas rose to their feet, though Gerrera stood back. The scrap, resulting in a stalemate, ended when Gerrera told his fighters to stand down, indicating to Vak-Nhalis that the attack, although lethal, had been a test. Vak-Nhalis threatened Gerrera with death if it happened again, which he agreed was fair before requesting that they speak privately. Alone, Gerrera explained the need for supplies to fight the Empire to Vak-Nhalis, recounting the rumors that led him to the pirate ship that he had salvaged the assassin from. Gerrera deduced that the operative was himself a Separatist contingency, which Vak-Nhalis did not deny, before inquiring how much of him was machine or man and if he had been conscripted.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The true cost of conflict[]\n\nThe war raged on and the resistance eventually moved their headquarters from the urban population of Iziz to the remote eastern mountain range known as the Onderon highlands, where, back in the jungle, Saw was reunited with his team. At the highlands, Saw and the rebels constructed a new base, known as \"the nest;\" named for the rupings who used the highlands as a nesting ground. During this time, Padawan Tano and Bonteri enacted a quick mission back to Iziz where they utilized a holographic message of King-in-exile Dendup declared his allegiance to the Onderon rebels, whom he called patriots of true Onderon. Upon their return, Bonteri informed Saw that the civilians had taken to the Iziz streets to riot as a result of hearing Dendup's message. Encouraged, Saw voiced his desire to join the civilians and take the fight straight to Rash in the streets of Iziz, but Steela, Tano, Tandin, and King Dendup, all disagreed\u2014they believed the rebels needed to avoid civilian casualties at all costs, thus the Confederate forces had to be drawn out of the crowded city and into the wilderness of the highlands.\n\nIt wasn't long before Kalani located the rebels in the highlands and sent his army out to confront them. Meanwhile, the rebels and Royal bodyguards dug into the jungle mesas and prepared to repel the droid infantry. Once the battle of the Onderonian highlands began, Saw led a group of ruping riders, providing air support for the dalgo-mounted cavalry commanded by Tandin. The Confederate forces were caught off-guard by the rebels attack and were mostly destroyed by the rebels diverse forces of rupings, cavalry, snipers, and blaster cannons mounted on towering fambaas. Saw and his riders swept over the battlefront, destroying the droid's support vehicles with grenades. However, before the skirmish could be won, three HMP droid gunships entered the fray and systematically turned the tide of battle by killing much of Tandin's cavalry and fambaas. Saw's ruping riders were downed by two, and Saw was forced to hide from the droid fighters and recollect himself. Seizing the next opportunity, Saw bore his ruping towards a distracted gunship and lobbed a detonator at the hovering droid. However, the detonator did no damage to the craft as it was heavily ray shielded. The gunship next targeted Saw, and it managed to kill his ruping, throwing Saw to the ground. With the battle's tide having turned, Tandin's cavalry retreated, and the Royal General hoisted Saw atop his dalgo as the surviving rebel forces retreated back to the nest in complete disarray.\n\nAt the nest, the Gerreras, Tandin, Tano, and Bonteri convened to strategize. Tano explained that she had contacted her Jedi superiors Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and requested aid from the Jedi Council, but he wasn't sure he would be able to help the rebels. Refusing to be discouraged, Steela pointed out that since the droid could not be stopped before reaching the nest, the fort had to be fortified for the incoming invasion. Emboldened by her spirit, Saw expressed how proud he was of his sister. She accredited her skills as a leader to watching Saw. Saw returned to organize the defense at the battlefront a short distance from the nest, and shortly, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela arrived bearing new armaments provided by Skywalker and Kenobi through the Weequay Hondo Ohnaka, the pirate lord of the Ohnaka Gang: Sienar Fleet Systems RPS-6 rocket launchers. Saw immediately took one of the rocket launchers and fired a missile at a nearby gunship. The droid ship was brought down by the single shot; revitalizing the rebels' resolve to fight now that they had a weapon that could deal damage. The launchers were being distributed among the insurgents, when word came that the nest had been found and was under attack by the remaining gunships.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Reuniting with Jyn and death[]\n\nIn 1 BBY, just prior to the Battle of Scarif, the Partisans captured Bodhi Rook, a recently defected Imperial pilot. Bodhi carried a message from Galen Erso, who was trying to alert the Rebellion to the nearly-completed Death Star project. However, increasingly paranoid and believing that Imperial spies were everywhere, Gerrera was convinced that the defection was a trick by the Empire. To ascertain the truth, Gerrera used a mairan named Bor Gullet to read Rook's mind, at the risk of driving him insane. Afterward, he left the catatonic Rook in a cell, before deploying his men under Benthic and Edrio to attack an Imperial kyber convoy in Jedha City. In the ensuing firefight, Rebel intelligence Captain Cassian Andor, along with Jyn Erso, were captured: both were on the moon in search of Rook, whom the Rebel Alliance had learned had a message from Galen Erso.\n\nJyn and Cassian, along with \u00cemwe and Malbus, who had been caught up in the fighting, were brought to Saw's headquarters in the Catacombs of Cadera. Saw would see only Jyn. He questioned her on why she was there, demanding to know if she was there to kill him. She told him that she was there to ask for the message from her father and when it was given to the Rebel Alliance she would be on her way. Saw asked her why she did not believe in the dream of freedom throughout the galaxy. She told him about how he abandoned her at the age of sixteen and that his war did not mean anything to her. He then showed her the message from her father which revealed the weakness in the Empire's superweapon. However, as they spoke, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Orson Krennic had resolved to test-fire the Death Star's superlaser on Jedha, having traced Bodhi there and seeing an opportunity to wipe out Saw's insurgency. A low-power shot wiped out Jedha City in an instant and created a blast wave that spread for kilometers in every direction, threatening the Catacombs. Realizing the threat, Saw released his prisoners, commending Galen's message to Jyn and begging her to save the Rebellion. However, he declared that he would \"run no longer\" and remained in the Catacombs. After seeing Jyn's party escape, his last act was to tear off his breath mask before the blast wave consumed the Catacombs, killing him. His last thoughts were for his late sister, Steela, and his last word was her name.\n\n",

He and his sister, Steela Gerrera, were instrumental in the rebel liberation of their homeworld during the Onderonian Civil War. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire at the end of the war, Saw became a key member in the fight against the fascist government and the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. His tactics during the early rebellion against the Empire led him to be seen as an extremist, one whose notoriety was recognized by both the Empire, the Alliance, and, many years later, the New Republic.\n\nIn the early resistance against the Separatist Alliance on Onderon, Gerrera and his fellow soldiers were outnumbered and outgunned by the Separatist Droid Army. They requested help from the Jedi High Council, which led the Grand Army of Republic in its fight against the Separatists, but the Jedi Order chose not to become actively involved in the fighting on Onderon. Instead, they sent a team of advisors\u2014Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Commander Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain Rex\u2014to train the Onderonian fighters. The Jedi and Captain Rex taught them proper techniques and strategies for taking on the battle droid army, and, through their efforts, the rebels began to turn the tide. Gerrera came to resent that the rebels chose Steela as their leader, and he was soon captured in an ill-concocted solo effort to rescue the deposed King Ramsis Dendup from the Separatists. They were both rescued by the rebels, who eventually mounted a final battle against the Separatists. Through their efforts, the rebels liberated their world and returned Dendup to the throne. The fight, however, came at a personal cost: Steela was killed during the final battle, and Gerrera was left to mourn his sister\u2014feeling responsible for her death.\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire. Horrified, Gerrera and his fellow Onderonians resisted the Empire, and the Empire, despite the fact that Saw and his team had been instrumental in the liberation of Onderon, branded them as insurgents. Gerrera managed to evade Imperial capture, and he continued to fight against the Empire. During this time, Saw relocated Imperial scientist Galen Erso, his wife, Lyra, and their daughter, Jyn, to the uninhabited planet of Lah'mu. When Orson Krennic, an old friend of Galen's, discovered their location and took Galen away and killed Lyra, Saw traveled to Lah'mu, adopted Jyn, and raised her, all the while claiming that she was his own daughter.\n\nGerrera fought against the Imperial Military and led a resistance group known as the Partisans, a militant organization that some considered an extremist organization, using terrorist tactics and operating under the codename, \"Stoneface.\" His resistance cell, a continuation of his Onderonian resistance, was one of the first in the group of cells that formed the Rebel Alliance. He was later involved in the early campaigns of the Rebel Alliance, by which time his more-extreme tactics had come to stand in stark contrast with those of Alliance leaders Bail Organa and Mon Mothma. Gerrera eventually cut ties with Organa and Mothma, who viewed him as a militant and extremist.\n\nHaving learned that the Empire's massive kyber crystal had come from Jedha, Saw and the Partisans based their operation there. After the capture of an Imperial ensign, Bodhi Rook, who claimed that the Empire was building a planet-killer, Saw was reunited with Jyn, whom the Alliance had sent to meet with him. Since Rook had sent him a message from Jyn's father, Gerrera showed it to her, which revealed that the Empire was constructing a planet-killing superweapon called the Death Star. As the message played, however, the Death Star struck Jedha City and destroyed it. As the ripple of the explosion reached them, Gerrera told Jyn he was done running and stayed at the base, and was killed by the aftermath of the blast.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The King's blessing[]\n\nShortly, Saw and the rebel leadership returned to their safehouse and were informed by trooper Dono that former King Dendup was scheduled to be executed by King Rash the next day in the central Yolahn Square. Steela surmised that Rash intended to kill his predecessor simply as an example to the rebels; to humiliate the freedom fighters and their cause. Tano reasoned that if Dendup was executed he would become a martyr and bolster the rebel cause. For his part, however, Saw ignored both the words of the war advisor and his sister and took it upon himself to rescue King Dendup before Rash even had a chance to publicly declare Dendup a traitor. Steela ordered Saw to stand down, but Saw, believing that his life was worth the risk of preserving Dendup's, covertly set out nonetheless, unaware that Steela had tasked Dono to tail him.\n\nAfter donning a cloak, Saw jogged to the foot of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square and scaled the multistory temple utilizing a grappling hook. Once atop the temple roof, Saw quickly spotted King Dendup in the temple courtyard and beheaded a nearby sentry droid while making his way to him. Saw bowed before his lord, swearing fealty to the former king and introduced himself, explaining to the king the execution situation. In angst, Dendup chastised Saw for \"interfering with the affairs of the throne\" by forming the resistance and confessed to Saw his failure as Saw's king: by not choosing to ally Onderon with either the Republic or the Confederacy during the Separatist Crisis, a side had been chosen for him; and as a result of Dendup's choice not to choose, the Onderonian Civil War had broken out, and Onderonians like Saw had stepped up to rectify his errs. Nonplussed, Saw encouraged Dendup, surprising the king with news that the rebels had the support of the Jedi Order. Greatly encouraged, Dendup agreed to escape with Saw, but when Saw fired his grappling hook to escape the royal prison courtyard, he was frustrated to find that it was blocked by a one-way shield, which alerted the Unifar Temple to the intrusion. As klaxons wailed and spotlights targeted, Saw and Dendup were taken into custody by a sextet of droidekas.\n\nSaw was transferred to the royal central command of the palace, where at Kalani and King Rash's order, Saw was cuffed and hung in a containment field and placed under interrogation by Kalani. General Akenathen Tandin of the Royal Onderon Militia supervised the investigation. Kalani tortured Saw for throughout the night but Saw the patriot of Onderon refused to divulge to the droid general any of of the rebel secrets. As a result, Kalani grew increasingly embittered, so he hiked up the dose of electric torture and the longevity of the doses; hoping Saw would break down. His body smoking from the electricity, Saw held to his beliefs and will and suffered the torture until Kalani and his EV-series medical droid heightened the electric shocks to great enough wattage to easily kill Saw. Saw hung while the torture took its toll not only on his body, but on his mind and spirit; Saw hardened himself and had begun on his irreversible path to becoming a remorseless soldier. Tandin, feeling sympathetic to his fellow Onderonian, commanded Kalani and his droids to give Saw rest. Kalani reluctantly agreed.\n\nShortly, Saw was given a drink of tea by Tandin, who questioned why Saw had chosen to rebel against Rash's throne, believing that Onderon's past under the rule of Ramsis Dendup was outdated, and the future was Onderon under Confederate rule. Saw explained that he chose to rebel because King Rash misused the power of the kingship to empower himself, rather than the people. Saw boomed over Tandin's arguments, proclaiming that he fought in Dendup's name for the former king had chosen to politically fight for the people, therefore not choosing to side with either the Republic or the Confederacy for his own gain as Rash so quickly had. Saw's words of patriotism weighed heavily on Tandin.\n\nThe next day, Rash and Kalani, escorted by a quartet of IG-100 MagnaGuards, marched King Dendup and Saw in chains to the steps of the Unifar Temple overlooking Yolahn Square to their intended executions. Hundreds of Iziz citizens gathered to witness the proceedings and listened to Rash's speech, where he declared Dendup and Saw traitors deserving of death by beheading. Rash prepared his MagnaGuards and their electrostaffs to behead Dendup utilizing an electroguillotine. However, trooper Dono, having relayed to Steela and Bonteri that Saw had been arrested, put into motion a raid to free Dendup and Saw from the Separatists\u2014Bonteri tossed smoke bombs into the Separatist ranks, causing chaos while Steela and other soldiers extracted Saw and Dendup. Saw even managed to knock Kalani to the ground with his binders before the group began their withdrawal. The retreat was cut short, however, when B2 battle droid reinforcements surrounded Steela's extraction team and forced her troopers to surrender their weapons\u2014much to the dismay of the Onderonian citizens, who had come to see Saw's rebels as allies, and Rash's Separatists as intruding invaders. Having regained control of the function, Rash prepared to execute Dendup and Saw once more along with the newly incarcerated Steela.\n\nHaving surrendered to his fate, Saw thanked his sister for her attempt to save his life. General Tandin on the other hand, having heard the truth in Saw's words hours prior, decided not to surrender Saw and Dendup to the fate Rash intended for them. He then tore into the square with his Onderon guards and held King Rash and Kalani at laser lance point. Saw was touched and surprised that Tandin had abandoned King Rash's Royal Court, and sided with the Onderonian rebels. Tandin used Rash as a human shield and ordered the rebels to flee into the city, thanking Saw for helping him see that he had betrayed the true Onderon by serving King Rash. The Royal Militia followed Saw and the rebels to their safehouse while Tano helped Tandin escape Rash and his forces.\n\nSometime later, Tandin expressed to King Dendup that he had, thanks to well-expressed words from Saw, officially defected from the Separatist-led Onderon Royal Court and pledged himself and his army to Saw's rebels and Dendup. Dendup, like Steela, believed that to win the civil war, they had to win the minds of the people. Saw agreed, and made it his priority to protect Dendup from the Confederate strength of Count Dooku who no doubt wanted Dendup dead more than ever after the day's debacle.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Taking the fight to the Confederacy[]\n\nLater in the day, posing as hunters, the rebels and military advisors boarded a pair of dalgo-yoked Mandalorian transports and traveled to Iziz and fooled the \"dim-witted\" OOM command battle droid checkpoint in order to gain pass through the city's ray shielded main gate. The rebels then split up; Saw alerted other rebels already within the city that the time to fight had come, while Steela, Bonteri, Tano, and others went in search of new recruits.\n\nAs time went on, many more Onderonians enlisted with the independence fighters and they took shelter in a safe house deep in the city. Holding Iziz under siege from within, Saw, Bonteri, and Steela received regular intelligence and guidance from not only Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, and Rex, but the Jedi Masters on Coruscant as well. Saw and the rebels took as many chances as they could to disrupt battle droid patrols and destroy droids harassing Iziz civilians, engaging in as many as five engagements in a single day\u2014sometimes, even in high-traffic areas, such as Malgan Market. Saw often opened fire on Separatist minions publicly, which caused fear to mount in the civilian population, despite the fact that civilian casualties sat at zero.\n\nOne day, Saw and his resistance held a meeting in their Iziz safehouse, where Skywalker congratulated them on waging a thus-far successful campaign. Kenobi and Tano, however, believed that the public perception of Saw's rebels had not gone as planned; the people were growing ever more fearful of the sudden violence that had besieged their city. Saw, however, believed that the people were fearful simply because the droids were still active\u2014that he hadn't done enough to demobilize the Confederates. Steela and Bonteri added that they had to assure the general populace that the freedom fighters were just that: fighting for the freedom of the people. Steela believed the rebels had to win the hearts and minds of the people to gain their trust, something Saw did not understand. In order to prove to the civilians that the rebels could oust the Separatists, Bonteri proposed that they strike the Onderon power generator. In agreement, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Rex returned to the Core Worlds, having outfitted the rebels as planned.\n\nThe Jedi Knights pledged that they would continue to provide credits to the Saw's movement and also stationed Tano to remain on Onderon. At dusk, Saw, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela scouted out the power generator complex. Lying prone on a rooftop, Bonteri explained that if they could manage to disable the power compound it would cause a city-wide power outage, which, given time, would bring the Droid Army to a literal standstill: the droids operated independently of a control computer, but still had to recharge periodically using power cells. However, before assaulting the generators, the rebels concluded that they needed to know more about the compound. Saw took it upon himself to gather the desired intel: he quickly descended the building and brutishly ripped the head off of a patrolling \"clanker\" in the street and returned to the rooftop where a robolobotomy was performed using a Republic-provided device. From the holographic images provided from the cranial unit, Saw and the rebels came to the conclusion that any attack on the compound would be futile; the droids were too numerous. Bonteri, however, saw an opportunity and added that if they had enough firepower it could be done with a hijacked Separatist Assault Tank .\n\nIn order to secure the tank, the resistance concocted a ruse: on a nearby street, the rebel Dono detonated an EMP-loaded airspeeder in the path of droid Patrol 118, beginning the attack. Saw, utilizing droid poppers and a DC-15A blaster carbine, took down the entire patrol, with the exception of the commander droid. The rebels let the commander call for reinforcements, hoping that the Separatists would deliver aid in the form of an Assault Tank. First, however, a pair of droidekas were sent in. Outmatched from the front, Saw and Bonteri navigated behind the droidekas in a flanking maneuver.\n\nTrue to his training, Saw rolled his EMP grenade into the droideka's bubble shield and successfully disabled it, but Bonteri's grenade went too fast and alerted the other droideka to the danger behind. The droid turned and fired at its adversaries, but Saw acted quickly, shoving Bonteri to safety. Saw dove behind the disabled droideka, but was pinned down, so Steela leaped into action and deposited a droid popper gently into the droideka's shield bubble, disabling it. Just then, the desired Assault Tank rumbled onto the street and fired on the rebels. Saw and Bonteri rapidly closed the distance between them and the tank, taking down its B2-series super battle droid escorts on the way, and disabled the repulsorcraft using the duel droid popper strategy, just as they were trained. Saw then boarded the tank and attempted to get it running again, but to no avail. Steela, however, having a self-described \"woman's touch,\" and being the better pilot of the two of them, managed to start it up once more.\n\nSaw piloted the tank to the entrance to the generator compound and blew in the compound's two metal gateways. Steela sniped the droid guards while Saw waited for the tank's laser cannon to recharge. Bonteri and Steela fought off several BX-series droid commandos before Saw was able to target the generator itself, and when he fired on it, the ensuing explosion plunged the entire city into darkness. Saw donned night vision goggles in order to see, and was pleased to see that the freedom fighters were being cheered on by the Iziz citizens. Saw, Steela, Tano, and Bonteri returned to the safehouse and celebrated, raising drinks for Onderon.

Kenobi added, however, that the time had come for the movement to elect an official leader. Confident that he would be elected by popular vote, Saw was disheartened when instead Steela was chosen by the Onderonian soldiers.

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Skills and abilities[]\n\nIn his youth, Saw was trained and learned the art of combat by the Jedi and Republic, specifically from both Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex. This training afforded him skills in reconnaissance, infiltration, leadership, and knowledge in weaponry and military tactics able to contend with Separatist forces more effectively. Overtime, he also became knowledgeable in various droid model and their weaknesses. Like other Onderonian outcasts, Gerrera could also domesticate other animals such as a ruping.\n\nA battle hardened veteran during the Age of the Empire, Saw's greatest attribute was his intellect and leadership skills as a military tactician, which only improved and sharpened over time. He was an effective military commander who was adept in extracting information and launching hit-and-run raids on the Empire. Contrary to the rest of the rebels however, he was unrestrained by ethical concerns and as a result, willing to do just about anything to bring down his enemies, which caused friction with other Rebel factions. Gerrera was a feared insurgent, having had successful scores in the Arkanis sector while often leaving no survivors.\n\nIn combat, Gerrera was skilled in both armed and unarmed combat; In armed combat, he was well-versed in the usage of melee weaponry such as a staff, truncheons, and knives in addition to ranged weaponry like a blaster, snipers, and explosives. A capable hand-to-hand combatant, he was skilled enough to able to overpower both Ezra, Rex and incapacitate both stormtroopers and even death troopers.\n\nSaw later suffered severe injuries to his lungs and legs which forced him to wear a pressure suit for survival and to walk on prosthetic legs.\n\n",

He rescued Jyn from Lah'mu and brought her to the planet Wrea, where he had an outpost set up that was still mostly empty of occupants. He revealed his dislike for droids after Jyn suggested he obtain a unit. The day after her arrival, Jyn found a training ground set up with hanging husks of dilapidated droids used for targeting practice by Saw. Jyn then asked for Saw's help in training to fight. On the third day of her stay, she got the chance to practice her hand to hand skills on several sets of stormtrooper armor Saw had put up for her benefit. Gerrera had many partisans, including Reece Tallent, a human who Gerrera personally trained, the Twi'lek Xosad Hozem, and Idryssa Barruck, who Jyn took a liking to. Supplying the fighters with a place to stay, food, although mainly in the form of nutritive milk, and operations for them to undertake, Wrea became a hub for various rebel fighters to visit for various reasons.\n\nIn 10 BBY, Saw allowed Jyn to accompany him while he negotiated with Enfys Nest for coaxium obtained from the syndicate Crimson Dawn.\n\nIn 9 BBY, Saw received military information stolen from the Empire by Cal Kestis, who had maintained liaison with Saw since they first met on Kashyyyk.\n\nIn 6 BBY, Saw and several other members of his Partisans were hired by Arane Oreida to go to Inusagi and to infiltrate Sakoola blossom festival and kill Governor Cor Tophervin. He and his Partisans massacred the festival, killing Imperials, the Inusagi chieftess, guests and many Inusagian civilians to send a message to the Empire.\n\nAs Jyn matured, and as Saw became increasingly paranoid over time, he came to fear that Jyn would eventually be recognized as the daughter of a known Imperial collaborator and thus exploited to be used as a ransom against Galen. To help prevent this, Saw tortured Partisans to assess if they knew of Jyn's identity, even disposing of Jari at an unknown Imperial barracks due to the same reason. With the constant worry of others finding out Jyn's identity Saw decided, when Jyn was sixteen, to abandon her in a bunker with nothing more than a knife and a blaster for protection. He had instructed her to wait in the bunker until morning, by which time Saw was gone. He came to justify the decision by telling himself, and later her, that she was already one of his best people and that he knew she could survive without his aid. The decision was seen as a betrayal by Jyn, left a feeling of disenchantment for Saw, and for the rebellion in general, in her mind.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Freeing Wookiees[]\n\nSometime later in 14 BBY, Gerrera and several of his Partisans traveled to Kashyyyk. There, he used a DH-16 Blaster Pistol. The Partisans discovered that one of the Empire's refineries was using wroshyr tree sap to make a powerful compound. Following that, they met Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis, who they asked for help in their attempts to free the Wookiees.\n\nIn return for Kestis' assistance in the attack on Kashyyyk, the Partisans agreed to search for Wookiee Chieftan Tarfful, who could aid Kestis in searching for a Jedi holocron with the names of several force-sensitive children. After the takeover of the refinery, Gerrera made a speech to encourage the flame of rebellion against the Empire and offered Kestis a place among the Partisans, saying that it would be nice to have a Jedi fighting at his side. Kestis felt honored by the offer, but he refused because he could not abandon his mission. Gerrera said the offer continued before it leaves. After finding Tarfful in the Shadowlands, the Partisans became overwhelmed by the Imperial forces, and the majority were forced to retreat before Kestis returned to Kashyyyk. Those who remained on Kashyyyk did so to Gerrera's disdain.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Helping hand from the Jedi[]\n\nApproximately two standard years later, in 20 BBY, Saw had become the self-proclaimed de facto leader of the Onderon rebels, and as a result of being banished from Iziz, the rebels took up residence in an abandoned outpost within a group of ancient ruins in Sector S-29 of the wilderness. Around this time, Lux Bonteri, the son of the late Mina Bonteri, the former senator of Onderon in the Republic's Galactic Senate joined Saw and his resistance. Having obtained enough armor, blasters, and various other small arms to supply their forces, Saw, Steela, and Bonteri plotted to take back Iziz for Onderon; the rebel leaders, however, after a number of small skirmishes with battle droid forces, came to the realization that they were both under-equipped and had neither the training nor skills to wage open war against the Confederacy. Therefore, Saw and Bonteri reached out to the Republic, requesting aid even though Gerrera had no personal loyalty to the Republic government: in his mind, a pact with the Republic was simply a way to ensure Onderon secured its freedom.\n\nUltimately, the esteemed Jedi High Council on the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, heard Saw and Bonteri's story via HoloNet transmission. Grand Master Yoda promised that the Jedi Order would find a way to aid them. A short time later, the freedom fighters were alerted to an intrusion in the jungle Sector S-11 and Steela led a squad to investigate. Shortly, Steela, mounted on a dalgo steed, returned with Yoda's promise: Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Togruta Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and 501st Legion clone trooper Rex. Saw, mounted on his reptavian ruping, welcomed the four Republic Military advisors to his world. Skywalker informed Saw that they couldn't fight the Onderonian Civil War for the resistance\u2014Onderon, after all, was legitimately aligned with the Confederacy, no matter how illegitimate Saw viewed the situation\u2014but he would train Saw's resistance to fight well on their own. While Gerrera and his comrades had wanted the Republic to be directly involved in their struggle, they still appreciated the aid and believed it to be a good deal.\n\nRex explained that, as a clone trooper, he would assist the Jedi Generals. After relocating a half-kilometer to a clearing in the jungle where a captured Separatist Armored Assault Tank was left dormant, Jedi Commander Tano and Clone Captain Rex instructed the freedom fighters on how to disable the tank: they had drop a pair of Electro Magnetic Pulse grenades\u2014\"droid poppers\"\u2014into both the tank's cockpits, one for the pilot and one for the gunner. Saw and Bonteri teamed for the exercise, but sharing in a tense rivalry, incidentally sabotaged one another by refusing to cooperate. Disgusted, Saw ridiculed Bonteri for being a \"terrible soldier,\" which disappointed the Jedi advisors. As the day wore on, Saw grew increasingly frustrated, berating Steela for regularly attending to Bonteri, with whom she shared a mutual attraction. As the confrontation between Saw and Bonteri almost came to blows, Steela defused the two men, explaining that there would be both a time for the direct fight that Saw desired, and the political speeches that Bonteri excelled at.\n\nThe rebels next returned to the encampment, where General Skywalker and Rex demonstrated how to most efficiently disable droideka security droids. Protected by a deflector shield, droidekas were immune to blaster bolts. Skywalker, thus, indicated that a slowly rolled droid popper was the best way to disable the droids. Confident in his abilities, Saw stepped up and attempted the technique first; however, he rolled the grenade too quickly and failed to penetrate the shield. Bonteri tried next and succeeded. Later, after many tries and much coaching from Tano, Saw managed to roll the grenade at the right speed and pierce the shield.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - An impassioned rebel[]\n\nSaw Gerrera had garnered a reputation as an able but ruthless and cunning commander during the Clone Wars and the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. His harsh methods led many to regard him as an unrepentant extremist. Despite his extremism, he did not like being considered a terrorist, since he had a different concept of that word than others. Rather, he considered himself a patriot, believed that resistance was not the same as terrorism and found it frustrating that members of the rebellion worried about how they would be labelled being the Empire would classify them negatively regardless. He also held a strong, personal disdain for both slavery and indentured servitude, finding little difference between the two; this aversion was notable by a young Jyn Erso, believing that Saw had to have experienced a mission that made the topic a particularly sensitive topic.\n\nGerrera harbored great antipathy towards the Separatists for invading his homeworld Onderon. He also disliked the Geonosians due to their alignment with the Separatists and for building gunships which led to his sister Steela's death. This coupled by the loss of his comrades during a mission on Geonosis led him to brutally interrogate the Geonosian Klik-Klak, much to the discomfort of his former comrade Rex and the Spectres. Gerrera also disagreed with some of the Jedi's principled tactics, believing them lacking and costing them the Clone Wars.\n\nDespite his antipathy towards the Geonosians, Gerrera was horrified by the Empire's genocide against the species and believed that they had the same right to rebuild as other species. Gerrera's change of heart led him to release Klik-Klak and the Geonosian queen egg he was guarding. He also still retained greater level of respect for Jedi, acknowledging their help in the past even when wanting to dismiss them and offering Cal Kestis a place in his rebel group, acknowledging that a Jedi would aid the Partisans in their fight against the Empire. When Kestis refused because he had his own mission, Gerrera said the invitation was open, not giving up on the idea of having Kestis on the side of the Partisans. Gerrera would later enlist the help of Kestis on multiple occasions.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Early life and career[]\n\nSaw Gerrera was a human male who was born on the jungle planet Onderon during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Growing up within the walls of Onderon's capital city of Iziz as an Onderonian with his sister Steela Gerrera, Saw learned to greatly respect Onderon's monarch, longtime King Ramsis Dendup. In 24 BBY, thousands of star systems seceded from the Republic and formed their own galactic government, the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS). Within two years\u2014in 22 BBY\u2014the Republic and Confederacy broke into all-out war, the Clone Wars. King Dendup, wishing to keep his people out of the conflict, sided with neither the Republic and its newly-acquired Grand Army of clone troopers, nor the Confederacy.\n\nAfter the opening salvos of the Clone Wars were fired during the First Battle of Geonosis, the Clone War continued to sustain itself on battlefronts across the galaxy. At this time, at the behest of the Confederate Head of State Count Dooku of Serenno, the CIS instigated a coup that ousted Dendup from his royal throne and replaced with King Sanjay Rash, a \"puppet leader\" who answered directly to Count Dooku and cracked down on dissent. As ruler, Rash \"invited\" the Separatist Droid Army to Onderon\u2014but the act was actually an invasion of Saw's homeworld\u2014and subjected its citizens to Confederate law. Immediately after the planet joined the CIS, Saw\u2014who was deeply troubled for Onderon's future and undeterred that he and Steela had been banished from Iziz for openly defying King Rash\u2014and Steela began to gather resources and other like-minded individuals in the hopes of forming a resistance to fight against Rash and his battle droid forces.\n\nAt some stage, a young Gerrera found himself taken prisoner and forced into a rhydonium work camp in the hot Onderon jungles, where non-droid guards oversaw him and several hundred other young workers. The elder workers among them, meanwhile, had quickly died where they stood, leaving nothing but a few bones Gerrera and his fellow workers discovered the day after their deaths. Gerrera and his fellow younger workers found their clothing burning away and thus worked back and forth while naked. During one day, Gerrera, his fellow workers, and the guards all began to itch after a rhydonium leakage occurred, with the feeling seeping into their skin before the smell hit them. Gerrera found himself entranced by the new sensation and refused to run away, instead coming to love its smell and the itchy, burning feeling the substance gave. Whereas others would don a mask before working with rhydonium, Gerrera believed he understood the substance and thus did not require that gear.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Recovering Vak-Nhalis[]\n\nLater that year, Gerrera, who had been fed rumors by prisoners of war about Separatist caches, orchestrated and participated in hijacking a starship belonging to Old Krezchak, a pirate raiding Confederacy installations across eight sectors. Krezchak refused to negotiate or surrender his cargo, leading to his death. Encountering the Separatist operative Soujen Vak-Nhalis, Gerrera ordered him to stop and, when the man attempted to flee, shot him with a modified DC-15A blaster carbine that overloaded his cybernetics. Gerrera asked if Vak-Nhalis felt its effects, which he affirmed.\n\nThe Onderonian questioned whether Vak-Nhalis, who had just awoken from a hibernation pod, knew about the Empire, ascertaining that the stranger was calculating how to kill him. Expediting the conversation, Gerrera revealed that he was aware of the saboteur's history and offered to let Vak-Nhalis accompany him or go down with the ship; Vak-Nhalis accepted the former. Explaining that Krezchak intended to auction Vak-Nhalis on Kafrene, Gerrera observed that Vak-Nhalis did not ask many questions, comparing him to a battle droid. Descending into the hatch connecting Krezchak's ship to his own, the Dalgo, Vak-Nhalis attacked Gerrera, aiming for the other man's back as to break his spine. The cyborg's ambush failed, and he was incapacitated by an ion mine clamped to the bulkhead. As Vak-Nhalis passed out, Gerrera provided his name, declaring that the Separatist belonged in his grave.\n\nGathered in a cavern, Gerrera conversed with two of his soldiers, Karama and Vorgorath. Karama criticized Gerrera, suggesting targeted strikes against guard posts and clone troopers; Gerrera dismissed clones as a tool of the enemy that could be replaced,  desiring instead to make fighting the war against the Empire a battle of attrition. Vorgorath disparaged Karama's constant questioning, but Gerrera, noting the pair's accomplishments, found the questions inoffensive, extending the sentiment to include answering Vak-Nhalis' inquiries if he proved useful.\n\nGerrera introduced Vak-Nhalis to Nankry, another guerrilla, but the assassin declined to test her skills. Vak-Nhalis took one of Gerrera's ration packs, causing the man to laugh, who in turn allowed the Separatist to eat. Gerrera asked whether Vak-Nhalis had heard of him, to which he did not reply, and spoke about Onderon's history with the Republic and the government's transition into the Empire, Gerrera comparing the self-appointed Emperor Palpatine to his own world's tyrant, King Rash. Vak-Nhalis accused Gerrera of looking for an excuse to fight, but the insurgent charged the Empire with tightening its grip on Onderon, murdering the Jedi, and instigating the conflict.\n\nNankry came at Vak-Nhalis while he ate, causing a short scuffle. The other guerrillas rose to their feet, though Gerrera stood back. The scrap, resulting in a stalemate, ended when Gerrera told his fighters to stand down, indicating to Vak-Nhalis that the attack, although lethal, had been a test. Vak-Nhalis threatened Gerrera with death if it happened again, which he agreed was fair before requesting that they speak privately. Alone, Gerrera explained the need for supplies to fight the Empire to Vak-Nhalis, recounting the rumors that led him to the pirate ship that he had salvaged the assassin from. Gerrera deduced that the operative was himself a Separatist contingency, which Vak-Nhalis did not deny, before inquiring how much of him was machine or man and if he had been conscripted.\n\nVak-Nhalis stated that Gerrera wanted to control him, which the Onderonian admitted to if it was possible. Gerrera asked about Vak-Nhalis' orders, but the saboteur insisted he be direct. The revolutionary elaborated on his desire for provisions and resources beyond what Krezchak had envisioned. Vak-Nhalis posed if Gerrera's renegades wanted to fight the Republic; the Empire. Gerrera reasoned that the Empire wanted them all dead, so his troops would either learn to hit back or continue to suffer Empire's abuse. Gerrera offered to let Vak-Nhalis depart unhindered to hunt Separatists or Imperials or abandon the fight entirely, though Vak-Nhalis did not trust Gerrera would let him leave alive, or join Gerrera's own efforts and discover the funding of the cyborg's late investors. Vak-Nhalis chose to remain willingly. Gerrera laughed as he returned to the cave, though Vak-Nhalis did not join him, choosing to remain behind instead.\n\n",

In the facility known as Raven's Peak, Governor Tarkin headed a table of five highly ranked officers, including Doctor Royce Hemlock. Gerrera lead a small infiltration team into the facility, disguised as stormtroopers, with the intention of completely destroying the base. Armed with remote explosives, the team stealthily littered the lower levels with them. When they were almost finished, Gerrera ran into another group of intruders: Clone Force 99. Gerrera explained his plan to the clones, to which Hunter protested, as they had a separate goal to track Hemlock to the location of imprisoned clone troopers. Despite logical counterarguments made by Tech, Gerrera insisted it needed to be done \"for the greater good.\"\n\nBefore the two group's conversation could conclude, a security team interrupted, forcing them to part ways. With the imperials alerted to their presence, Gerrera order his comrades to retreat to an escape shuttle, although they had failed to place detonators in the command center. Most of his team fought their way to the shuttle and off-world, at which point Gerrera promptly detonated the explosives. While the explosion destroyed the hangar and much of the interior, the command tower was left undamaged. Unbeknownst to Gerrera, it had also caused a power outage to the facility's skyrail, which Clone Force 99 was using to escape. Ultimately, due to Gerrera's actions, Hemlock's tracked shuttle was destroyed and Tech was forced to sacrifice himself to allow his companions to escape.\n\nGerrera fought against the Imperial Military and reorganized the Onderon resistance into a group he dubbed the Partisans. Around 18 BBY, he hired a Lasat mercenary and fought an Imperial squad under ISB Agent Kallus when they were sent to Onderon to bring peace; the mercenary and other allied partisans killed Kallus' entire unit, save Kallus himself Gerrera ultimately came to think Onderon was lost and thus retreated from his own homeworld, however.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Helping hand from the Jedi[]\n\nApproximately two standard years later, in 20 BBY, Saw had become the self-proclaimed de facto leader of the Onderon rebels, and as a result of being banished from Iziz, the rebels took up residence in an abandoned outpost within a group of ancient ruins in Sector S-29 of the wilderness. Around this time, Lux Bonteri, the son of the late Mina Bonteri, the former senator of Onderon in the Republic's Galactic Senate joined Saw and his resistance. Having obtained enough armor, blasters, and various other small arms to supply their forces, Saw, Steela, and Bonteri plotted to take back Iziz for Onderon; the rebel leaders, however, after a number of small skirmishes with battle droid forces, came to the realization that they were both under-equipped and had neither the training nor skills to wage open war against the Confederacy. Therefore, Saw and Bonteri reached out to the Republic, requesting aid even though Gerrera had no personal loyalty to the Republic government: in his mind, a pact with the Republic was simply a way to ensure Onderon secured its freedom.\n\nUltimately, the esteemed Jedi High Council on the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, heard Saw and Bonteri's story via HoloNet transmission. Grand Master Yoda promised that the Jedi Order would find a way to aid them. A short time later, the freedom fighters were alerted to an intrusion in the jungle Sector S-11 and Steela led a squad to investigate. Shortly, Steela, mounted on a dalgo steed, returned with Yoda's promise: Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Togruta Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and 501st Legion clone trooper Rex. Saw, mounted on his reptavian ruping, welcomed the four Republic Military advisors to his world. Skywalker informed Saw that they couldn't fight the Onderonian Civil War for the resistance\u2014Onderon, after all, was legitimately aligned with the Confederacy, no matter how illegitimate Saw viewed the situation\u2014but he would train Saw's resistance to fight well on their own. While Gerrera and his comrades had wanted the Republic to be directly involved in their struggle, they still appreciated the aid and believed it to be a good deal.\n\nRex explained that, as a clone trooper, he would assist the Jedi Generals. After relocating a half-kilometer to a clearing in the jungle where a captured Separatist Armored Assault Tank was left dormant, Jedi Commander Tano and Clone Captain Rex instructed the freedom fighters on how to disable the tank: they had drop a pair of Electro Magnetic Pulse grenades\u2014\"droid poppers\"\u2014into both the tank's cockpits, one for the pilot and one for the gunner. Saw and Bonteri teamed for the exercise, but sharing in a tense rivalry, incidentally sabotaged one another by refusing to cooperate. Disgusted, Saw ridiculed Bonteri for being a \"terrible soldier,\" which disappointed the Jedi advisors. As the day wore on, Saw grew increasingly frustrated, berating Steela for regularly attending to Bonteri, with whom she shared a mutual attraction. As the confrontation between Saw and Bonteri almost came to blows, Steela defused the two men, explaining that there would be both a time for the direct fight that Saw desired, and the political speeches that Bonteri excelled at.\n\nThe rebels next returned to the encampment, where General Skywalker and Rex demonstrated how to most efficiently disable droideka security droids. Protected by a deflector shield, droidekas were immune to blaster bolts. Skywalker, thus, indicated that a slowly rolled droid popper was the best way to disable the droids. Confident in his abilities, Saw stepped up and attempted the technique first; however, he rolled the grenade too quickly and failed to penetrate the shield. Bonteri tried next and succeeded. Later, after many tries and much coaching from Tano, Saw managed to roll the grenade at the right speed and pierce the shield.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Jedi advisors moved on to coaching the rebels on how to properly utilize their blaster rifles. Steela, a sniper, impressed the Jedi with her skill. But while practicing, she was alerted to the fact that their encampment was under attack. Separatist B1-series battle droids and an Assault Tank pushed through the brush and opened fire on the rebels. Saw narrowly avoided being taken out by a missile blast from a B2-HA super battle droid, and advanced onto the frontline of the skirmish and returned fire. At a signal from the Jedi and Steela, Saw and other rebels heaved disruptor explosives into the path of the droids. Still outgunned, Steela loosed the dalgos, falumpasets, and tee-muss mammals, which stampeded and trampled the remaining droids. With only the armored tank remaining, Saw and Bonteri tried once more to disable the tank. On this attempt, however, the rebels worked together and succeeded in destroying the tank with a pair of thermal detonators. Elated in their first victory, Saw quipped that Bonteri looked more like a soldier than a politician, due to the grit that had come to cover him during the altercation. Knowing that their base location was compromised, the rebels and their advisors concocted a plan to infiltrate Iziz and pose as civilians in the hopes that they could wage the guerrilla war from within the capital.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Taking the fight to the Confederacy[]\n\nLater in the day, posing as hunters, the rebels and military advisors boarded a pair of dalgo-yoked Mandalorian transports and traveled to Iziz and fooled the \"dim-witted\" OOM command battle droid checkpoint in order to gain pass through the city's ray shielded main gate. The rebels then split up; Saw alerted other rebels already within the city that the time to fight had come, while Steela, Bonteri, Tano, and others went in search of new recruits.\n\nAs time went on, many more Onderonians enlisted with the independence fighters and they took shelter in a safe house deep in the city. Holding Iziz under siege from within, Saw, Bonteri, and Steela received regular intelligence and guidance from not only Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, and Rex, but the Jedi Masters on Coruscant as well. Saw and the rebels took as many chances as they could to disrupt battle droid patrols and destroy droids harassing Iziz civilians, engaging in as many as five engagements in a single day\u2014sometimes, even in high-traffic areas, such as Malgan Market. Saw often opened fire on Separatist minions publicly, which caused fear to mount in the civilian population, despite the fact that civilian casualties sat at zero.\n\nOne day, Saw and his resistance held a meeting in their Iziz safehouse, where Skywalker congratulated them on waging a thus-far successful campaign. Kenobi and Tano, however, believed that the public perception of Saw's rebels had not gone as planned; the people were growing ever more fearful of the sudden violence that had besieged their city. Saw, however, believed that the people were fearful simply because the droids were still active\u2014that he hadn't done enough to demobilize the Confederates. Steela and Bonteri added that they had to assure the general populace that the freedom fighters were just that: fighting for the freedom of the people. Steela believed the rebels had to win the hearts and minds of the people to gain their trust, something Saw did not understand. In order to prove to the civilians that the rebels could oust the Separatists, Bonteri proposed that they strike the Onderon power generator. In agreement, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Rex returned to the Core Worlds, having outfitted the rebels as planned.\n\nThe Jedi Knights pledged that they would continue to provide credits to the Saw's movement and also stationed Tano to remain on Onderon. At dusk, Saw, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela scouted out the power generator complex. Lying prone on a rooftop, Bonteri explained that if they could manage to disable the power compound it would cause a city-wide power outage, which, given time, would bring the Droid Army to a literal standstill: the droids operated independently of a control computer, but still had to recharge periodically using power cells. However, before assaulting the generators, the rebels concluded that they needed to know more about the compound. Saw took it upon himself to gather the desired intel: he quickly descended the building and brutishly ripped the head off of a patrolling \"clanker\" in the street and returned to the rooftop where a robolobotomy was performed using a Republic-provided device. From the holographic images provided from the cranial unit, Saw and the rebels came to the conclusion that any attack on the compound would be futile; the droids were too numerous. Bonteri, however, saw an opportunity and added that if they had enough firepower it could be done with a hijacked Separatist Assault Tank .\n\nIn order to secure the tank, the resistance concocted a ruse: on a nearby street, the rebel Dono detonated an EMP-loaded airspeeder in the path of droid Patrol 118, beginning the attack. Saw, utilizing droid poppers and a DC-15A blaster carbine, took down the entire patrol, with the exception of the commander droid. The rebels let the commander call for reinforcements, hoping that the Separatists would deliver aid in the form of an Assault Tank. First, however, a pair of droidekas were sent in. Outmatched from the front, Saw and Bonteri navigated behind the droidekas in a flanking maneuver.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The King's blessing[]\n\nShortly, Saw and the rebel leadership returned to their safehouse and were informed by trooper Dono that former King Dendup was scheduled to be executed by King Rash the next day in the central Yolahn Square. Steela surmised that Rash intended to kill his predecessor simply as an example to the rebels; to humiliate the freedom fighters and their cause. Tano reasoned that if Dendup was executed he would become a martyr and bolster the rebel cause. For his part, however, Saw ignored both the words of the war advisor and his sister and took it upon himself to rescue King Dendup before Rash even had a chance to publicly declare Dendup a traitor. Steela ordered Saw to stand down, but Saw, believing that his life was worth the risk of preserving Dendup's, covertly set out nonetheless, unaware that Steela had tasked Dono to tail him.\n\nAfter donning a cloak, Saw jogged to the foot of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square and scaled the multistory temple utilizing a grappling hook. Once atop the temple roof, Saw quickly spotted King Dendup in the temple courtyard and beheaded a nearby sentry droid while making his way to him. Saw bowed before his lord, swearing fealty to the former king and introduced himself, explaining to the king the execution situation. In angst, Dendup chastised Saw for \"interfering with the affairs of the throne\" by forming the resistance and confessed to Saw his failure as Saw's king: by not choosing to ally Onderon with either the Republic or the Confederacy during the Separatist Crisis, a side had been chosen for him; and as a result of Dendup's choice not to choose, the Onderonian Civil War had broken out, and Onderonians like Saw had stepped up to rectify his errs. Nonplussed, Saw encouraged Dendup, surprising the king with news that the rebels had the support of the Jedi Order. Greatly encouraged, Dendup agreed to escape with Saw, but when Saw fired his grappling hook to escape the royal prison courtyard, he was frustrated to find that it was blocked by a one-way shield, which alerted the Unifar Temple to the intrusion. As klaxons wailed and spotlights targeted, Saw and Dendup were taken into custody by a sextet of droidekas.\n\nSaw was transferred to the royal central command of the palace, where at Kalani and King Rash's order, Saw was cuffed and hung in a containment field and placed under interrogation by Kalani. General Akenathen Tandin of the Royal Onderon Militia supervised the investigation. Kalani tortured Saw for throughout the night but Saw the patriot of Onderon refused to divulge to the droid general any of of the rebel secrets. As a result, Kalani grew increasingly embittered, so he hiked up the dose of electric torture and the longevity of the doses; hoping Saw would break down. His body smoking from the electricity, Saw held to his beliefs and will and suffered the torture until Kalani and his EV-series medical droid heightened the electric shocks to great enough wattage to easily kill Saw. Saw hung while the torture took its toll not only on his body, but on his mind and spirit; Saw hardened himself and had begun on his irreversible path to becoming a remorseless soldier. Tandin, feeling sympathetic to his fellow Onderonian, commanded Kalani and his droids to give Saw rest. Kalani reluctantly agreed.\n\nShortly, Saw was given a drink of tea by Tandin, who questioned why Saw had chosen to rebel against Rash's throne, believing that Onderon's past under the rule of Ramsis Dendup was outdated, and the future was Onderon under Confederate rule. Saw explained that he chose to rebel because King Rash misused the power of the kingship to empower himself, rather than the people. Saw boomed over Tandin's arguments, proclaiming that he fought in Dendup's name for the former king had chosen to politically fight for the people, therefore not choosing to side with either the Republic or the Confederacy for his own gain as Rash so quickly had. Saw's words of patriotism weighed heavily on Tandin.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The perfect night[]\n\nBy 3 BBY, Gerrera's Partisans established a base of operations on D'Qar. That year, Rael put Wilmon Paak, an engineer belonging to Rael's Axis network, at Gerrera's disposal to manufacture a rhydonium mechanism. Paak presented the device to Gerrera who, admiring its loveliness, admitted it was a dream of his. Gerrera asked if it was \"healthy\" and had a full kit, which Paak confirmed, indicating its six gauges and eight variations.\n\nBecoming excited, Gerrera lauded the technology to his guerrillas as a galaxy of opportunities; rhydonium on demand\u2014what they wanted, when they wanted it. Gerrera asked Paak if the machine had been tested, to which he plainly stated that it worked. Demeanor shifting, Gerrera asked Paak who had taught him, leading Paak to question the inquiry in turn. Acknowledging rhydonium's high volatility and that few survived working with it, Gerrera reiterated his question. Paak replied that he was there to teach the variations and could not elaborate further.\n\nGerrera commended Paak's bravery, causing an eruption of laughter from the assembled Partisans, before asking if Paak had ever seen anyone die from rhydonium. Engaging in speculation, Gerrera wondered aloud if Paak, like himself, loved the smell of rhydonium; if inhaled too strongly, it would cause Paak's skin to blister as he combusted from the inside out. If Paak spilled it, cut a line, or dropped a wrench, Paak would ignite without a spark; immediate, explosive immolation.\n\nAsking Paak's name, Gerrera labeled him \"the Boy,\" inquiring if he had any actual experience. Paak admitted that he'd configured the device twice, though never alone. Observing that Paak was still alive, Gerrera summoned Pluti and instructed Paak to teach him the variations, starting with Paak's favorite. Paak alluded that it would be helpful to know what station the Partisans intended to hit, but Gerrera refused to disclose the information. Stressing that he needed to leave the next day, Paak was refuted by Gerrera, who altered the deal, promising to tell Rael that Paak was being cared for. Gerrera ordered that accommodations be made for Paak, who would stay as long as Gerrera had need of him.\n\nStudying under Paak, Pluti approached Gerrera with an understanding of the variations, though he desired more practice. Gerrera asked if they could lose Paak, who knew too much, confirming if Pluti was ready. Pluti defended Paak as a great engineer and asked what they would tell whoever sent him, but Gerrera dismissed Pluti, preferring to write Paak off as an accident. When Pluti expressed disappointment that Paak would not join them, Gerrera claimed he lacked confidence. Pluti, overwhelmed, pressed Gerrera for the information to focus on a single variations. Gerrera revealed that the attack would target the Station Four junction of Neen Valley's Markez Moon pipeline, occurring the next night. Specifying that Tubes had the pipe numbers, Gerrera opted to keep Paak around for a while longer.\n\nLater, Gerrera and Tubes approached Paak and Pluti. Gerrera asked Paak if Pluti could perform the operation independently, which Paak believed to be the case. Questioning his uncertainty, Gerrera raised a blaster to Paak's head, causing Paak to plead for his life. Gerrera instead executed Pluti, revealing him to be a traitor transmitting to the Empire. Having fed Pluti false information, Gerrera reassured the Partisans that they would not be caught in the ambush waiting for them on the Markez Moon, peacefully drinking rhydo parsecs away. Gerrera ordered the guerrillas to move quickly and burn what they did not take, as the Partisans would not be back to D'Qar.\n\nOnce the Partisans arrived at their actual target, Paak began calibrating the mechanism on a pipeline. As he waited, Gerrera began to tell a story from his younger days, reminiscing on his internment to a labour camp in the Onderonian jungle and the horrific conditions he faced, one of three hundred prisoners working in weather so hot they were forced to work naked. One day, everyone at the camp started to itch simultaneously, caused by a spillage of rhydonium that could be felt before being smelt.

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The King's blessing[]\n\nThe next day, Rash and Kalani, escorted by a quartet of IG-100 MagnaGuards, marched King Dendup and Saw in chains to the steps of the Unifar Temple overlooking Yolahn Square to their intended executions. Hundreds of Iziz citizens gathered to witness the proceedings and listened to Rash's speech, where he declared Dendup and Saw traitors deserving of death by beheading. Rash prepared his MagnaGuards and their electrostaffs to behead Dendup utilizing an electroguillotine. However, trooper Dono, having relayed to Steela and Bonteri that Saw had been arrested, put into motion a raid to free Dendup and Saw from the Separatists\u2014Bonteri tossed smoke bombs into the Separatist ranks, causing chaos while Steela and other soldiers extracted Saw and Dendup. Saw even managed to knock Kalani to the ground with his binders before the group began their withdrawal. The retreat was cut short, however, when B2 battle droid reinforcements surrounded Steela's extraction team and forced her troopers to surrender their weapons\u2014much to the dismay of the Onderonian citizens, who had come to see Saw's rebels as allies, and Rash's Separatists as intruding invaders. Having regained control of the function, Rash prepared to execute Dendup and Saw once more along with the newly incarcerated Steela.\n\nHaving surrendered to his fate, Saw thanked his sister for her attempt to save his life. General Tandin on the other hand, having heard the truth in Saw's words hours prior, decided not to surrender Saw and Dendup to the fate Rash intended for them. He then tore into the square with his Onderon guards and held King Rash and Kalani at laser lance point. Saw was touched and surprised that Tandin had abandoned King Rash's Royal Court, and sided with the Onderonian rebels. Tandin used Rash as a human shield and ordered the rebels to flee into the city, thanking Saw for helping him see that he had betrayed the true Onderon by serving King Rash. The Royal Militia followed Saw and the rebels to their safehouse while Tano helped Tandin escape Rash and his forces.\n\nSometime later, Tandin expressed to King Dendup that he had, thanks to well-expressed words from Saw, officially defected from the Separatist-led Onderon Royal Court and pledged himself and his army to Saw's rebels and Dendup. Dendup, like Steela, believed that to win the civil war, they had to win the minds of the people. Saw agreed, and made it his priority to protect Dendup from the Confederate strength of Count Dooku who no doubt wanted Dendup dead more than ever after the day's debacle.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Dealings with Axis[]\n\nAfter the raid on the Imperial garrison on Aldhani in 5 BBY, Luthen Rael traveled to Gerrera's base on Segra Milo and met with him. Getting down to business, Rael offered the freedom fighter the opportunity to trade several pieces of stolen Imperial technology, including a full set of Imperial drive adapters and three sealed Steergard targeting deflectors. After Rael confirmed that he had the items with him, Gerrera asked for him to set his price.\n\nTo Gerrera's surprise, Rael asked that he meet Anto Kreegyr, a contact who has been probing the Imperial power station at Spellhaus. Rael continued by saying that Kreegyr has found some weaknesses in the defense, but that he had an angle. Since Kreegyr was a Separatist, Gerrera dismissed Rael's offer, but Rael insisted that Gerrera hear Kreegyr out. As Gerrera was unwilling to work with Kreegyr, Rael stated that technology would come on the condition that he work with Kreegyr, warning him that he would go to someone else if he did not comply.\n\nGerrera insisted on working alone, but Rael asserted that that would have to change, telling Gerrera that they needed to work together to bring down the Empire. Gerrera persisted by saying that he was not a mercenary, but Rael asked him to imagine Spellhaus in flames. After listing a number of fallen rebel alliances, Gerrera asked what Rael was trying to accomplish. Rael responded by saying that he was a coward and was terrified that the Empire's power would grow beyond their means to stop it. He carried on by saying that they needed to put aside their differences, but Gerrera countered by claiming that he was the only one with clarity of purpose. Laughing, Rael stated that anarchy was a seductive concept for a man hiding in cold caves and begging for spare parts. Despite this, Gerrera refused to buy parts from Rael, telling him to find someone else to help Kreegyr.\n\nA little more than a month later, Gerrera had reconsidered his position and met with Rael a second time to join Kreegyr's attack on the Spellhaus power station. He told Rael that he would provide air power, but that aside from being told when it was needed he would be taking no tactical orders from Kreegyr and that his terms were non-negotiable. With the attack just a day away, Rael said he was too late. Since Gerrera would not back down so easily, Rael reluctantly explained that the ISB had learned of the imminent attack and would be waiting for the rebels on arrival at Spellhaus. Gerrera asked how Rael knew he would not warn Kreegyr, to which Rael replied that Gerrera was completely unpredictable. He continued by stating the decision to warn Kreegyr was now Gerrera's, but to consider the repercussions of both outcomes.\n\nDeducing that Rael must have an informant in the ISB, Gerrera began looking around his HQ, wondering if a spy was among his own ranks. Rael said that Gerrera was avoiding the matter at hand, but Gerrera demanded to know who the spy was. Rael claimed Benthic was his man who told him everything, to which Benthic stepped forward in protest. Rael swiftly took Benthic's blaster from his holster and pointed it at Gerrera to get him to listen. Rael elaborated on how the ISB would become arrogant after Kreegyr's downfall, giving them a \"clear field to play.\" He commented the alternative would lead to doubt and distrust in the ISB just as Gerrera is exhibiting now. Confirming a final time that thirty-one men would be sacrificed for this, Gerrera decided against warning Kreegyr for the sake of the war.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Helping hand from the Jedi[]\n\nShortly thereafter, the Jedi advisors moved on to coaching the rebels on how to properly utilize their blaster rifles. Steela, a sniper, impressed the Jedi with her skill. But while practicing, she was alerted to the fact that their encampment was under attack. Separatist B1-series battle droids and an Assault Tank pushed through the brush and opened fire on the rebels. Saw narrowly avoided being taken out by a missile blast from a B2-HA super battle droid, and advanced onto the frontline of the skirmish and returned fire. At a signal from the Jedi and Steela, Saw and other rebels heaved disruptor explosives into the path of the droids. Still outgunned, Steela loosed the dalgos, falumpasets, and tee-muss mammals, which stampeded and trampled the remaining droids. With only the armored tank remaining, Saw and Bonteri tried once more to disable the tank. On this attempt, however, the rebels worked together and succeeded in destroying the tank with a pair of thermal detonators. Elated in their first victory, Saw quipped that Bonteri looked more like a soldier than a politician, due to the grit that had come to cover him during the altercation. Knowing that their base location was compromised, the rebels and their advisors concocted a plan to infiltrate Iziz and pose as civilians in the hopes that they could wage the guerrilla war from within the capital.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Helping the Ersos[]\n\nSometime before 17 BBY, Gerrera joined an arms smuggling ring led by Has Obitt. The smugglers were to deliver arms to resistance fighters in the Salient system, however, this smuggling ring was the brainchild of Orson Krennic. Krennic was using small uprisings as an excuse to take control of planets heavy in resources needed to build the Death Star. Obitt had revealed this information to his smuggler partners, and they decided to double-cross the Empire. When they arrived at Salient, it became clear that the Empire was expecting to arrest Obitt and the other mercenaries. Gerrera convinced Obitt to stay and fight the Empire. The people of the Salient system eventually lost the battle and Obitt was captured and later released by Wilhuff Tarkin; Gerrera, however, was able to escape.\n\nIn 17 BBY, Obitt came in contact with Lyra Erso. Erso wanted to have her husband, Galen, to quit working with Krennic, and the only way to do so was for the family to flee Coruscant. Obitt, who had known the Ersos since Jyn's birth, knew Krennic would expect him to help the Ersos, so he asked Gerrera to go in his stead. Gerrera smuggled Lyra, Galen, and Jyn Erso off Coruscant and helped them set up a homestead on Lah'mu. The Ersos stayed vigilant while living on Lah'mu, forming an escape plan in case Krennic found them. The plan was for Lyra and Jyn Erso to hide in a shelter dug under a cave and to contact Gerrera for extraction.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The perfect night[]\n\nBy 3 BBY, Gerrera's Partisans established a base of operations on D'Qar. That year, Rael put Wilmon Paak, an engineer belonging to Rael's Axis network, at Gerrera's disposal to manufacture a rhydonium mechanism. Paak presented the device to Gerrera who, admiring its loveliness, admitted it was a dream of his. Gerrera asked if it was \"healthy\" and had a full kit, which Paak confirmed, indicating its six gauges and eight variations.\n\nBecoming excited, Gerrera lauded the technology to his guerrillas as a galaxy of opportunities; rhydonium on demand\u2014what they wanted, when they wanted it. Gerrera asked Paak if the machine had been tested, to which he plainly stated that it worked. Demeanor shifting, Gerrera asked Paak who had taught him, leading Paak to question the inquiry in turn. Acknowledging rhydonium's high volatility and that few survived working with it, Gerrera reiterated his question. Paak replied that he was there to teach the variations and could not elaborate further.\n\nGerrera commended Paak's bravery, causing an eruption of laughter from the assembled Partisans, before asking if Paak had ever seen anyone die from rhydonium. Engaging in speculation, Gerrera wondered aloud if Paak, like himself, loved the smell of rhydonium; if inhaled too strongly, it would cause Paak's skin to blister as he combusted from the inside out. If Paak spilled it, cut a line, or dropped a wrench, Paak would ignite without a spark; immediate, explosive immolation.\n\nAsking Paak's name, Gerrera labeled him \"the Boy,\" inquiring if he had any actual experience. Paak admitted that he'd configured the device twice, though never alone. Observing that Paak was still alive, Gerrera summoned Pluti and instructed Paak to teach him the variations, starting with Paak's favorite. Paak alluded that it would be helpful to know what station the Partisans intended to hit, but Gerrera refused to disclose the information. Stressing that he needed to leave the next day, Paak was refuted by Gerrera, who altered the deal, promising to tell Rael that Paak was being cared for. Gerrera ordered that accommodations be made for Paak, who would stay as long as Gerrera had need of him.\n\nStudying under Paak, Pluti approached Gerrera with an understanding of the variations, though he desired more practice. Gerrera asked if they could lose Paak, who knew too much, confirming if Pluti was ready. Pluti defended Paak as a great engineer and asked what they would tell whoever sent him, but Gerrera dismissed Pluti, preferring to write Paak off as an accident. When Pluti expressed disappointment that Paak would not join them, Gerrera claimed he lacked confidence. Pluti, overwhelmed, pressed Gerrera for the information to focus on a single variations. Gerrera revealed that the attack would target the Station Four junction of Neen Valley's Markez Moon pipeline, occurring the next night. Specifying that Tubes had the pipe numbers, Gerrera opted to keep Paak around for a while longer.\n\nLater, Gerrera and Tubes approached Paak and Pluti. Gerrera asked Paak if Pluti could perform the operation independently, which Paak believed to be the case. Questioning his uncertainty, Gerrera raised a blaster to Paak's head, causing Paak to plead for his life. Gerrera instead executed Pluti, revealing him to be a traitor transmitting to the Empire. Having fed Pluti false information, Gerrera reassured the Partisans that they would not be caught in the ambush waiting for them on the Markez Moon, peacefully drinking rhydo parsecs away. Gerrera ordered the guerrillas to move quickly and burn what they did not take, as the Partisans would not be back to D'Qar.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The true cost of conflict[]\n\nThe war raged on and the resistance eventually moved their headquarters from the urban population of Iziz to the remote eastern mountain range known as the Onderon highlands, where, back in the jungle, Saw was reunited with his team. At the highlands, Saw and the rebels constructed a new base, known as \"the nest;\" named for the rupings who used the highlands as a nesting ground. During this time, Padawan Tano and Bonteri enacted a quick mission back to Iziz where they utilized a holographic message of King-in-exile Dendup declared his allegiance to the Onderon rebels, whom he called patriots of true Onderon. Upon their return, Bonteri informed Saw that the civilians had taken to the Iziz streets to riot as a result of hearing Dendup's message. Encouraged, Saw voiced his desire to join the civilians and take the fight straight to Rash in the streets of Iziz, but Steela, Tano, Tandin, and King Dendup, all disagreed\u2014they believed the rebels needed to avoid civilian casualties at all costs, thus the Confederate forces had to be drawn out of the crowded city and into the wilderness of the highlands.\n\nIt wasn't long before Kalani located the rebels in the highlands and sent his army out to confront them. Meanwhile, the rebels and Royal bodyguards dug into the jungle mesas and prepared to repel the droid infantry. Once the battle of the Onderonian highlands began, Saw led a group of ruping riders, providing air support for the dalgo-mounted cavalry commanded by Tandin. The Confederate forces were caught off-guard by the rebels attack and were mostly destroyed by the rebels diverse forces of rupings, cavalry, snipers, and blaster cannons mounted on towering fambaas. Saw and his riders swept over the battlefront, destroying the droid's support vehicles with grenades. However, before the skirmish could be won, three HMP droid gunships entered the fray and systematically turned the tide of battle by killing much of Tandin's cavalry and fambaas. Saw's ruping riders were downed by two, and Saw was forced to hide from the droid fighters and recollect himself. Seizing the next opportunity, Saw bore his ruping towards a distracted gunship and lobbed a detonator at the hovering droid. However, the detonator did no damage to the craft as it was heavily ray shielded. The gunship next targeted Saw, and it managed to kill his ruping, throwing Saw to the ground. With the battle's tide having turned, Tandin's cavalry retreated, and the Royal General hoisted Saw atop his dalgo as the surviving rebel forces retreated back to the nest in complete disarray.\n\nAt the nest, the Gerreras, Tandin, Tano, and Bonteri convened to strategize. Tano explained that she had contacted her Jedi superiors Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and requested aid from the Jedi Council, but he wasn't sure he would be able to help the rebels. Refusing to be discouraged, Steela pointed out that since the droid could not be stopped before reaching the nest, the fort had to be fortified for the incoming invasion. Emboldened by her spirit, Saw expressed how proud he was of his sister. She accredited her skills as a leader to watching Saw. Saw returned to organize the defense at the battlefront a short distance from the nest, and shortly, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela arrived bearing new armaments provided by Skywalker and Kenobi through the Weequay Hondo Ohnaka, the pirate lord of the Ohnaka Gang: Sienar Fleet Systems RPS-6 rocket launchers. Saw immediately took one of the rocket launchers and fired a missile at a nearby gunship. The droid ship was brought down by the single shot; revitalizing the rebels' resolve to fight now that they had a weapon that could deal damage. The launchers were being distributed among the insurgents, when word came that the nest had been found and was under attack by the remaining gunships.\n\nSteela hurriedly took the rupings with her troops and headed the short distance back atop the mesas where the fort was located in order to protect King Dendup. Saw, meanwhile, with a pair of soldiers, supported Steela by distracting the gunships. Within minutes, only one gunship remained, and Saw took aim with his launcher and shot down the final droid ship. The mortally damaged ship careened through the sky and smashed into a cliff face where Steela was protecting Dendup from several commando droids. The weakened cliff face gave way, and Saw was horrified to see that Steela had fallen with it, and was hanging from the cliff edge. Tano began using the Force to lift Steela to safety, but the droid gunship remained partially active, and it fired on Tano, striking her in the shoulder with a bolt. Tano's wound disrupted her concentration long enough for her telekinetic hold on Steela to be severed. Saw ran in horror to his fallen sister as she fell to her death on the rocks below. As Saw cradled Steela's lifeless body, he recounted the fact that it had been he who had shot down the gunship. Saw was racked with a guilt; a guilt he would never banish from his mind.\n\nThe rebels emerged victorious over the Separatists in the highlands, and the Confederate defeat prompted Dooku to withdraw Kalani and his forces from Onderon and move to the planet Agamar due to the apparent long-term conflict the rebels intended to fight. And later in the day, the rebels returned to Iziz, where Dendup was reinstated as King\u2014Sanjay Rash having been assassinated by Kalani on Dooku's orders after the Confederate defeat in the highlands. Later, a funeral was held for Steela on the steps of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square. Thousands of Onderonians turned up for the funeral in mourning over Steela's untimely death. Saw paid his respects over his sister's sarcophagus and rejected Tano and Bonteri's condolences, angry he couldn't prevent Steela's death. Full of guilt and brokenhearted, Gerrera made it his mission to continue his battle against all forms of what he considered evil.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Jalindi and a personal quest[]\n\nIn 1 BBY, Saw was first mentioned by Bail Organa, where he gave information that was supplied by Saw; primarily, a new relay being used by the Empire. When the Rebellion wanted to tap into the relay to learn what the Empire was doing, Saw, who had sent an astromech, appeared and stated that they were cowards, as they were not doing what it would take to win. After Mon Mothma cut off communications with him, Saw prepared to head to the relay to destroy it. He arrived on his U-Wing with the help of his pilot, Edrio. Upon opening the doors to drop bombs, he was surprised to see Ezra and Sabine, greeting the two while tossing out three packs of proton bombs onto the relay. Telling them that the bombs would detonate soon, he let them board his starfighter and proceeded to fly out of the area just as the bombs exploded, destroying the relay and killing Brom Titus.\n\nOutside in Jalindi's space, Hera contacted him and told him to return Ezra and Sabine. Saw agreed and prepared the process; however, a Star Destroyer suddenly appeared, forcing Saw to leave for Faos Station with them. During the trip, Saw told the two that he needed their help as, after the events on Geonosis, he still did not know what the Empire was building. Upon arriving at Faos Station, he, Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper boarded Freighter 2716.\n\nUpon investigating the materials, which were used for the construction of Star Destroyers, Saw claimed that the Empire was up to something. Continuing his investigation, they found Imperial stormtroopers on the ship and learned that the freighter was heading towards the remote Tonnis sector, cementing Saw's suspicions. When Chopper told him that hold 12 contained an Imperial shuttle, they went in and found prisoners, who were either power or reactor technicians. Later on when Ezra kept hearing \"singing,\" Chopper revealed that hold 17 was a restricted area. Upon opening the door to that hold, they encountered a death trooper, prompting Saw to fire at point-blank range, killing the trooper. Sabine tossed several smoke grenades into the room, which Saw used to blend in and take down several troopers.\n\nAfter clearing the area, one of the troopers managed to escape. Saw wanted to go after her, but Sabine told him not to. They inspected the mysterious cargo the troopers were protecting and realized that it was an unusually large kyber crystal. Saw, adamant in finding out what the Empire was building, reluctantly stayed to guard the crystal while Ezra and Sabine went to sabotage the hyperspace drive. However, he quickly betrayed them and stunned the two in the engine room.\n\nWhen Ezra and Sabine woke up, they asked Saw why he betrayed them. Saw stated that they were very close to finding out the secret weapon and told them to look on the screen. When the freighter arrived at the Tonnis sector, they only saw a single Star Destroyer. Confused, but still convinced of the Empire's nefarious designs with the crystal, he used Ezra's lightsaber to destroy the freighter's hyperdrive before firing onto the crystal's mounting, effectively turning the crystal into a time bomb. He then freed the two, while Edrio, who had tailed the freighter, informed Saw that he was outside. Knowing that Ezra and Sabine no longer agreed with his methods, Saw bid farewell to them while they made their individual escapes before the freighter and Star Destroyer were obliterated.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Strained relationships[]\n\nGerrera's aggressive tactics including the killing of prisoners, civilians and violations of the rules of engagement created strife with members of the Rebel Alliance, whom Saw equally regarded as a source of frustration due to their focus on how the Galactic Empire would labels them and disliked their views on prioritizing while simultaneously enlisting his aid for more controversial missions. Mutually, the Rebel Alliance believed Gerrera's actions hurts them more than helps them and opined that his fatal flaw being that as a leader, Saw lacks the understanding of people valuing peace and order more than freedom and that his actions raises alarming concerns that the Rebel Alliance will replace the order the Galactic Empire represents with chaos and danger.\n\nChief among his strife with the leaders included Mon Mothma; he regarded her as weak and indecisive, though he did see fire in her, while Mothma regarded him as a war criminal and terrorist mired in cynicism. Gerrera also saw potential in Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper as effective soldiers for a mission to discover the Empire's secret superweapon. However, Gerrera's willingness to risk the lives of civilians in this quest strained his partnership with Ezra and Sabine. Ezra, who initially admired Gerrera's ability to acquire intelligence, became disillusioned with his ruthless and aggressive tactics. Gerrera believed that if a planet was lost, then there was no other option but to leave, which put him at odds with fellow Partisan Mari Kosan, who chose to stay with the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.\n\nGerrera became a mentor to Jyn Erso after she lost her parents to the Empire. Saw referred to Jyn as his daughter and taught her how to defend herself and gave her a datapad to teach herself more traditional subjects such as maths. Though Jyn ended up going on missions by the time she was fourteen, Saw was more hesitant to put her in danger and went out of his way to hide her true identity from others, including giving her a green scarf to cover up her mother's pendant. He abandoned her at the age of sixteen in order to protect her from other rebels who wanted to use her as a hostage due to her status as Galen Erso's daughter. Gerrera initially did not believe the Imperial defector Bodhi Rook's report that the Empire was building a new superweapon called the Death Star and had him tortured with a Bor Gullet. Despite his estranged relationship with Jyn, Gerrera was still able to inspire her to find the weakness in the Empire's superweapon in order to save the rebellion. Gerrera was unafraid of death and stayed behind when the Empire destroyed the Jedha Holy City.\n\nGerrera fought alongside Lux Bonteri to free their home planet of Onderon however the two often argued as Saw viewed Bonteri as more of a politician than a fighter with Saw's sister Steela working as a mediator between the two. Both where deeply saddened by her death. Following the rise of the Empire, Bonteri joined the Rebel Alliance instead of Gerrera's Partisans, which his goddaughter Maia did join. After Gerrera's death, Bonteri contacted his stepdaughter, a clerical worker loyal to the Empire, saying Gerrera's death had upset him more than he could have realized and for amnesty in exchange for surrendering to the Empire and disclosing all his information on the Rebel Alliance and their operations. She gave him a list of specific times and locations where he could turn himself in. Bonteri, however, instead used the locations to give Staven, the leader of the Dreamers, a group consisting of surviving Partisans, a supply of targets to hit.\n\nRuthless though he was, Gerrera carried several regrets throughout his life. He felt responsible for the death of his sister, Steela. Thus, he vowed to keep up his war against what he saw as evil, no matter what form his enemies took. Despite justifying his reasons for doing so, he deeply regretted abandoning Jyn Erso and leaving her on her own.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Taking the fight to Jedha[]\n\nWith his campaigns against the Empire becoming increasingly brutal, Alliance High Command, at the urging of Mon Mothma, formally censured Gerrera and severed all official ties with the Partisans. By this time, Gerrera had lost his right leg and struggled to walk on a low-grade cybernetic replacement. Additionally, years spent huffing rhydonium fumes had scarred his lungs, confining him to a pressurized armor suit and requiring him to regularly take supplementary oxygen from a breath mask.\n\nHaving previously learned that the Empire's massive kyber crystal had come from Jedha, Gerrera relocated his militia to the moon, feeling that it was an appropriate place to bring his rebellion, as it was a sacred world to many different galactic religions. Due to the Imperials defiling many religious temples and artifacts in their pursuit of kyber crystals, small, local insurgent cells had begun forming in the Holy City of NiJedha in opposition to the occupation. From his new base of operations in the Catacombs of Cadera, just a half-day's walk outside the Holy City, Gerrera began recruiting and organizing the local insurgencies under the umbrella of his Partisans. During this time, he also held command over a pair of UT-60D U-wing troop transports and six T-65 X-wing fighters. Calling them the Cavern Angels, Gerrera began deploying this squadron in hit-and-run air raids against Imperial facilities in the Holy City, as well as the outlying, Imperial-controlled kyber mines.\n\nAmong the local insurgents Gerrera recruited were Guardians of the Whills Chirrut \u00cemwe and Baze Malbus, whom he enticed into joining by providing much needed provisions for the orphanage run by \u00cemwe and Malbus's friends, Kaya and Killi Gimm. Over several months, the Partisans attacked the Imperial occupiers, leading to harsher and harsher reprisals from the Empire. The Star Destroyer that had previously orbited high over Jedha descended to rest right above the Holy City, and the number of stormtroopers, tanks, and walkers on patrol in the streets increased significantly. \u00cemwe and Malbus came to Gerrera asking for assistance stealing a spacecraft so the Gimm sisters could flee the planet with their orphans. A group of Partisans, led by Beezer Fortuna, helped \u00cemwe and Malbus steal a Sentinel-class shuttle. Under the orders of Gerrera, Fortuna and the other Partisans attempted to double-cross \u00cemwe and Malbus, wishing to use the shuttle to blow up the Star Destroyer over the city. \u00cemwe and Malbus were able to talk the Partisans out of taking the shuttle, allowing the orphans to escape Jedha. However, this led to Gerrera parting ways with \u00cemwe and Malbus.\n\n",

Casterfo cited Saw's actions among others as evidence of the Alliance's alleged atrocities during a political discussion with the Populist senior senator Leia Organa, rebutting that the Alliance did what they thought was necessary and reminded the Empire employed far more brutal tactics and the stakes being too high.  While reviewing past reports of the Rebel Alliance during her time in the Resistance, Organa also recalled the reveal of the Death Star to be a cumulation of Saw's crusade and acknowledged the Alliance taking his efforts for granted until it was too late.\n\n",

A compassionate and charismatic man, Saw valued freedom, independence, and was a loyal follower of King Ramsis Dendup willing to fight for causes supporting them. The death of his sister, Steela, had a profound effect on Saw, sowing the seeds for the darker methods he would take up later in his lifetime.\n\nInitially, Gerrera did not understand the idea of fighting in a manner in which wins the support of people around them, a flaw in which left him dishearten for a time when his fellow rebels showcased his sister's methods as being more popular among them. Sometime after his sister's death, he'd garnered a more positive reputation, regarded as a effective soldier trained by General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex and a Onderonian planetary hero and was briefly considered a candidate for Govenor by the Galactic Empire. Although his methods were beginning to bordering extreme, Mothma noted upon meeting him for the first time, he moved with confidence akin to a chancellor or a judge and noted when accused of having no strategy by Organa, he revealed himself to be pragmatic, clever, and more concerned for public opinion than he let on, having grand plans, ambitions, and capable of working with criminal elements to achieve his goals although limited to a single-sector conflict. Fitting this image, he practiced giving speeches to inspire others to his cause.\n\nHowever, through a combinations of his own actions as well as both accounts of the Empire and from allies alike, be it true or falsified by both (the latter in other to give plausible deniability), Gerrera's image eroded overtime and leaned more into extremism. Much later in his life, only occasional flashes of his charismatic and caring attitude shined through his callous exterior.\n\n",

Believing the Empire's existence to pose a threat to all they had fought for during the Clone Wars, Gerrera and his militia began pushing back against the Empire, drawing the attention of Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin. In response, Tarkin deployed experimental Clone Force 99 to deal with Gerrera's faction, though also as a test of Clone Force 99's loyalty. Upon arriving and seeing Gerrera's group, the squad refused to execute their orders, save for Crosshair, who insisted on fulfilling the mission. Gerrera and his men apprehended the squad of clones, but soon released them, giving Hunter, the squad's leader, a chance to pick a side. Gerrera then left with his militia, leaving the squad of clones alone. Later, a new squadron led by Crosshair, who had left the Clone Force 99 due to their defection from the Empire, arrived to finish the mission to eliminate Saw and his militia. However, Saw was already gone, and the only ones left were some militia members and some civilians. All were killed, including the Elite Squad Trooper ES-01, who refused to eliminate the civilians, causing him to be executed for treason by Crosshair.\n\n",

He and his sister, Steela Gerrera, were instrumental in the rebel liberation of their homeworld during the Onderonian Civil War. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire at the end of the war, Saw became a key member in the fight against the fascist government and the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. His tactics during the early rebellion against the Empire led him to be seen as an extremist, one whose notoriety was recognized by both the Empire, the Alliance, and, many years later, the New Republic.\n\nIn the early resistance against the Separatist Alliance on Onderon, Gerrera and his fellow soldiers were outnumbered and outgunned by the Separatist Droid Army. They requested help from the Jedi High Council, which led the Grand Army of Republic in its fight against the Separatists, but the Jedi Order chose not to become actively involved in the fighting on Onderon. Instead, they sent a team of advisors\u2014Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Commander Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain Rex\u2014to train the Onderonian fighters. The Jedi and Captain Rex taught them proper techniques and strategies for taking on the battle droid army, and, through their efforts, the rebels began to turn the tide. Gerrera came to resent that the rebels chose Steela as their leader, and he was soon captured in an ill-concocted solo effort to rescue the deposed King Ramsis Dendup from the Separatists. They were both rescued by the rebels, who eventually mounted a final battle against the Separatists. Through their efforts, the rebels liberated their world and returned Dendup to the throne. The fight, however, came at a personal cost: Steela was killed during the final battle, and Gerrera was left to mourn his sister\u2014feeling responsible for her death.\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire. Horrified, Gerrera and his fellow Onderonians resisted the Empire, and the Empire, despite the fact that Saw and his team had been instrumental in the liberation of Onderon, branded them as insurgents. Gerrera managed to evade Imperial capture, and he continued to fight against the Empire. During this time, Saw relocated Imperial scientist Galen Erso, his wife, Lyra, and their daughter, Jyn, to the uninhabited planet of Lah'mu. When Orson Krennic, an old friend of Galen's, discovered their location and took Galen away and killed Lyra, Saw traveled to Lah'mu, adopted Jyn, and raised her, all the while claiming that she was his own daughter.\n\nGerrera fought against the Imperial Military and led a resistance group known as the Partisans, a militant organization that some considered an extremist organization, using terrorist tactics and operating under the codename, \"Stoneface.\" His resistance cell, a continuation of his Onderonian resistance, was one of the first in the group of cells that formed the Rebel Alliance. He was later involved in the early campaigns of the Rebel Alliance, by which time his more-extreme tactics had come to stand in stark contrast with those of Alliance leaders Bail Organa and Mon Mothma. Gerrera eventually cut ties with Organa and Mothma, who viewed him as a militant and extremist.\n\nHaving learned that the Empire's massive kyber crystal had come from Jedha, Saw and the Partisans based their operation there. After the capture of an Imperial ensign, Bodhi Rook, who claimed that the Empire was building a planet-killer, Saw was reunited with Jyn, whom the Alliance had sent to meet with him. Since Rook had sent him a message from Jyn's father, Gerrera showed it to her, which revealed that the Empire was constructing a planet-killing superweapon called the Death Star. As the message played, however, the Death Star struck Jedha City and destroyed it. As the ripple of the explosion reached them, Gerrera told Jyn he was done running and stayed at the base, and was killed by the aftermath of the blast.\n\n",

Getting down to business, Rael offered the freedom fighter the opportunity to trade several pieces of stolen Imperial technology, including a full set of Imperial drive adapters and three sealed Steergard targeting deflectors. After Rael confirmed that he had the items with him, Gerrera asked for him to set his price.\n\nTo Gerrera's surprise, Rael asked that he meet Anto Kreegyr, a contact who has been probing the Imperial power station at Spellhaus. Rael continued by saying that Kreegyr has found some weaknesses in the defense, but that he had an angle. Since Kreegyr was a Separatist, Gerrera dismissed Rael's offer, but Rael insisted that Gerrera hear Kreegyr out. As Gerrera was unwilling to work with Kreegyr, Rael stated that technology would come on the condition that he work with Kreegyr, warning him that he would go to someone else if he did not comply.\n\nGerrera insisted on working alone, but Rael asserted that that would have to change, telling Gerrera that they needed to work together to bring down the Empire. Gerrera persisted by saying that he was not a mercenary, but Rael asked him to imagine Spellhaus in flames. After listing a number of fallen rebel alliances, Gerrera asked what Rael was trying to accomplish. Rael responded by saying that he was a coward and was terrified that the Empire's power would grow beyond their means to stop it. He carried on by saying that they needed to put aside their differences, but Gerrera countered by claiming that he was the only one with clarity of purpose. Laughing, Rael stated that anarchy was a seductive concept for a man hiding in cold caves and begging for spare parts. Despite this, Gerrera refused to buy parts from Rael, telling him to find someone else to help Kreegyr.\n\nA little more than a month later, Gerrera had reconsidered his position and met with Rael a second time to join Kreegyr's attack on the Spellhaus power station. He told Rael that he would provide air power, but that aside from being told when it was needed he would be taking no tactical orders from Kreegyr and that his terms were non-negotiable. With the attack just a day away, Rael said he was too late. Since Gerrera would not back down so easily, Rael reluctantly explained that the ISB had learned of the imminent attack and would be waiting for the rebels on arrival at Spellhaus. Gerrera asked how Rael knew he would not warn Kreegyr, to which Rael replied that Gerrera was completely unpredictable. He continued by stating the decision to warn Kreegyr was now Gerrera's, but to consider the repercussions of both outcomes.\n\nDeducing that Rael must have an informant in the ISB, Gerrera began looking around his HQ, wondering if a spy was among his own ranks. Rael said that Gerrera was avoiding the matter at hand, but Gerrera demanded to know who the spy was. Rael claimed Benthic was his man who told him everything, to which Benthic stepped forward in protest. Rael swiftly took Benthic's blaster from his holster and pointed it at Gerrera to get him to listen. Rael elaborated on how the ISB would become arrogant after Kreegyr's downfall, giving them a \"clear field to play.\" He commented the alternative would lead to doubt and distrust in the ISB just as Gerrera is exhibiting now. Confirming a final time that thirty-one men would be sacrificed for this, Gerrera decided against warning Kreegyr for the sake of the war.\n\n",

Steela, a sniper, impressed the Jedi with her skill. But while practicing, she was alerted to the fact that their encampment was under attack. Separatist B1-series battle droids and an Assault Tank pushed through the brush and opened fire on the rebels. Saw narrowly avoided being taken out by a missile blast from a B2-HA super battle droid, and advanced onto the frontline of the skirmish and returned fire. At a signal from the Jedi and Steela, Saw and other rebels heaved disruptor explosives into the path of the droids. Still outgunned, Steela loosed the dalgos, falumpasets, and tee-muss mammals, which stampeded and trampled the remaining droids. With only the armored tank remaining, Saw and Bonteri tried once more to disable the tank. On this attempt, however, the rebels worked together and succeeded in destroying the tank with a pair of thermal detonators. Elated in their first victory, Saw quipped that Bonteri looked more like a soldier than a politician, due to the grit that had come to cover him during the altercation. Knowing that their base location was compromised, the rebels and their advisors concocted a plan to infiltrate Iziz and pose as civilians in the hopes that they could wage the guerrilla war from within the capital.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The true cost of conflict[]\n\nThe war raged on and the resistance eventually moved their headquarters from the urban population of Iziz to the remote eastern mountain range known as the Onderon highlands, where, back in the jungle, Saw was reunited with his team. At the highlands, Saw and the rebels constructed a new base, known as \"the nest;\" named for the rupings who used the highlands as a nesting ground. During this time, Padawan Tano and Bonteri enacted a quick mission back to Iziz where they utilized a holographic message of King-in-exile Dendup declared his allegiance to the Onderon rebels, whom he called patriots of true Onderon. Upon their return, Bonteri informed Saw that the civilians had taken to the Iziz streets to riot as a result of hearing Dendup's message. Encouraged, Saw voiced his desire to join the civilians and take the fight straight to Rash in the streets of Iziz, but Steela, Tano, Tandin, and King Dendup, all disagreed\u2014they believed the rebels needed to avoid civilian casualties at all costs, thus the Confederate forces had to be drawn out of the crowded city and into the wilderness of the highlands.\n\nIt wasn't long before Kalani located the rebels in the highlands and sent his army out to confront them. Meanwhile, the rebels and Royal bodyguards dug into the jungle mesas and prepared to repel the droid infantry. Once the battle of the Onderonian highlands began, Saw led a group of ruping riders, providing air support for the dalgo-mounted cavalry commanded by Tandin. The Confederate forces were caught off-guard by the rebels attack and were mostly destroyed by the rebels diverse forces of rupings, cavalry, snipers, and blaster cannons mounted on towering fambaas. Saw and his riders swept over the battlefront, destroying the droid's support vehicles with grenades. However, before the skirmish could be won, three HMP droid gunships entered the fray and systematically turned the tide of battle by killing much of Tandin's cavalry and fambaas. Saw's ruping riders were downed by two, and Saw was forced to hide from the droid fighters and recollect himself. Seizing the next opportunity, Saw bore his ruping towards a distracted gunship and lobbed a detonator at the hovering droid. However, the detonator did no damage to the craft as it was heavily ray shielded. The gunship next targeted Saw, and it managed to kill his ruping, throwing Saw to the ground. With the battle's tide having turned, Tandin's cavalry retreated, and the Royal General hoisted Saw atop his dalgo as the surviving rebel forces retreated back to the nest in complete disarray.\n\nAt the nest, the Gerreras, Tandin, Tano, and Bonteri convened to strategize. Tano explained that she had contacted her Jedi superiors Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and requested aid from the Jedi Council, but he wasn't sure he would be able to help the rebels. Refusing to be discouraged, Steela pointed out that since the droid could not be stopped before reaching the nest, the fort had to be fortified for the incoming invasion. Emboldened by her spirit, Saw expressed how proud he was of his sister. She accredited her skills as a leader to watching Saw. Saw returned to organize the defense at the battlefront a short distance from the nest, and shortly, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela arrived bearing new armaments provided by Skywalker and Kenobi through the Weequay Hondo Ohnaka, the pirate lord of the Ohnaka Gang: Sienar Fleet Systems RPS-6 rocket launchers. Saw immediately took one of the rocket launchers and fired a missile at a nearby gunship. The droid ship was brought down by the single shot; revitalizing the rebels' resolve to fight now that they had a weapon that could deal damage. The launchers were being distributed among the insurgents, when word came that the nest had been found and was under attack by the remaining gunships.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Helping hand from the Jedi[]\n\nApproximately two standard years later, in 20 BBY, Saw had become the self-proclaimed de facto leader of the Onderon rebels, and as a result of being banished from Iziz, the rebels took up residence in an abandoned outpost within a group of ancient ruins in Sector S-29 of the wilderness. Around this time, Lux Bonteri, the son of the late Mina Bonteri, the former senator of Onderon in the Republic's Galactic Senate joined Saw and his resistance. Having obtained enough armor, blasters, and various other small arms to supply their forces, Saw, Steela, and Bonteri plotted to take back Iziz for Onderon; the rebel leaders, however, after a number of small skirmishes with battle droid forces, came to the realization that they were both under-equipped and had neither the training nor skills to wage open war against the Confederacy. Therefore, Saw and Bonteri reached out to the Republic, requesting aid even though Gerrera had no personal loyalty to the Republic government: in his mind, a pact with the Republic was simply a way to ensure Onderon secured its freedom.\n\nUltimately, the esteemed Jedi High Council on the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, heard Saw and Bonteri's story via HoloNet transmission. Grand Master Yoda promised that the Jedi Order would find a way to aid them. A short time later, the freedom fighters were alerted to an intrusion in the jungle Sector S-11 and Steela led a squad to investigate. Shortly, Steela, mounted on a dalgo steed, returned with Yoda's promise: Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Togruta Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and 501st Legion clone trooper Rex. Saw, mounted on his reptavian ruping, welcomed the four Republic Military advisors to his world. Skywalker informed Saw that they couldn't fight the Onderonian Civil War for the resistance\u2014Onderon, after all, was legitimately aligned with the Confederacy, no matter how illegitimate Saw viewed the situation\u2014but he would train Saw's resistance to fight well on their own. While Gerrera and his comrades had wanted the Republic to be directly involved in their struggle, they still appreciated the aid and believed it to be a good deal.\n\nRex explained that, as a clone trooper, he would assist the Jedi Generals. After relocating a half-kilometer to a clearing in the jungle where a captured Separatist Armored Assault Tank was left dormant, Jedi Commander Tano and Clone Captain Rex instructed the freedom fighters on how to disable the tank: they had drop a pair of Electro Magnetic Pulse grenades\u2014\"droid poppers\"\u2014into both the tank's cockpits, one for the pilot and one for the gunner. Saw and Bonteri teamed for the exercise, but sharing in a tense rivalry, incidentally sabotaged one another by refusing to cooperate. Disgusted, Saw ridiculed Bonteri for being a \"terrible soldier,\" which disappointed the Jedi advisors. As the day wore on, Saw grew increasingly frustrated, berating Steela for regularly attending to Bonteri, with whom she shared a mutual attraction. As the confrontation between Saw and Bonteri almost came to blows, Steela defused the two men, explaining that there would be both a time for the direct fight that Saw desired, and the political speeches that Bonteri excelled at.\n\nThe rebels next returned to the encampment, where General Skywalker and Rex demonstrated how to most efficiently disable droideka security droids. Protected by a deflector shield, droidekas were immune to blaster bolts. Skywalker, thus, indicated that a slowly rolled droid popper was the best way to disable the droids. Confident in his abilities, Saw stepped up and attempted the technique first; however, he rolled the grenade too quickly and failed to penetrate the shield. Bonteri tried next and succeeded. Later, after many tries and much coaching from Tano, Saw managed to roll the grenade at the right speed and pierce the shield.",

The Onderon resistance continued fighting as recognized Republic fighters, taking full advantage of the weaponry and equipment supplied to their movement. During the Outer Rim Sieges and the closing days of the Clone Wars, Gerrera, who had begun to use Anakin Skywalker's subspace frequency \"Fulcrum\" by this time, was involved in the Siege at Onderon. During the battle of Yerbana, Skywalker and Kenobi, after receiving a transmission that used the former's subspace Fulcrum frequency, believed Gerrera was reaching out to them, with the latter Jedi speculating something may have gone wrong with the Onderon siege. Admiral Wullf Yularen, however, let the Jedi know it was not Gerrera who was contacting them. In reality and as the two learned when they came aboard their Venator-class Star Destroyer, Tano and Lady Bo-Katan Kryze had contacted them to share information about the rogue Sith Lord Darth Maul.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The King's blessing[]\n\nShortly, Saw and the rebel leadership returned to their safehouse and were informed by trooper Dono that former King Dendup was scheduled to be executed by King Rash the next day in the central Yolahn Square. Steela surmised that Rash intended to kill his predecessor simply as an example to the rebels; to humiliate the freedom fighters and their cause. Tano reasoned that if Dendup was executed he would become a martyr and bolster the rebel cause. For his part, however, Saw ignored both the words of the war advisor and his sister and took it upon himself to rescue King Dendup before Rash even had a chance to publicly declare Dendup a traitor. Steela ordered Saw to stand down, but Saw, believing that his life was worth the risk of preserving Dendup's, covertly set out nonetheless, unaware that Steela had tasked Dono to tail him.\n\nAfter donning a cloak, Saw jogged to the foot of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square and scaled the multistory temple utilizing a grappling hook. Once atop the temple roof, Saw quickly spotted King Dendup in the temple courtyard and beheaded a nearby sentry droid while making his way to him. Saw bowed before his lord, swearing fealty to the former king and introduced himself, explaining to the king the execution situation. In angst, Dendup chastised Saw for \"interfering with the affairs of the throne\" by forming the resistance and confessed to Saw his failure as Saw's king: by not choosing to ally Onderon with either the Republic or the Confederacy during the Separatist Crisis, a side had been chosen for him; and as a result of Dendup's choice not to choose, the Onderonian Civil War had broken out, and Onderonians like Saw had stepped up to rectify his errs. Nonplussed, Saw encouraged Dendup, surprising the king with news that the rebels had the support of the Jedi Order. Greatly encouraged, Dendup agreed to escape with Saw, but when Saw fired his grappling hook to escape the royal prison courtyard, he was frustrated to find that it was blocked by a one-way shield, which alerted the Unifar Temple to the intrusion. As klaxons wailed and spotlights targeted, Saw and Dendup were taken into custody by a sextet of droidekas.\n\nSaw was transferred to the royal central command of the palace, where at Kalani and King Rash's order, Saw was cuffed and hung in a containment field and placed under interrogation by Kalani. General Akenathen Tandin of the Royal Onderon Militia supervised the investigation. Kalani tortured Saw for throughout the night but Saw the patriot of Onderon refused to divulge to the droid general any of of the rebel secrets. As a result, Kalani grew increasingly embittered, so he hiked up the dose of electric torture and the longevity of the doses; hoping Saw would break down. His body smoking from the electricity, Saw held to his beliefs and will and suffered the torture until Kalani and his EV-series medical droid heightened the electric shocks to great enough wattage to easily kill Saw. Saw hung while the torture took its toll not only on his body, but on his mind and spirit; Saw hardened himself and had begun on his irreversible path to becoming a remorseless soldier. Tandin, feeling sympathetic to his fellow Onderonian, commanded Kalani and his droids to give Saw rest. Kalani reluctantly agreed.\n\nShortly, Saw was given a drink of tea by Tandin, who questioned why Saw had chosen to rebel against Rash's throne, believing that Onderon's past under the rule of Ramsis Dendup was outdated, and the future was Onderon under Confederate rule. Saw explained that he chose to rebel because King Rash misused the power of the kingship to empower himself, rather than the people. Saw boomed over Tandin's arguments, proclaiming that he fought in Dendup's name for the former king had chosen to politically fight for the people, therefore not choosing to side with either the Republic or the Confederacy for his own gain as Rash so quickly had. Saw's words of patriotism weighed heavily on Tandin.\n\nThe next day, Rash and Kalani, escorted by a quartet of IG-100 MagnaGuards, marched King Dendup and Saw in chains to the steps of the Unifar Temple overlooking Yolahn Square to their intended executions. Hundreds of Iziz citizens gathered to witness the proceedings and listened to Rash's speech, where he declared Dendup and Saw traitors deserving of death by beheading. Rash prepared his MagnaGuards and their electrostaffs to behead Dendup utilizing an electroguillotine. However, trooper Dono, having relayed to Steela and Bonteri that Saw had been arrested, put into motion a raid to free Dendup and Saw from the Separatists\u2014Bonteri tossed smoke bombs into the Separatist ranks, causing chaos while Steela and other soldiers extracted Saw and Dendup. Saw even managed to knock Kalani to the ground with his binders before the group began their withdrawal. The retreat was cut short, however, when B2 battle droid reinforcements surrounded Steela's extraction team and forced her troopers to surrender their weapons\u2014much to the dismay of the Onderonian citizens, who had come to see Saw's rebels as allies, and Rash's Separatists as intruding invaders. Having regained control of the function, Rash prepared to execute Dendup and Saw once more along with the newly incarcerated Steela.\n\nHaving surrendered to his fate, Saw thanked his sister for her attempt to save his life. General Tandin on the other hand, having heard the truth in Saw's words hours prior, decided not to surrender Saw and Dendup to the fate Rash intended for them. He then tore into the square with his Onderon guards and held King Rash and Kalani at laser lance point. Saw was touched and surprised that Tandin had abandoned King Rash's Royal Court, and sided with the Onderonian rebels. Tandin used Rash as a human shield and ordered the rebels to flee into the city, thanking Saw for helping him see that he had betrayed the true Onderon by serving King Rash. The Royal Militia followed Saw and the rebels to their safehouse while Tano helped Tandin escape Rash and his forces.\n\nSometime later, Tandin expressed to King Dendup that he had, thanks to well-expressed words from Saw, officially defected from the Separatist-led Onderon Royal Court and pledged himself and his army to Saw's rebels and Dendup. Dendup, like Steela, believed that to win the civil war, they had to win the minds of the people. Saw agreed, and made it his priority to protect Dendup from the Confederate strength of Count Dooku who no doubt wanted Dendup dead more than ever after the day's debacle.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Early life and career[]\n\nSaw Gerrera was a human male who was born on the jungle planet Onderon during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Growing up within the walls of Onderon's capital city of Iziz as an Onderonian with his sister Steela Gerrera, Saw learned to greatly respect Onderon's monarch, longtime King Ramsis Dendup. In 24 BBY, thousands of star systems seceded from the Republic and formed their own galactic government, the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS). Within two years\u2014in 22 BBY\u2014the Republic and Confederacy broke into all-out war, the Clone Wars. King Dendup, wishing to keep his people out of the conflict, sided with neither the Republic and its newly-acquired Grand Army of clone troopers, nor the Confederacy.\n\nAfter the opening salvos of the Clone Wars were fired during the First Battle of Geonosis, the Clone War continued to sustain itself on battlefronts across the galaxy. At this time, at the behest of the Confederate Head of State Count Dooku of Serenno, the CIS instigated a coup that ousted Dendup from his royal throne and replaced with King Sanjay Rash, a \"puppet leader\" who answered directly to Count Dooku and cracked down on dissent. As ruler, Rash \"invited\" the Separatist Droid Army to Onderon\u2014but the act was actually an invasion of Saw's homeworld\u2014and subjected its citizens to Confederate law. Immediately after the planet joined the CIS, Saw\u2014who was deeply troubled for Onderon's future and undeterred that he and Steela had been banished from Iziz for openly defying King Rash\u2014and Steela began to gather resources and other like-minded individuals in the hopes of forming a resistance to fight against Rash and his battle droid forces.\n\nAt some stage, a young Gerrera found himself taken prisoner and forced into a rhydonium work camp in the hot Onderon jungles, where non-droid guards oversaw him and several hundred other young workers. The elder workers among them, meanwhile, had quickly died where they stood, leaving nothing but a few bones Gerrera and his fellow workers discovered the day after their deaths. Gerrera and his fellow younger workers found their clothing burning away and thus worked back and forth while naked. During one day, Gerrera, his fellow workers, and the guards all began to itch after a rhydonium leakage occurred, with the feeling seeping into their skin before the smell hit them. Gerrera found himself entranced by the new sensation and refused to run away, instead coming to love its smell and the itchy, burning feeling the substance gave. Whereas others would don a mask before working with rhydonium, Gerrera believed he understood the substance and thus did not require that gear.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The King's blessing[]\n\nShortly, Saw and the rebel leadership returned to their safehouse and were informed by trooper Dono that former King Dendup was scheduled to be executed by King Rash the next day in the central Yolahn Square. Steela surmised that Rash intended to kill his predecessor simply as an example to the rebels; to humiliate the freedom fighters and their cause. Tano reasoned that if Dendup was executed he would become a martyr and bolster the rebel cause. For his part, however, Saw ignored both the words of the war advisor and his sister and took it upon himself to rescue King Dendup before Rash even had a chance to publicly declare Dendup a traitor. Steela ordered Saw to stand down, but Saw, believing that his life was worth the risk of preserving Dendup's, covertly set out nonetheless, unaware that Steela had tasked Dono to tail him.\n\nAfter donning a cloak, Saw jogged to the foot of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square and scaled the multistory temple utilizing a grappling hook. Once atop the temple roof, Saw quickly spotted King Dendup in the temple courtyard and beheaded a nearby sentry droid while making his way to him. Saw bowed before his lord, swearing fealty to the former king and introduced himself, explaining to the king the execution situation. In angst, Dendup chastised Saw for \"interfering with the affairs of the throne\" by forming the resistance and confessed to Saw his failure as Saw's king: by not choosing to ally Onderon with either the Republic or the Confederacy during the Separatist Crisis, a side had been chosen for him; and as a result of Dendup's choice not to choose, the Onderonian Civil War had broken out, and Onderonians like Saw had stepped up to rectify his errs. Nonplussed, Saw encouraged Dendup, surprising the king with news that the rebels had the support of the Jedi Order. Greatly encouraged, Dendup agreed to escape with Saw, but when Saw fired his grappling hook to escape the royal prison courtyard, he was frustrated to find that it was blocked by a one-way shield, which alerted the Unifar Temple to the intrusion. As klaxons wailed and spotlights targeted, Saw and Dendup were taken into custody by a sextet of droidekas.\n\nSaw was transferred to the royal central command of the palace, where at Kalani and King Rash's order, Saw was cuffed and hung in a containment field and placed under interrogation by Kalani. General Akenathen Tandin of the Royal Onderon Militia supervised the investigation. Kalani tortured Saw for throughout the night but Saw the patriot of Onderon refused to divulge to the droid general any of of the rebel secrets. As a result, Kalani grew increasingly embittered, so he hiked up the dose of electric torture and the longevity of the doses; hoping Saw would break down. His body smoking from the electricity, Saw held to his beliefs and will and suffered the torture until Kalani and his EV-series medical droid heightened the electric shocks to great enough wattage to easily kill Saw. Saw hung while the torture took its toll not only on his body, but on his mind and spirit; Saw hardened himself and had begun on his irreversible path to becoming a remorseless soldier. Tandin, feeling sympathetic to his fellow Onderonian, commanded Kalani and his droids to give Saw rest. Kalani reluctantly agreed.\n\nShortly, Saw was given a drink of tea by Tandin, who questioned why Saw had chosen to rebel against Rash's throne, believing that Onderon's past under the rule of Ramsis Dendup was outdated, and the future was Onderon under Confederate rule. Saw explained that he chose to rebel because King Rash misused the power of the kingship to empower himself, rather than the people. Saw boomed over Tandin's arguments, proclaiming that he fought in Dendup's name for the former king had chosen to politically fight for the people, therefore not choosing to side with either the Republic or the Confederacy for his own gain as Rash so quickly had. Saw's words of patriotism weighed heavily on Tandin.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The true cost of conflict[]\n\nThe war raged on and the resistance eventually moved their headquarters from the urban population of Iziz to the remote eastern mountain range known as the Onderon highlands, where, back in the jungle, Saw was reunited with his team. At the highlands, Saw and the rebels constructed a new base, known as \"the nest;\" named for the rupings who used the highlands as a nesting ground. During this time, Padawan Tano and Bonteri enacted a quick mission back to Iziz where they utilized a holographic message of King-in-exile Dendup declared his allegiance to the Onderon rebels, whom he called patriots of true Onderon. Upon their return, Bonteri informed Saw that the civilians had taken to the Iziz streets to riot as a result of hearing Dendup's message. Encouraged, Saw voiced his desire to join the civilians and take the fight straight to Rash in the streets of Iziz, but Steela, Tano, Tandin, and King Dendup, all disagreed\u2014they believed the rebels needed to avoid civilian casualties at all costs, thus the Confederate forces had to be drawn out of the crowded city and into the wilderness of the highlands.\n\nIt wasn't long before Kalani located the rebels in the highlands and sent his army out to confront them. Meanwhile, the rebels and Royal bodyguards dug into the jungle mesas and prepared to repel the droid infantry. Once the battle of the Onderonian highlands began, Saw led a group of ruping riders, providing air support for the dalgo-mounted cavalry commanded by Tandin. The Confederate forces were caught off-guard by the rebels attack and were mostly destroyed by the rebels diverse forces of rupings, cavalry, snipers, and blaster cannons mounted on towering fambaas. Saw and his riders swept over the battlefront, destroying the droid's support vehicles with grenades. However, before the skirmish could be won, three HMP droid gunships entered the fray and systematically turned the tide of battle by killing much of Tandin's cavalry and fambaas. Saw's ruping riders were downed by two, and Saw was forced to hide from the droid fighters and recollect himself. Seizing the next opportunity, Saw bore his ruping towards a distracted gunship and lobbed a detonator at the hovering droid. However, the detonator did no damage to the craft as it was heavily ray shielded. The gunship next targeted Saw, and it managed to kill his ruping, throwing Saw to the ground. With the battle's tide having turned, Tandin's cavalry retreated, and the Royal General hoisted Saw atop his dalgo as the surviving rebel forces retreated back to the nest in complete disarray.\n\nAt the nest, the Gerreras, Tandin, Tano, and Bonteri convened to strategize. Tano explained that she had contacted her Jedi superiors Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and requested aid from the Jedi Council, but he wasn't sure he would be able to help the rebels. Refusing to be discouraged, Steela pointed out that since the droid could not be stopped before reaching the nest, the fort had to be fortified for the incoming invasion. Emboldened by her spirit, Saw expressed how proud he was of his sister. She accredited her skills as a leader to watching Saw. Saw returned to organize the defense at the battlefront a short distance from the nest, and shortly, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela arrived bearing new armaments provided by Skywalker and Kenobi through the Weequay Hondo Ohnaka, the pirate lord of the Ohnaka Gang: Sienar Fleet Systems RPS-6 rocket launchers. Saw immediately took one of the rocket launchers and fired a missile at a nearby gunship. The droid ship was brought down by the single shot; revitalizing the rebels' resolve to fight now that they had a weapon that could deal damage. The launchers were being distributed among the insurgents, when word came that the nest had been found and was under attack by the remaining gunships.\n\nSteela hurriedly took the rupings with her troops and headed the short distance back atop the mesas where the fort was located in order to protect King Dendup. Saw, meanwhile, with a pair of soldiers, supported Steela by distracting the gunships. Within minutes, only one gunship remained, and Saw took aim with his launcher and shot down the final droid ship. The mortally damaged ship careened through the sky and smashed into a cliff face where Steela was protecting Dendup from several commando droids. The weakened cliff face gave way, and Saw was horrified to see that Steela had fallen with it, and was hanging from the cliff edge. Tano began using the Force to lift Steela to safety, but the droid gunship remained partially active, and it fired on Tano, striking her in the shoulder with a bolt. Tano's wound disrupted her concentration long enough for her telekinetic hold on Steela to be severed. Saw ran in horror to his fallen sister as she fell to her death on the rocks below. As Saw cradled Steela's lifeless body, he recounted the fact that it had been he who had shot down the gunship. Saw was racked with a guilt; a guilt he would never banish from his mind.\n\nThe rebels emerged victorious over the Separatists in the highlands, and the Confederate defeat prompted Dooku to withdraw Kalani and his forces from Onderon and move to the planet Agamar due to the apparent long-term conflict the rebels intended to fight. And later in the day, the rebels returned to Iziz, where Dendup was reinstated as King\u2014Sanjay Rash having been assassinated by Kalani on Dooku's orders after the Confederate defeat in the highlands. Later, a funeral was held for Steela on the steps of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square. Thousands of Onderonians turned up for the funeral in mourning over Steela's untimely death. Saw paid his respects over his sister's sarcophagus and rejected Tano and Bonteri's condolences, angry he couldn't prevent Steela's death. Full of guilt and brokenhearted, Gerrera made it his mission to continue his battle against all forms of what he considered evil.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Helping the Ersos[]\n\nSometime before 17 BBY, Gerrera joined an arms smuggling ring led by Has Obitt. The smugglers were to deliver arms to resistance fighters in the Salient system, however, this smuggling ring was the brainchild of Orson Krennic. Krennic was using small uprisings as an excuse to take control of planets heavy in resources needed to build the Death Star. Obitt had revealed this information to his smuggler partners, and they decided to double-cross the Empire. When they arrived at Salient, it became clear that the Empire was expecting to arrest Obitt and the other mercenaries. Gerrera convinced Obitt to stay and fight the Empire. The people of the Salient system eventually lost the battle and Obitt was captured and later released by Wilhuff Tarkin; Gerrera, however, was able to escape.\n\nIn 17 BBY, Obitt came in contact with Lyra Erso. Erso wanted to have her husband, Galen, to quit working with Krennic, and the only way to do so was for the family to flee Coruscant. Obitt, who had known the Ersos since Jyn's birth, knew Krennic would expect him to help the Ersos, so he asked Gerrera to go in his stead. Gerrera smuggled Lyra, Galen, and Jyn Erso off Coruscant and helped them set up a homestead on Lah'mu. The Ersos stayed vigilant while living on Lah'mu, forming an escape plan in case Krennic found them. The plan was for Lyra and Jyn Erso to hide in a shelter dug under a cave and to contact Gerrera for extraction.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - A death on Li'eta[]\n\nShortly after deserting the Partisans, Vak-Nhalis murdered a woman at a machine shop on Li'eta, an act that caught Gerrera's attention. Three days later, Gerrera found Vak-Nhalis at a cantina in the city of Quovel'cha. Dismissing local Imperial propaganda, Gerrera joined Vak-Nhalis at his booth, surmising the mess was intended to draw him out, as he needed Vak-Nhalis to locate the cache and Vak-Nhalis apparently needed him, perhaps for transportation. Gerrera asked if Vak-Nhalis meant to capture him or kill him and hijack his ship, to which Vak-Nhalis replied that either would do.\n\nVak-Nhalis, who expected to be lured in turn, told Gerrera as much. The revolutionary admitted that finding Vak-Nhalis was no easy task, though credits helped immensely. Gerrera requested to relay a story before they fought; Vak-Nhalis obliged. With a nasty grin, the revolutionary recounted Onderon's proud royal history, its Republic-Separatist neutrality, and the usurpation of King Dendup by Separatist pawn Sanjay Rash, who lied about his rise to power, installed a regime loyal to himself, and enacted new laws under the pretense of stability, paralleling the current galactic state. Though he had liberated his king, Gerrera had failed to protect his world; the Emperor ordered Onderon to surrender their weapons and allies to a newly-installed governor. Expectant that the planet would fall in line, the Emperor was twice denied by Onderon, exposing the Imperial regime's lies about peace and stability as it tried to wipe out the Onderonian people.\n\nLater, as Gerrera was accompanied by Vorgorath and Rynark to trade red water from the planet Po'yin for weapons and credits, he learned of Vak-Nhalis' terrorist attack on Coruscant.\n\n",

The Partisans discovered that one of the Empire's refineries was using wroshyr tree sap to make a powerful compound. Following that, they met Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis, who they asked for help in their attempts to free the Wookiees.\n\nIn return for Kestis' assistance in the attack on Kashyyyk, the Partisans agreed to search for Wookiee Chieftan Tarfful, who could aid Kestis in searching for a Jedi holocron with the names of several force-sensitive children. After the takeover of the refinery, Gerrera made a speech to encourage the flame of rebellion against the Empire and offered Kestis a place among the Partisans, saying that it would be nice to have a Jedi fighting at his side. Kestis felt honored by the offer, but he refused because he could not abandon his mission. Gerrera said the offer continued before it leaves. After finding Tarfful in the Shadowlands, the Partisans became overwhelmed by the Imperial forces, and the majority were forced to retreat before Kestis returned to Kashyyyk. Those who remained on Kashyyyk did so to Gerrera's disdain.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Raven's Peak[]\n\nAbout a year into the New Order, one of Gerrera's earliest operations against the Empire took place at an Imperial summit held on Eriadu. In the facility known as Raven's Peak, Governor Tarkin headed a table of five highly ranked officers, including Doctor Royce Hemlock. Gerrera lead a small infiltration team into the facility, disguised as stormtroopers, with the intention of completely destroying the base. Armed with remote explosives, the team stealthily littered the lower levels with them. When they were almost finished, Gerrera ran into another group of intruders: Clone Force 99. Gerrera explained his plan to the clones, to which Hunter protested, as they had a separate goal to track Hemlock to the location of imprisoned clone troopers. Despite logical counterarguments made by Tech, Gerrera insisted it needed to be done \"for the greater good.\"\n\nBefore the two group's conversation could conclude, a security team interrupted, forcing them to part ways. With the imperials alerted to their presence, Gerrera order his comrades to retreat to an escape shuttle, although they had failed to place detonators in the command center. Most of his team fought their way to the shuttle and off-world, at which point Gerrera promptly detonated the explosives. While the explosion destroyed the hangar and much of the interior, the command tower was left undamaged. Unbeknownst to Gerrera, it had also caused a power outage to the facility's skyrail, which Clone Force 99 was using to escape. Ultimately, due to Gerrera's actions, Hemlock's tracked shuttle was destroyed and Tech was forced to sacrifice himself to allow his companions to escape.\n\nGerrera fought against the Imperial Military and reorganized the Onderon resistance into a group he dubbed the Partisans. Around 18 BBY, he hired a Lasat mercenary and fought an Imperial squad under ISB Agent Kallus when they were sent to Onderon to bring peace; the mercenary and other allied partisans killed Kallus' entire unit, save Kallus himself Gerrera ultimately came to think Onderon was lost and thus retreated from his own homeworld, however.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Recovering Vak-Nhalis[]\n\nLater that year, Gerrera, who had been fed rumors by prisoners of war about Separatist caches, orchestrated and participated in hijacking a starship belonging to Old Krezchak, a pirate raiding Confederacy installations across eight sectors. Krezchak refused to negotiate or surrender his cargo, leading to his death. Encountering the Separatist operative Soujen Vak-Nhalis, Gerrera ordered him to stop and, when the man attempted to flee, shot him with a modified DC-15A blaster carbine that overloaded his cybernetics. Gerrera asked if Vak-Nhalis felt its effects, which he affirmed.\n\nThe Onderonian questioned whether Vak-Nhalis, who had just awoken from a hibernation pod, knew about the Empire, ascertaining that the stranger was calculating how to kill him. Expediting the conversation, Gerrera revealed that he was aware of the saboteur's history and offered to let Vak-Nhalis accompany him or go down with the ship; Vak-Nhalis accepted the former. Explaining that Krezchak intended to auction Vak-Nhalis on Kafrene, Gerrera observed that Vak-Nhalis did not ask many questions, comparing him to a battle droid. Descending into the hatch connecting Krezchak's ship to his own, the Dalgo, Vak-Nhalis attacked Gerrera, aiming for the other man's back as to break his spine. The cyborg's ambush failed, and he was incapacitated by an ion mine clamped to the bulkhead. As Vak-Nhalis passed out, Gerrera provided his name, declaring that the Separatist belonged in his grave.\n\nGathered in a cavern, Gerrera conversed with two of his soldiers, Karama and Vorgorath. Karama criticized Gerrera, suggesting targeted strikes against guard posts and clone troopers; Gerrera dismissed clones as a tool of the enemy that could be replaced,  desiring instead to make fighting the war against the Empire a battle of attrition. Vorgorath disparaged Karama's constant questioning, but Gerrera, noting the pair's accomplishments, found the questions inoffensive, extending the sentiment to include answering Vak-Nhalis' inquiries if he proved useful.\n\nGerrera introduced Vak-Nhalis to Nankry, another guerrilla, but the assassin declined to test her skills. Vak-Nhalis took one of Gerrera's ration packs, causing the man to laugh, who in turn allowed the Separatist to eat. Gerrera asked whether Vak-Nhalis had heard of him, to which he did not reply, and spoke about Onderon's history with the Republic and the government's transition into the Empire, Gerrera comparing the self-appointed Emperor Palpatine to his own world's tyrant, King Rash. Vak-Nhalis accused Gerrera of looking for an excuse to fight, but the insurgent charged the Empire with tightening its grip on Onderon, murdering the Jedi, and instigating the conflict.\n\nNankry came at Vak-Nhalis while he ate, causing a short scuffle. The other guerrillas rose to their feet, though Gerrera stood back. The scrap, resulting in a stalemate, ended when Gerrera told his fighters to stand down, indicating to Vak-Nhalis that the attack, although lethal, had been a test. Vak-Nhalis threatened Gerrera with death if it happened again, which he agreed was fair before requesting that they speak privately. Alone, Gerrera explained the need for supplies to fight the Empire to Vak-Nhalis, recounting the rumors that led him to the pirate ship that he had salvaged the assassin from. Gerrera deduced that the operative was himself a Separatist contingency, which Vak-Nhalis did not deny, before inquiring how much of him was machine or man and if he had been conscripted.\n\nVak-Nhalis stated that Gerrera wanted to control him, which the Onderonian admitted to if it was possible. Gerrera asked about Vak-Nhalis' orders, but the saboteur insisted he be direct. The revolutionary elaborated on his desire for provisions and resources beyond what Krezchak had envisioned. Vak-Nhalis posed if Gerrera's renegades wanted to fight the Republic; the Empire. Gerrera reasoned that the Empire wanted them all dead, so his troops would either learn to hit back or continue to suffer Empire's abuse. Gerrera offered to let Vak-Nhalis depart unhindered to hunt Separatists or Imperials or abandon the fight entirely, though Vak-Nhalis did not trust Gerrera would let him leave alive, or join Gerrera's own efforts and discover the funding of the cyborg's late investors. Vak-Nhalis chose to remain willingly. Gerrera laughed as he returned to the cave, though Vak-Nhalis did not join him, choosing to remain behind instead.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Recovering Vak-Nhalis[]\n\nLater that year, Gerrera, who had been fed rumors by prisoners of war about Separatist caches, orchestrated and participated in hijacking a starship belonging to Old Krezchak, a pirate raiding Confederacy installations across eight sectors. Krezchak refused to negotiate or surrender his cargo, leading to his death. Encountering the Separatist operative Soujen Vak-Nhalis, Gerrera ordered him to stop and, when the man attempted to flee, shot him with a modified DC-15A blaster carbine that overloaded his cybernetics. Gerrera asked if Vak-Nhalis felt its effects, which he affirmed.\n\nThe Onderonian questioned whether Vak-Nhalis, who had just awoken from a hibernation pod, knew about the Empire, ascertaining that the stranger was calculating how to kill him. Expediting the conversation, Gerrera revealed that he was aware of the saboteur's history and offered to let Vak-Nhalis accompany him or go down with the ship; Vak-Nhalis accepted the former. Explaining that Krezchak intended to auction Vak-Nhalis on Kafrene, Gerrera observed that Vak-Nhalis did not ask many questions, comparing him to a battle droid. Descending into the hatch connecting Krezchak's ship to his own, the Dalgo, Vak-Nhalis attacked Gerrera, aiming for the other man's back as to break his spine. The cyborg's ambush failed, and he was incapacitated by an ion mine clamped to the bulkhead. As Vak-Nhalis passed out, Gerrera provided his name, declaring that the Separatist belonged in his grave.\n\nGathered in a cavern, Gerrera conversed with two of his soldiers, Karama and Vorgorath. Karama criticized Gerrera, suggesting targeted strikes against guard posts and clone troopers; Gerrera dismissed clones as a tool of the enemy that could be replaced,  desiring instead to make fighting the war against the Empire a battle of attrition. Vorgorath disparaged Karama's constant questioning, but Gerrera, noting the pair's accomplishments, found the questions inoffensive, extending the sentiment to include answering Vak-Nhalis' inquiries if he proved useful.\n\nGerrera introduced Vak-Nhalis to Nankry, another guerrilla, but the assassin declined to test her skills. Vak-Nhalis took one of Gerrera's ration packs, causing the man to laugh, who in turn allowed the Separatist to eat. Gerrera asked whether Vak-Nhalis had heard of him, to which he did not reply, and spoke about Onderon's history with the Republic and the government's transition into the Empire, Gerrera comparing the self-appointed Emperor Palpatine to his own world's tyrant, King Rash. Vak-Nhalis accused Gerrera of looking for an excuse to fight, but the insurgent charged the Empire with tightening its grip on Onderon, murdering the Jedi, and instigating the conflict.\n\nNankry came at Vak-Nhalis while he ate, causing a short scuffle. The other guerrillas rose to their feet, though Gerrera stood back. The scrap, resulting in a stalemate, ended when Gerrera told his fighters to stand down, indicating to Vak-Nhalis that the attack, although lethal, had been a test. Vak-Nhalis threatened Gerrera with death if it happened again, which he agreed was fair before requesting that they speak privately. Alone, Gerrera explained the need for supplies to fight the Empire to Vak-Nhalis, recounting the rumors that led him to the pirate ship that he had salvaged the assassin from. Gerrera deduced that the operative was himself a Separatist contingency, which Vak-Nhalis did not deny, before inquiring how much of him was machine or man and if he had been conscripted.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Mentor for Jyn[]\n\nIn 13 BBY Saw was tasked with protecting Jyn, after Lyra was killed and Galen was taken by Orson Krennic to continue his work on the Death Star. He rescued Jyn from Lah'mu and brought her to the planet Wrea, where he had an outpost set up that was still mostly empty of occupants. He revealed his dislike for droids after Jyn suggested he obtain a unit. The day after her arrival, Jyn found a training ground set up with hanging husks of dilapidated droids used for targeting practice by Saw. Jyn then asked for Saw's help in training to fight. On the third day of her stay, she got the chance to practice her hand to hand skills on several sets of stormtrooper armor Saw had put up for her benefit. Gerrera had many partisans, including Reece Tallent, a human who Gerrera personally trained, the Twi'lek Xosad Hozem, and Idryssa Barruck, who Jyn took a liking to. Supplying the fighters with a place to stay, food, although mainly in the form of nutritive milk, and operations for them to undertake, Wrea became a hub for various rebel fighters to visit for various reasons.\n\nIn 10 BBY, Saw allowed Jyn to accompany him while he negotiated with Enfys Nest for coaxium obtained from the syndicate Crimson Dawn.\n\nIn 9 BBY, Saw received military information stolen from the Empire by Cal Kestis, who had maintained liaison with Saw since they first met on Kashyyyk.\n\nIn 6 BBY, Saw and several other members of his Partisans were hired by Arane Oreida to go to Inusagi and to infiltrate Sakoola blossom festival and kill Governor Cor Tophervin. He and his Partisans massacred the festival, killing Imperials, the Inusagi chieftess, guests and many Inusagian civilians to send a message to the Empire.\n\nAs Jyn matured, and as Saw became increasingly paranoid over time, he came to fear that Jyn would eventually be recognized as the daughter of a known Imperial collaborator and thus exploited to be used as a ransom against Galen. To help prevent this, Saw tortured Partisans to assess if they knew of Jyn's identity, even disposing of Jari at an unknown Imperial barracks due to the same reason. With the constant worry of others finding out Jyn's identity Saw decided, when Jyn was sixteen, to abandon her in a bunker with nothing more than a knife and a blaster for protection. He had instructed her to wait in the bunker until morning, by which time Saw was gone. He came to justify the decision by telling himself, and later her, that she was already one of his best people and that he knew she could survive without his aid. The decision was seen as a betrayal by Jyn, left a feeling of disenchantment for Saw, and for the rebellion in general, in her mind.\n\n",

Believing the Empire's existence to pose a threat to all they had fought for during the Clone Wars, Gerrera and his militia began pushing back against the Empire, drawing the attention of Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin. In response, Tarkin deployed experimental Clone Force 99 to deal with Gerrera's faction, though also as a test of Clone Force 99's loyalty. Upon arriving and seeing Gerrera's group, the squad refused to execute their orders, save for Crosshair, who insisted on fulfilling the mission. Gerrera and his men apprehended the squad of clones, but soon released them, giving Hunter, the squad's leader, a chance to pick a side. Gerrera then left with his militia, leaving the squad of clones alone. Later, a new squadron led by Crosshair, who had left the Clone Force 99 due to their defection from the Empire, arrived to finish the mission to eliminate Saw and his militia. However, Saw was already gone, and the only ones left were some militia members and some civilians. All were killed, including the Elite Squad Trooper ES-01, who refused to eliminate the civilians, causing him to be executed for treason by Crosshair.\n\n",

Saw, meanwhile, with a pair of soldiers, supported Steela by distracting the gunships. Within minutes, only one gunship remained, and Saw took aim with his launcher and shot down the final droid ship. The mortally damaged ship careened through the sky and smashed into a cliff face where Steela was protecting Dendup from several commando droids. The weakened cliff face gave way, and Saw was horrified to see that Steela had fallen with it, and was hanging from the cliff edge. Tano began using the Force to lift Steela to safety, but the droid gunship remained partially active, and it fired on Tano, striking her in the shoulder with a bolt. Tano's wound disrupted her concentration long enough for her telekinetic hold on Steela to be severed. Saw ran in horror to his fallen sister as she fell to her death on the rocks below. As Saw cradled Steela's lifeless body, he recounted the fact that it had been he who had shot down the gunship. Saw was racked with a guilt; a guilt he would never banish from his mind.\n\nThe rebels emerged victorious over the Separatists in the highlands, and the Confederate defeat prompted Dooku to withdraw Kalani and his forces from Onderon and move to the planet Agamar due to the apparent long-term conflict the rebels intended to fight.

Later, a funeral was held for Steela on the steps of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square. Thousands of Onderonians turned up for the funeral in mourning over Steela's untimely death. Saw paid his respects over his sister's sarcophagus and rejected Tano and Bonteri's condolences, angry he couldn't prevent Steela's death. Full of guilt and brokenhearted, Gerrera made it his mission to continue his battle against all forms of what he considered evil.",

Hundreds of Iziz citizens gathered to witness the proceedings and listened to Rash's speech, where he declared Dendup and Saw traitors deserving of death by beheading. Rash prepared his MagnaGuards and their electrostaffs to behead Dendup utilizing an electroguillotine. However, trooper Dono, having relayed to Steela and Bonteri that Saw had been arrested, put into motion a raid to free Dendup and Saw from the Separatists\u2014Bonteri tossed smoke bombs into the Separatist ranks, causing chaos while Steela and other soldiers extracted Saw and Dendup. Saw even managed to knock Kalani to the ground with his binders before the group began their withdrawal. The retreat was cut short, however, when B2 battle droid reinforcements surrounded Steela's extraction team and forced her troopers to surrender their weapons\u2014much to the dismay of the Onderonian citizens, who had come to see Saw's rebels as allies, and Rash's Separatists as intruding invaders. Having regained control of the function, Rash prepared to execute Dendup and Saw once more along with the newly incarcerated Steela.\n\nHaving surrendered to his fate, Saw thanked his sister for her attempt to save his life. General Tandin on the other hand, having heard the truth in Saw's words hours prior, decided not to surrender Saw and Dendup to the fate Rash intended for them. He then tore into the square with his Onderon guards and held King Rash and Kalani at laser lance point. Saw was touched and surprised that Tandin had abandoned King Rash's Royal Court, and sided with the Onderonian rebels. Tandin used Rash as a human shield and ordered the rebels to flee into the city, thanking Saw for helping him see that he had betrayed the true Onderon by serving King Rash. The Royal Militia followed Saw and the rebels to their safehouse while Tano helped Tandin escape Rash and his forces.\n\nSometime later, Tandin expressed to King Dendup that he had, thanks to well-expressed words from Saw, officially defected from the Separatist-led Onderon Royal Court and pledged himself and his army to Saw's rebels and Dendup. Dendup, like Steela, believed that to win the civil war, they had to win the minds of the people.

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Helping hand from the Jedi[]\n\nApproximately two standard years later, in 20 BBY, Saw had become the self-proclaimed de facto leader of the Onderon rebels, and as a result of being banished from Iziz, the rebels took up residence in an abandoned outpost within a group of ancient ruins in Sector S-29 of the wilderness. Around this time, Lux Bonteri, the son of the late Mina Bonteri, the former senator of Onderon in the Republic's Galactic Senate joined Saw and his resistance. Having obtained enough armor, blasters, and various other small arms to supply their forces, Saw, Steela, and Bonteri plotted to take back Iziz for Onderon; the rebel leaders, however, after a number of small skirmishes with battle droid forces, came to the realization that they were both under-equipped and had neither the training nor skills to wage open war against the Confederacy. Therefore, Saw and Bonteri reached out to the Republic, requesting aid even though Gerrera had no personal loyalty to the Republic government: in his mind, a pact with the Republic was simply a way to ensure Onderon secured its freedom.\n\nUltimately, the esteemed Jedi High Council on the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, heard Saw and Bonteri's story via HoloNet transmission. Grand Master Yoda promised that the Jedi Order would find a way to aid them. A short time later, the freedom fighters were alerted to an intrusion in the jungle Sector S-11 and Steela led a squad to investigate. Shortly, Steela, mounted on a dalgo steed, returned with Yoda's promise: Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Togruta Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and 501st Legion clone trooper Rex. Saw, mounted on his reptavian ruping, welcomed the four Republic Military advisors to his world. Skywalker informed Saw that they couldn't fight the Onderonian Civil War for the resistance\u2014Onderon, after all, was legitimately aligned with the Confederacy, no matter how illegitimate Saw viewed the situation\u2014but he would train Saw's resistance to fight well on their own. While Gerrera and his comrades had wanted the Republic to be directly involved in their struggle, they still appreciated the aid and believed it to be a good deal.\n\nRex explained that, as a clone trooper, he would assist the Jedi Generals. After relocating a half-kilometer to a clearing in the jungle where a captured Separatist Armored Assault Tank was left dormant, Jedi Commander Tano and Clone Captain Rex instructed the freedom fighters on how to disable the tank: they had drop a pair of Electro Magnetic Pulse grenades\u2014\"droid poppers\"\u2014into both the tank's cockpits, one for the pilot and one for the gunner. Saw and Bonteri teamed for the exercise, but sharing in a tense rivalry, incidentally sabotaged one another by refusing to cooperate. Disgusted, Saw ridiculed Bonteri for being a \"terrible soldier,\" which disappointed the Jedi advisors. As the day wore on, Saw grew increasingly frustrated, berating Steela for regularly attending to Bonteri, with whom she shared a mutual attraction. As the confrontation between Saw and Bonteri almost came to blows, Steela defused the two men, explaining that there would be both a time for the direct fight that Saw desired, and the political speeches that Bonteri excelled at.\n\nThe rebels next returned to the encampment, where General Skywalker and Rex demonstrated how to most efficiently disable droideka security droids. Protected by a deflector shield, droidekas were immune to blaster bolts. Skywalker, thus, indicated that a slowly rolled droid popper was the best way to disable the droids. Confident in his abilities, Saw stepped up and attempted the technique first; however, he rolled the grenade too quickly and failed to penetrate the shield. Bonteri tried next and succeeded. Later, after many tries and much coaching from Tano, Saw managed to roll the grenade at the right speed and pierce the shield.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Jedi advisors moved on to coaching the rebels on how to properly utilize their blaster rifles. Steela, a sniper, impressed the Jedi with her skill. But while practicing, she was alerted to the fact that their encampment was under attack. Separatist B1-series battle droids and an Assault Tank pushed through the brush and opened fire on the rebels. Saw narrowly avoided being taken out by a missile blast from a B2-HA super battle droid, and advanced onto the frontline of the skirmish and returned fire. At a signal from the Jedi and Steela, Saw and other rebels heaved disruptor explosives into the path of the droids. Still outgunned, Steela loosed the dalgos, falumpasets, and tee-muss mammals, which stampeded and trampled the remaining droids. With only the armored tank remaining, Saw and Bonteri tried once more to disable the tank. On this attempt, however, the rebels worked together and succeeded in destroying the tank with a pair of thermal detonators. Elated in their first victory, Saw quipped that Bonteri looked more like a soldier than a politician, due to the grit that had come to cover him during the altercation. Knowing that their base location was compromised, the rebels and their advisors concocted a plan to infiltrate Iziz and pose as civilians in the hopes that they could wage the guerrilla war from within the capital.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - The perfect night[]\n\nOnce the Partisans arrived at their actual target, Paak began calibrating the mechanism on a pipeline. As he waited, Gerrera began to tell a story from his younger days, reminiscing on his internment to a labour camp in the Onderonian jungle and the horrific conditions he faced, one of three hundred prisoners working in weather so hot they were forced to work naked. One day, everyone at the camp started to itch simultaneously, caused by a spillage of rhydonium that could be felt before being smelt. While everyone fled, Gerrera was the only one to stay, because the rhydo was 'new to [him]'. Wilmon then succeeded in arming the device, which caused rhydonium steam to begin spilling from a valve in front of them.\n\nGerrera approached the steam with glee and muttered about his love for it, causing Wilmon to react with alarm and confusion as he began huffing the rhydonium with no side effects. Gerrera could do so because he understood the rhydo, loving it like a sister and calling the burn a joy. He suspected Wilmon thought him crazy, but instead admitted that he was; revolution wasn't for the sane, but the broken and hunted like them still stand, despite knowing they won't live to see the Republic reborn. He questioned where Wilmon was at that moment, then began to howl that he was right there with Gerrera and ready to fight. Inspired by Gerrera's words, Wilmon removed his protective mask and began painfully breathing in the rhydo, fuelled by Gerrera's wild inspirations urging him to let it in. As Wilmon screamed in agony from the rhydo's burn, Gerrera cheered for him to let his newfound freedom run wild.",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Jalindi and a personal quest[]\n\nIn 1 BBY, Saw was first mentioned by Bail Organa, where he gave information that was supplied by Saw; primarily, a new relay being used by the Empire. When the Rebellion wanted to tap into the relay to learn what the Empire was doing, Saw, who had sent an astromech, appeared and stated that they were cowards, as they were not doing what it would take to win. After Mon Mothma cut off communications with him, Saw prepared to head to the relay to destroy it. He arrived on his U-Wing with the help of his pilot, Edrio. Upon opening the doors to drop bombs, he was surprised to see Ezra and Sabine, greeting the two while tossing out three packs of proton bombs onto the relay. Telling them that the bombs would detonate soon, he let them board his starfighter and proceeded to fly out of the area just as the bombs exploded, destroying the relay and killing Brom Titus.\n\nOutside in Jalindi's space, Hera contacted him and told him to return Ezra and Sabine. Saw agreed and prepared the process; however, a Star Destroyer suddenly appeared, forcing Saw to leave for Faos Station with them. During the trip, Saw told the two that he needed their help as, after the events on Geonosis, he still did not know what the Empire was building. Upon arriving at Faos Station, he, Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper boarded Freighter 2716.\n\nUpon investigating the materials, which were used for the construction of Star Destroyers, Saw claimed that the Empire was up to something. Continuing his investigation, they found Imperial stormtroopers on the ship and learned that the freighter was heading towards the remote Tonnis sector, cementing Saw's suspicions. When Chopper told him that hold 12 contained an Imperial shuttle, they went in and found prisoners, who were either power or reactor technicians. Later on when Ezra kept hearing \"singing,\" Chopper revealed that hold 17 was a restricted area. Upon opening the door to that hold, they encountered a death trooper, prompting Saw to fire at point-blank range, killing the trooper. Sabine tossed several smoke grenades into the room, which Saw used to blend in and take down several troopers.\n\nAfter clearing the area, one of the troopers managed to escape. Saw wanted to go after her, but Sabine told him not to. They inspected the mysterious cargo the troopers were protecting and realized that it was an unusually large kyber crystal. Saw, adamant in finding out what the Empire was building, reluctantly stayed to guard the crystal while Ezra and Sabine went to sabotage the hyperspace drive. However, he quickly betrayed them and stunned the two in the engine room.\n\nWhen Ezra and Sabine woke up, they asked Saw why he betrayed them. Saw stated that they were very close to finding out the secret weapon and told them to look on the screen. When the freighter arrived at the Tonnis sector, they only saw a single Star Destroyer. Confused, but still convinced of the Empire's nefarious designs with the crystal, he used Ezra's lightsaber to destroy the freighter's hyperdrive before firing onto the crystal's mounting, effectively turning the crystal into a time bomb. He then freed the two, while Edrio, who had tailed the freighter, informed Saw that he was outside. Knowing that Ezra and Sabine no longer agreed with his methods, Saw bid farewell to them while they made their individual escapes before the freighter and Star Destroyer were obliterated.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Strained relationships[]\n\nGerrera's aggressive tactics including the killing of prisoners, civilians and violations of the rules of engagement created strife with members of the Rebel Alliance, whom Saw equally regarded as a source of frustration due to their focus on how the Galactic Empire would labels them and disliked their views on prioritizing while simultaneously enlisting his aid for more controversial missions. Mutually, the Rebel Alliance believed Gerrera's actions hurts them more than helps them and opined that his fatal flaw being that as a leader, Saw lacks the understanding of people valuing peace and order more than freedom and that his actions raises alarming concerns that the Rebel Alliance will replace the order the Galactic Empire represents with chaos and danger.\n\nChief among his strife with the leaders included Mon Mothma; he regarded her as weak and indecisive, though he did see fire in her, while Mothma regarded him as a war criminal and terrorist mired in cynicism. Gerrera also saw potential in Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper as effective soldiers for a mission to discover the Empire's secret superweapon. However, Gerrera's willingness to risk the lives of civilians in this quest strained his partnership with Ezra and Sabine. Ezra, who initially admired Gerrera's ability to acquire intelligence, became disillusioned with his ruthless and aggressive tactics. Gerrera believed that if a planet was lost, then there was no other option but to leave, which put him at odds with fellow Partisan Mari Kosan, who chose to stay with the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.\n\nGerrera became a mentor to Jyn Erso after she lost her parents to the Empire. Saw referred to Jyn as his daughter and taught her how to defend herself and gave her a datapad to teach herself more traditional subjects such as maths. Though Jyn ended up going on missions by the time she was fourteen, Saw was more hesitant to put her in danger and went out of his way to hide her true identity from others, including giving her a green scarf to cover up her mother's pendant. He abandoned her at the age of sixteen in order to protect her from other rebels who wanted to use her as a hostage due to her status as Galen Erso's daughter. Gerrera initially did not believe the Imperial defector Bodhi Rook's report that the Empire was building a new superweapon called the Death Star and had him tortured with a Bor Gullet. Despite his estranged relationship with Jyn, Gerrera was still able to inspire her to find the weakness in the Empire's superweapon in order to save the rebellion. Gerrera was unafraid of death and stayed behind when the Empire destroyed the Jedha Holy City.\n\nGerrera fought alongside Lux Bonteri to free their home planet of Onderon however the two often argued as Saw viewed Bonteri as more of a politician than a fighter with Saw's sister Steela working as a mediator between the two. Both where deeply saddened by her death. Following the rise of the Empire, Bonteri joined the Rebel Alliance instead of Gerrera's Partisans, which his goddaughter Maia did join. After Gerrera's death, Bonteri contacted his stepdaughter, a clerical worker loyal to the Empire, saying Gerrera's death had upset him more than he could have realized and for amnesty in exchange for surrendering to the Empire and disclosing all his information on the Rebel Alliance and their operations. She gave him a list of specific times and locations where he could turn himself in. Bonteri, however, instead used the locations to give Staven, the leader of the Dreamers, a group consisting of surviving Partisans, a supply of targets to hit.\n\nRuthless though he was, Gerrera carried several regrets throughout his life. He felt responsible for the death of his sister, Steela. Thus, he vowed to keep up his war against what he saw as evil, no matter what form his enemies took. Despite justifying his reasons for doing so, he deeply regretted abandoning Jyn Erso and leaving her on her own.\n\n",

Rather, he considered himself a patriot, believed that resistance was not the same as terrorism and found it frustrating that members of the rebellion worried about how they would be labelled being the Empire would classify them negatively regardless. He also held a strong, personal disdain for both slavery and indentured servitude, finding little difference between the two; this aversion was notable by a young Jyn Erso, believing that Saw had to have experienced a mission that made the topic a particularly sensitive topic.\n\nGerrera harbored great antipathy towards the Separatists for invading his homeworld Onderon. He also disliked the Geonosians due to their alignment with the Separatists and for building gunships which led to his sister Steela's death. This coupled by the loss of his comrades during a mission on Geonosis led him to brutally interrogate the Geonosian Klik-Klak, much to the discomfort of his former comrade Rex and the Spectres. Gerrera also disagreed with some of the Jedi's principled tactics, believing them lacking and costing them the Clone Wars.\n\nDespite his antipathy towards the Geonosians, Gerrera was horrified by the Empire's genocide against the species and believed that they had the same right to rebuild as other species. Gerrera's change of heart led him to release Klik-Klak and the Geonosian queen egg he was guarding. He also still retained greater level of respect for Jedi, acknowledging their help in the past even when wanting to dismiss them and offering Cal Kestis a place in his rebel group, acknowledging that a Jedi would aid the Partisans in their fight against the Empire. When Kestis refused because he had his own mission, Gerrera said the invitation was open, not giving up on the idea of having Kestis on the side of the Partisans. Gerrera would later enlist the help of Kestis on multiple occasions.\n\n",

Another group of remaining partisans led by Benthic remained on Jedha defending against the Imperials who returned to the moon for more kyber crystals.\n\nGerrera's old ally Bonteri eventually joined the Dreamers as \"the Mentor\" after having contacted his stepdaughter telling her that Gerrera's death had upset him more than he could have realized and asked for amnesty in exchange for surrendering to the Empire and disclosing all his information on the Rebel Alliance and their operations. She gave him a list of specific times and locations where he could turn himself in. Bonteri, however, instead used the locations to give Staven a supply of targets to hit.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Taking the fight to Jedha[]\n\nWith his campaigns against the Empire becoming increasingly brutal, Alliance High Command, at the urging of Mon Mothma, formally censured Gerrera and severed all official ties with the Partisans. By this time, Gerrera had lost his right leg and struggled to walk on a low-grade cybernetic replacement. Additionally, years spent huffing rhydonium fumes had scarred his lungs, confining him to a pressurized armor suit and requiring him to regularly take supplementary oxygen from a breath mask.\n\nHaving previously learned that the Empire's massive kyber crystal had come from Jedha, Gerrera relocated his militia to the moon, feeling that it was an appropriate place to bring his rebellion, as it was a sacred world to many different galactic religions. Due to the Imperials defiling many religious temples and artifacts in their pursuit of kyber crystals, small, local insurgent cells had begun forming in the Holy City of NiJedha in opposition to the occupation. From his new base of operations in the Catacombs of Cadera, just a half-day's walk outside the Holy City, Gerrera began recruiting and organizing the local insurgencies under the umbrella of his Partisans. During this time, he also held command over a pair of UT-60D U-wing troop transports and six T-65 X-wing fighters. Calling them the Cavern Angels, Gerrera began deploying this squadron in hit-and-run air raids against Imperial facilities in the Holy City, as well as the outlying, Imperial-controlled kyber mines.\n\nAmong the local insurgents Gerrera recruited were Guardians of the Whills Chirrut \u00cemwe and Baze Malbus, whom he enticed into joining by providing much needed provisions for the orphanage run by \u00cemwe and Malbus's friends, Kaya and Killi Gimm. Over several months, the Partisans attacked the Imperial occupiers, leading to harsher and harsher reprisals from the Empire. The Star Destroyer that had previously orbited high over Jedha descended to rest right above the Holy City, and the number of stormtroopers, tanks, and walkers on patrol in the streets increased significantly. \u00cemwe and Malbus came to Gerrera asking for assistance stealing a spacecraft so the Gimm sisters could flee the planet with their orphans. A group of Partisans, led by Beezer Fortuna, helped \u00cemwe and Malbus steal a Sentinel-class shuttle. Under the orders of Gerrera, Fortuna and the other Partisans attempted to double-cross \u00cemwe and Malbus, wishing to use the shuttle to blow up the Star Destroyer over the city. \u00cemwe and Malbus were able to talk the Partisans out of taking the shuttle, allowing the orphans to escape Jedha. However, this led to Gerrera parting ways with \u00cemwe and Malbus.\n\n",

This training afforded him skills in reconnaissance, infiltration, leadership, and knowledge in weaponry and military tactics able to contend with Separatist forces more effectively. Overtime, he also became knowledgeable in various droid model and their weaknesses. Like other Onderonian outcasts, Gerrera could also domesticate other animals such as a ruping.\n\nA battle hardened veteran during the Age of the Empire, Saw's greatest attribute was his intellect and leadership skills as a military tactician, which only improved and sharpened over time. He was an effective military commander who was adept in extracting information and launching hit-and-run raids on the Empire. Contrary to the rest of the rebels however, he was unrestrained by ethical concerns and as a result, willing to do just about anything to bring down his enemies, which caused friction with other Rebel factions. Gerrera was a feared insurgent, having had successful scores in the Arkanis sector while often leaving no survivors.\n\nIn combat, Gerrera was skilled in both armed and unarmed combat; In armed combat, he was well-versed in the usage of melee weaponry such as a staff, truncheons, and knives in addition to ranged weaponry like a blaster, snipers, and explosives. A capable hand-to-hand combatant, he was skilled enough to able to overpower both Ezra, Rex and incapacitate both stormtroopers and even death troopers.\n\nSaw later suffered severe injuries to his lungs and legs which forced him to wear a pressure suit for survival and to walk on prosthetic legs.\n\n",

As he waited, Gerrera began to tell a story from his younger days, reminiscing on his internment to a labour camp in the Onderonian jungle and the horrific conditions he faced, one of three hundred prisoners working in weather so hot they were forced to work naked. One day, everyone at the camp started to itch simultaneously, caused by a spillage of rhydonium that could be felt before being smelt. While everyone fled, Gerrera was the only one to stay, because the rhydo was 'new to [him]'. Wilmon then succeeded in arming the device, which caused rhydonium steam to begin spilling from a valve in front of them.\n\nGerrera approached the steam with glee and muttered about his love for it, causing Wilmon to react with alarm and confusion as he began huffing the rhydonium with no side effects. Gerrera could do so because he understood the rhydo, loving it like a sister and calling the burn a joy. He suspected Wilmon thought him crazy, but instead admitted that he was; revolution wasn't for the sane, but the broken and hunted like them still stand, despite knowing they won't live to see the Republic reborn. He questioned where Wilmon was at that moment, then began to howl that he was right there with Gerrera and ready to fight. Inspired by Gerrera's words, Wilmon removed his protective mask and began painfully breathing in the rhydo, fuelled by Gerrera's wild inspirations urging him to let it in. As Wilmon screamed in agony from the rhydo's burn, Gerrera cheered for him to let his newfound freedom run wild.\n\n",

Bodhi carried a message from Galen Erso, who was trying to alert the Rebellion to the nearly-completed Death Star project. However, increasingly paranoid and believing that Imperial spies were everywhere, Gerrera was convinced that the defection was a trick by the Empire. To ascertain the truth, Gerrera used a mairan named Bor Gullet to read Rook's mind, at the risk of driving him insane. Afterward, he left the catatonic Rook in a cell, before deploying his men under Benthic and Edrio to attack an Imperial kyber convoy in Jedha City. In the ensuing firefight, Rebel intelligence Captain Cassian Andor, along with Jyn Erso, were captured: both were on the moon in search of Rook, whom the Rebel Alliance had learned had a message from Galen Erso.\n\nJyn and Cassian, along with \u00cemwe and Malbus, who had been caught up in the fighting, were brought to Saw's headquarters in the Catacombs of Cadera. Saw would see only Jyn. He questioned her on why she was there, demanding to know if she was there to kill him. She told him that she was there to ask for the message from her father and when it was given to the Rebel Alliance she would be on her way. Saw asked her why she did not believe in the dream of freedom throughout the galaxy. She told him about how he abandoned her at the age of sixteen and that his war did not mean anything to her. He then showed her the message from her father which revealed the weakness in the Empire's superweapon. However, as they spoke, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Orson Krennic had resolved to test-fire the Death Star's superlaser on Jedha, having traced Bodhi there and seeing an opportunity to wipe out Saw's insurgency. A low-power shot wiped out Jedha City in an instant and created a blast wave that spread for kilometers in every direction, threatening the Catacombs. Realizing the threat, Saw released his prisoners, commending Galen's message to Jyn and begging her to save the Rebellion. However, he declared that he would \"run no longer\" and remained in the Catacombs. After seeing Jyn's party escape, his last act was to tear off his breath mask before the blast wave consumed the Catacombs, killing him. His last thoughts were for his late sister, Steela, and his last word was her name.\n\n",

        "content": "# Saw Gerrera - Onderonian hero[]\n\nIn his youth, Saw Gerrera was a hot headed soldier who was eager for leadership and considered himself a patriot of Onderon. A compassionate and charismatic man, Saw valued freedom, independence, and was a loyal follower of King Ramsis Dendup willing to fight for causes supporting them. The death of his sister, Steela, had a profound effect on Saw, sowing the seeds for the darker methods he would take up later in his lifetime.\n\nInitially, Gerrera did not understand the idea of fighting in a manner in which wins the support of people around them, a flaw in which left him dishearten for a time when his fellow rebels showcased his sister's methods as being more popular among them. Sometime after his sister's death, he'd garnered a more positive reputation, regarded as a effective soldier trained by General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex and a Onderonian planetary hero and was briefly considered a candidate for Govenor by the Galactic Empire. Although his methods were beginning to bordering extreme, Mothma noted upon meeting him for the first time, he moved with confidence akin to a chancellor or a judge and noted when accused of having no strategy by Organa, he revealed himself to be pragmatic, clever, and more concerned for public opinion than he let on, having grand plans, ambitions, and capable of working with criminal elements to achieve his goals although limited to a single-sector conflict. Fitting this image, he practiced giving speeches to inspire others to his cause.\n\nHowever, through a combinations of his own actions as well as both accounts of the Empire and from allies alike, be it true or falsified by both (the latter in other to give plausible deniability), Gerrera's image eroded overtime and leaned more into extremism. Much later in his life, only occasional flashes of his charismatic and caring attitude shined through his callous exterior.\n\n",

        "content": "# Rex - Training the Onderon rebels[]\n\nJumping behind a wall with several of the rebels, Rex opened fire on the invading droids, the first wave of which was demolished thanks to the insurgents' homemade disruptors. The next wave of enemy infantry was headed by an Armored Assault Tank, which spawned considerable devastation across the camp until Bonteri and Saw worked as a team to disable it with thermal detonators, just as Rex and his comrades had taught them. Despite several casualties, the young insurgents emerged victorious over the droids. Emboldened by their success, the rebels decided to infiltrate the capital city of Iziz, where they would bring the fight directly to King Rash and his Confederate supporters. Posing as game hunters with a dalgo-drawn caravan, Rex and the others gained access to the walled Iziz from the battle droid guards at the city gates, then split up to avoid detection. Rex accompanied Tano on her dalgo-drawn cart to find supplies for the rebels, rendezvousing with the others after nightfall.\n\nThe rebels' next course of action was to carry out a series of small-target strikes on battle droid patrols throughout Iziz. Rex helped coordinate one of the assaults, targeting a Separatist checkpoint in the city, while Skywalker, waiting with Steela on a nearby rooftop, observed their performance. After Steela sniped at the B1 battle droid manning the checkpoint, then disabled the security shield's controls with another blast, a DSD1 dwarf spider droid emerged and targeted her from street level. At that point, Rex signaled to the two soldiers accompanying him, and he watched as the insurgents used an EMP grenade to disable the dwarf spider droid. Rex, Skywalker, and the others proceeded with Tano, Kenobi, and the rebels to their safe house in Iziz to review their progress. Although Bonteri, the Gerreras, and the other rebels were proud of their growing number of successes, Kenobi and Tano\u2014who, like Skywalker, had been monitoring the strikes as well as civilian reactions\u2014voiced their concern that the local citizenry was frightened by the outbreaks of violence. While Bonteri proposed that they make a show of strength to garner public support, Rex withdrew from the safe house with Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi.\n\nThe group decided that Skywalker and Kenobi would return to Coruscant to report back to the High Council. Meanwhile, Tano would remain on Onderon as an advisor for the rebellion while also providing firsthand developments to the Council. With that, Rex left for Coruscant with Skywalker and Kenobi. After the rebels won a major victory by destroying Iziz's power generator, Rex was present at their following celebration via hologram with Skywalker and Kenobi, who offered encouragement and advice to the insurgents. In particular, Rex noted that Steela was emerging as a born leader, to which Kenobi agreed. Thanks to their training from Rex and the Jedi, the rebels were able to liberate Onderon from the Confederacy. Although Steela was elected to replace Saw as the rebel leader, she died during their decisive clash with the Separatists, becoming the final casualty in the rebellion's campaign for freedom.",
