It was nearly one meter long and was built out of heavy reinforced alloys. Its head was forged and hydraulic-assisted, and could be adjusted to fit most fasteners. It had a long handle that allowed for extra leverage on fasteners that were stuck, and its sturdy build prevented stripping, warping, and breaking. At least one Breaker was kept in the toolboxes of most field mechanics. The heavy hydrospanner could also be used as a melee weapon and cost 250 credits on the market.\n\n",

In the adventure, the player characters roleplay as agents of the Alderaanian Resistance who infiltrate the Gem of Alderaan and it is possible for the players to break up Khyyynett's tussle with Rishek. Alternatively, the players can be unsuccessful at separating the pair or to fail to intervene at all, in which case the disturbance escalates into brawl.

Most theaters had a central hologram projection unit that was capable of displaying images at a height of thirty meters tall. Core Worlds, such as Coruscant and Corulag, had public holotheaters, as did Chandrila which was the location of the Imperial Cavalcade of Stars.\n\nAround 2 BBY, smuggler Han Solo came into possession of a Brosso Mark II holoprojector. He used it to set up a makeshift holotheater in the Kamar Badlands, where he showed the only film he had access to, a holodocumentary called Varn, World of Water. Due to communication difficulties, he failed to realize that the desert dwelling Kamarian Badlanders revered water and had set up a religion around the film. When Han tried to show another film, Love is Waiting, the cultists rioted, forcing Solo and his companions to flee in the Millennium Falcon.\n\nHolotheaters could be small, and were sometimes included as a feature aboard luxury star yachts such as the GX1 Short Hauler. When Reekeene's Roughnecks modified the GX1 Short Hauler Long Shot, they removed the holotheater as it was not needed for their purposes. The Ithorian Herdship Bazaar had three holotheaters located in Isttu Village.\n\n",

        "content": "# Sim-vacation\n\nA sim-vacation, or sim-voyage, was a popular recreational activity that used simulator\nand holographic technologies to create for diverse beings a virtual reality luxury-vacation experience to beautiful tourist spots, popular throughout the galaxy. Advanced holoprojection systems created the simulated images and sound for the virtual vacationer. Some of the simulated galactic locales and attractions included the famous shooting stars of Nantama, the mountains of Belazura, and Dremulae's Sea of Translucency.\n\nSim-vacations were particularly popular on the capital world of Coruscant. A business called \"Virtual Happiness\" was, for example, one of Galactic City's several establishments specializing in sim-voyages. Ironically, after it went out of business, its original structure in the CoCo Town district served as a safe house for galactic criminal and mad scientist Jenna Zan Arbor, whose own brand of 'virtual happiness' transported another breed of virtual realist in an entirely different kind of way, through her drug, \"The Zone of Self-Containment.\"\n\n",

The ride was considered to be very safe, the bubbles well-constructed and transport ships with tractor beams stood by to rescue anyone who managed to get into trouble (i.e., by falling or sinking beneath the flow).\n\nThere was also a sport created around LavaRide, putting several riders in bubbles around the caldera and releasing an empty bubble for the riders to knock between goal posts on either end of the field. Many considered the growing sport to be too dangerous, but it did gain popularity- particularly with those interested in organizing betting pools around the game.\n\n",
