Few of its raiders are as vicious as the Tempest Runner Lourna Dee. She stays one step ahead of the Jedi Order at the helm of a vessel named after one of the deadliest monsters in the galaxy: the Lourna Dee. But no one can outrun the defenders of the High Republic forever.\n\nAfter the defeat of her crew, Lourna falls into the hands of the Jedi\u2013but not before she hides her identity, becoming just another Nihil convict. Her captors fail to understand the beast they have cornered. Just like every fool she's ever buried, their first mistake was keeping her alive.\n\nLourna is determined to make underestimating her their last.\n\nLocked onto a Republic correctional ship, she's dragged across the galaxy to repair the very damage she and her fellow Tempest Runners inflicted on it. But as Lourna plans her glorious escape, she makes alliances that grow dangerously close to friendships. Outside the Nihil\u2014separated from her infamous ship, her terrifying arsenal, and her feared name\u2014Lourna must carve her own path. But will it lead to redemption? Or will she emerge as a deadlier threat than ever before?\n\n",

When used in Cid's mine, the scan resulted in \"IPSIUM DETECTED\", followed by a list of alternate numerals.\n\nA set of credit chips in a case that Omega handed to Lanse Crowder as payment for a tree-shaped artifact, had \"845\" engraved on them in these numerals. During the exchange, Hunter was playing a game of sabacc with a Bith, with the credit chips lying on the table saying \"9 99\", using the same numbers.\n\nThe control panel in the cockpit of the Marauder displayed these numbers as Tech was teaching Omega how to fly. When Tech had to alert the rest of the team with some serious news, two lengthy chains of digits emerged on an alternate screen. The same data appeared on the screen while Tech briefed the rest of Clone Force 99 about his search through the Republic and Imperial files for information about the Advanced Science Division.\n\nAs CX-2 tracked Phee Genoa's starship, Providence, a blue monitor aboard Genoa's ship displayed a long list of Aurebesh numbers.\n\nSeveral years later, a sign over a door in the spice mines of Kessel used these numerals, reading \"D7 X371K\". They also appeared on monitors in Daiyu spaceport, and on blueprints of Fortress Inquisitorius available on the underwater stronghold's computers.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, these numerals were used in 7189, a wall mural in the Capital City of Lothal.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the numbers \"042 1792-46\" appeared on the display of a pair of binoculars used by Kes Dameron to spy on a Scarabi safe house during the rescue of Rebel Alliance leader Mon Mothma.\n\n",

The business was advertised on the chassis of R4-G77, an astromech droid owned by Hype Fazon, a racer pilot on the Colossus refueling station.\n\nDuring the war, rank insignia of the First Order utilized this system, with the numbers appearing in the insignias for sergeant (\"Ro 8\") and squad leader (\"Hal 4\"). The \"Hal 4\" insignia was worn by Lank Paze, while the \"Ro 8\" insignia could be seen on Armitage Hux's First Order monitor. When Resistance pilot Poe Dameron was communicating with General Hux over the intercom during the evacuation of D'Qar, a computer monitor aboard the Finalizer, which showed an Aurebesh transcription of Dameron's words, was filled with digits presented in this alternative format. The databank of the Libertine, which DJ gained access to after he stole the Star Yacht in Canto Bight, used these numerals to list prices in the owner's catalog of starfighters for sale.\n\nRex, an RX-Series pilot droid who provided musical entertainment i Oga's Cantina on Batuu,\nhad an inscription, \"RX24,\" on his chest, using alternative numerals.\n\n",
