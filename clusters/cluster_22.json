A fraction of that footage can be seen in the final film where Leia moves to pick up the staff before Luke tells her to point the cannon at the deck. A far off view of that full scene being filmed can be found in some behind the scenes footage. Glimpses of the scene can be found as promotional photos, one of which was adapted for a panel of the Marvel adaptation of the film.

Anakin and Obi-Wan have a brief sign language argument over what method they should use to escape, then draw their lightsabers and slice a hole in the floor. They fall down into a the Invisible Hand's fuel tank and the surrounding battle droids proceed to take aim, but the experienced Separatist commander orders his troops not to fire in order to prevent the fuel from igniting. As the two Jedi climb out of the fuel tank, B2 super battle droid attempt to follow them but are cut off when Anakin seals the exit shut. The fuel rises to an overload discharge spark gap, and the section of the ship explodes. (This scene was included in LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, but Shaak Ti is not present and the generator room is not flooded.

The pair raced along a road between the full battle of Utapau. Grievous was supposed to drive his bike through a speeding train. The scene also involved grievous driving in place to fling broken clone trooper at Kenobi and Boga. The pair drive out onto one of the massive turbines overlooking the sinkhole. Grievous drives on the spinning mechanism to make the turbine spin, creating a dividing line between the two adversaries. Grievous speaks into a comlink that he will meet with his fleet in moments. Obi-Wan then uses his lightsaber to sever the blades. However, one of the blades cuts into another turbine, which spins loose breaking the nub of their turbine off. The pair hang off another turbine below. Grievous manages to pull away, but in the process, the turbine breaks off and swings under, cutting the boom in half. Kenobi is hanging onto Grievous' bike. Grievous knocks him loose with his electrostaff, but the Jedi grabs onto a cable dragging from the vehicle. Kenobi loops it around a rock, causing the bike to break apart. The wreckage comes to rest on the landing platform where the General's starfighter is located. Grievous retrieves his blaster but he is trapped under the wreckage. Obi-Wan emerges from the darkness and spots the electrostaff sparking by the wreckage. He tries to grab it but Grievous bursts out of the wreckage and starts shooting at Kenobi. Kenobi grabs the electrostaff but Grievous flings him around and begins punching him in the face with his metal fists. However, Obi-Wan breaks free and rips out Grievous gutsack and then blasts it with the blaster. As grievous falls dead, Obi-Wan gives the body a kick and the general falls in to the pit below. This scenes was cut as it was considered too \"gory\" for a PG-13 film. Steven Spielberg oversaw the creation of the scene.\nAnakin Kills Shaak Ti \u2014 Anakin enters the meditation chamber in which Shaak Ti is concentrating and stabs her in the back, (This is the canonical version of her death and later seen in a vision to Yoda in The Clone Wars episode \"Voices\") before leaving the chamber and walking through the Jedi Temple as it is being attacked (The shot of Anakin walking was featured in the trailer, but with the background replaced with the Invisible Hand's walls).\nJedi Imposters at the Temple \u2014 When Obi-Wan and Yoda arrive at the Jedi Temple they find a group of clone troopers disguised as Jedi waiting outside. The two Jedi aren't fooled and kill them all. (This scene appears in LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game. The movie includes the second half of this scene, removing the dialogue and using CG to remove the clones' robes and give them 501st helmets.)\nYoda Communes with Qui-Gon \u2014 Qui-Gon Jinn speaks to Yoda, who names himself Qui-Gon's apprentice.

        "content": "# User:Enderdrag64/Workbench - Completed scenes released on Blu-ray[]\n\nLuke in the Desert/Tosche Station  \u2014 Luke Skywalker is in the Tatooine desert repairing a Moisture vaporator, assisted by a WED Treadwell repair droid, when he notices shining objects in the sky. Luke looks with his Macrobinoculars at two ships engaged in combat beyond the atmosphere. He jumps into his Landspeeder. The malfunctioning Treadwell blows a fuse and is unable to follow. Luke speeds off into the desert to find his friends. (This could have cut to the first film appearance of Darth Vader, although the scene is connected via circular wipe to the arrival at Tosche Station in the Blu-ray deleted scene. The next segment would follow R2-D2 and C-3PO ejecting from the Tantive IV in an escape pod.) Luke rushes into Tosche Station excitedly telling his friends about the battle above their planet. He is overjoyed to be reunited with his friend Biggs Darklighter who is on planet leave from the Academy. Camie, Fixer, and Biggs all follow Luke outside to see the battle with Luke's macrobinoculars. The battle appears to have ended and Luke's friends ridicule him for making it all up. (This scene was to come before Princess Leia being led captive before Darth Vader.) The footage has been degraded by poor film storage conditions, but was restored somewhat in the Blu-ray edition.\nReasons it was cut: The scenes were shot to humanize Luke Skywalker much earlier than in the final cut. It was removed along with subsequent scenes of Luke and his friends in Anchorhead, as it slowed the pace down. George Lucas had originally written the scenes and shot them at the suggestion of his industry friends who thought that audiences wouldn't understand the story being told from a droid's point of view. After Lucas's first screening of the rough cut of Star Wars in 1977, a fellow filmmaker jokingly accused him of producing \"American Graffiti in space.\" Upon realizing that the story was being told through the droids' perspective and it was them leading things to Luke, Lucas took the footage out.[source?]\n\n\n\nLuke and Biggs \u2014 This scene is a conversation between Luke and his oldest friend, Biggs Darklighter. Biggs has left Tatooine and is on planet leave from the Imperial Academy, where he is training to be a space pilot. Luke's envy of Biggs's success conflicts with his duty to his uncle and his reasons for remaining on Tatooine. Biggs quietly tells Luke that he has decided to join the Rebellion against the Empire. In an emotional exchange, the two young men say their farewells. (This scene was to come between the scene where C-3PO spots a distant Jawa sandcrawler in the desert and the capture of R2-D2 by Jawas in the canyon.)\nReasons it was cut: The Luke and Biggs sequence was part of the Anchorhead backstory on Tatooine and was cut along with the other early scenes on Tatooine for the same reasons.\n\n\nThe Search for Artoo \u2014 R2-D2 has absconded from his new master, Luke Skywalker. Early in the morning, Luke and Threepio rush off in the landspeeder to search for Artoo, with Threepio driving the landspeeder. They talk about Artoo, Ben Kenobi and how angry Uncle Owen is going to be. (The scene belongs at the start of the sequence where Luke and Threepio search for Artoo, before the attack of the Tusken Raiders. The moment was scored with a light version of Luke's theme; the music can be heard at the beginning of the cue \"Land of the Sand People\" on the original LP and CD configurations, or \"Landspeeder Search\" in the Special Edition album.)\nReasons it was cut: The landspeeder cockpit sequence had to be filmed against a rear-projection screen and was dropped due to poor quality.\n\n",

The only poncho scenes that made the final cut were in Docking Bay 94, on the Millennium Falcon flight from the Death Star, and the arrival on Yavin 4.\n\nAlternate establishing shot of Kenobi's hut and landspeeder parked outside, part of the Lost Cut.\nLuke decides not to replace C-3PO's restraining bolt in Kenobi's hut, from the Lost Cut. The scene appears in the film novelization.\n\nExtended dialogue between Luke and Ben inside Kenobi's hut.\nExtended conference room scene, with Cassio Tagge expressing his distrust for Darth Vader, referring to him as a \"Sith Lord\". This scene was later shown at Celebration 2017.\nObi-Wan proclaiming \"Well, there we are\" before describing Mos Eisley to Luke.\nOne long shot of the landspeeder traveling from the trooper checkpoint to the cantina, part of the Lost Cut.\nPonda Baba was originally supposed to be decapitated instead of losing his arm. Footage of his head bobbing around on the floor was shown at the Cantina Archaeology panel at Star Wars Celebration 2019. This was most likely cut due to a decapitation being more violent than a dismemberment.\nA patron of the cantina (Garouf Lafoe) leaves and reports the altercation between Obi Wan, Luke, Ponda Baba, and Dr Evazan to the stormtroopers. The camera follows him out of the cantina. In the final version in the film, he can briefly be seen just before an optical wipe and then immediately outside talking to the stormtroopers as C-3PO says, \"I don't like the look of this.\" This footage can be found on the \"Cantina Rough-Cut\" scene featured on the Blu-Ray.\nLuke is seen haggling over the price he gets for his land-speeder with Wioslea for a little longer than is shown in the film.\nJabba the Hutt confronts Han Solo at the Millennium Falcon. The original scene featured Declan Mulholland as a stand-in actor for Jabba, who was to be later replaced with an alien creature, but the technology at the time was not up to the task of creating it. In 1997, the scene was re-added in the Special Edition with Mulholland replaced by a CGI Jabba, which was enhanced upon in a later release. Additionally, Boba Fett was added in the background.\n\nExtra shots of stormtroopers searching Mos Eisley.\nA shot of a hidden gun on the Millennium Falcon shooting at stormtroopers was cut. This shot was later used in The Empire Strikes Back in the scene where Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO reach the Millennium Falcon on Hoth.\nExtended Alderaan destruction, including additional dialogue and extra shots of the Death Star Overbridge after Alderaan's destruction, featuring Leia being led away by Darth Vader.",

Leia tells him \"that's where they keep those creatures\" (the Wampas). They run off and C-3PO tears away the warning sign, hoping the troops will mistake it for another room. Sure enough, they do, and one of the snowtroopers is pulled in by a wampa. The other troopers quickly shut the door and stare in disbelief as Darth Vader walks up to them, seemingly just as confused or silently reprimanding them for stopping. (The part in which C-3PO tears off the warning sign appears in the original trailer.)\nRebel troopers attempt to fend off several wampas that have escaped their containment unit during the Battle of Hoth.\nR2-D2 wanders down a corridor and narrowly escapes a wampa.\nLuke and Leia: Medical Center \u2014 After leaving the bacta tank, Luke and Leia almost kiss but are interrupted by C-3PO. Luke tells Leia that he has to go to the Dagobah system. Leia gets angry, explaining that Han was about to leave to pay off unpaid debts for Jabba the Hutt. Leia then says that she would get more loyalty if she went down the hall and recruited some of the wampas.\n\n",

Han thanks Luke for saving him and Luke explains to his friends that he has to go back to Dagobah. (No dialogue is clearly audible.)\nJerjerrod's Conflict:\nDarth Vader Force chokes Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod in front of two Royal Guards to get into the Emperor's throne room. (Vader's lines are spoken by Prowse inside the costume.) A second shot of this scene from an alternate angle exists.\nPalpatine orders for Jerjerrod to fire the Death Star's superlaser at Endor in the event that the rebels manage to capture or otherwise deactivate the shield generator. Afterwards, upon learning of the shield's deactivation, Jerjerrod reluctantly carries out his command and gives orders to scramble fighters and open power discharge gates to flood certain sectors of the superstructure in order to prevent Red and Gold Squadrons from accessing the reactor core. These scenes were cut due to timing constraints.\nBattle of Endor: The Lost Rebels:\nB-roll footage of Rebel pilots being fed lines, with three never appearing in the film. These include a Human female pilot, a Sullustan, and a Mon Calamari pilot. The Mon Calamari eventually received an action figure, and was later made canon as Ika Sulko. Another female pilot made it into the film, but was dubbed over with a male's voice. That pilot was nonetheless later revealed to be a female named Sila Kott.\nGeneral Crix Madine sitting in the Admiral's chair aboard Home One during the final battle. These scenes were filmed in case the Admiral Ackbar puppet effects did not work properly. Actor Dermot Crowley claims to have spent a few extra days filming in a moving chair shouting things such as \"Fire!\"\nThere are cut shots of Rebel troopers rushing around aboard the Millennium Falcon making repairs, including humans and a Sullustan. Among them are Airen Cracken and Blount, who are then seen manning the Falcon's laser cannons. The Sullustan was portrayed by Richard Bonehill, who also played Nien Nunb.\n\n",

The scene was not completed as Anthony Daniels had fallen over while filming.\nExtended conversation between Padm\u00e9 and Anakin.\nWhen Obi-Wan departs for Utapau, Anakin calls out \"Master\" instead of \"Obi-Wan\".[source?]\nWookiee ambush.[source?]\nAnakin talks with Palpatine about Obi-Wan's mission to Utapau.[source?]\nPalpatine thanking Jar Jar for helping put him in power.\nExtended fight with Grievous.\nAn alternate fight sequence that includes many major changes from the final cut.\nWhen Grievous escapes on his wheel bike and Obi-Wan whistles for Boga, the Varactyl destroys a crab droid with his tail before jumping down, after which Obi-Wan destroys several Super Battle Droids before mounting the creature.\nAn extended chase, in which Grievous and Kenobi travel down a highway and hit oncoming vehicles, fly past active battlefronts, and continue through a train tunnel, which forces Grievous to at one point drive through an entire moving train, crashing into passengers.\nGrievous using his bike to spin rocks and body parts of dead clones at Obi-Wan and Boga, and later, spin a giant wind turbine to block Obi-Wan from reaching him.\nObi-Wan hanging onto a cord trailing from the wheel bike and being dragged along with it, before managing to get it caught on a rock, which breaks the wheel bike apart and sends its pieces flying into the Soulless One.\nGrievous landing several successful punches on Obi-Wan's face.\nObi-Wan tearing out the General's insides, including his heart, which he proceeds to shoot, killing Grievous, after which he kicks the body off of the landing platform.\nObi-Wan enters an Utapau Dragon Pen and selects Boga from several other Varactyls (This scene appears in the novel), and his ride to Grievous' hangar is extended.[source?]\nGrievous was originally going to try to escape in his shuttle, but Obi-Wan and Boga destroy it (This scene appears in the novel).\nAnakin and Padme have dialogue when looking out their windows.\nThe fight between Palpatine and Windu underwent many changes during production.\nPalpatine's aide Dar Wac and a pair of Senate Guards try to stop Windu and the Jedi, but are pushed with the Force out of the way before entering the Chancellor's office.\nPalpatine was originally meant to be played by a stunt double, however, George Lucas insisted that Ian McDiarmid continue to play him in order to not need to CGI his face. As McDiarmid was an older man and not as dexterous as the stunt double, the fight was slower overall.[source?]\nAnakin originally stood next to Palpatine when confronted by the Jedi. Additionally, in bonus footage on the DVD, Anakin can be seen following closely behind Windu and Palpatine as they duel down the hallway, watching them.\nAnother version of the duel consisted of Windu arriving alone, with Kit Fisto and Saesee Tiin instead dying during Order 66, and Windu dropping dead when being hit with Force lightning, rather than being launched out of the window.\nAn second angle exists of Palpatine landing in front of the Jedi Masters after jumping over his desk.\nAn alternate duel between Windu and Palpatine was shot, and for reasons unknown never released to the media, which shows Palpatine dueling using Anakin's lightsaber. A few seconds of the alternate takes were used in the final film as the hilt can be seen for the briefest moment at least once, though the blade was edited to be red. The scene is considered to be a piece of lost media, though it briefly appeared in the Revenge of The Sith deleted scene commentary through an amateur camera shot of the scene being filmed as Lucas explains it.\nWindu attempting to defend himself with his remaining hand.\nExtended Order 66 and Temple Purge.\nA completely alternate sequence features the deaths of Barriss Offee, who, while fighting on Felucia, is shot by an All Terrain Tactical Enforcer from behind, which proceeds to step on her body; Luminara Unduli, who is quickly surrounded by her troops and gunned down; and Quinlan Vos, who is riding in a convoy of HAVw A6 Juggernauts when the one in front of him suddenly stops and opens fire on his. Other differences from the final sequence include the Separatist attack on Kachirho beginning after Palpatine executes Order 66, with wookiees jumping inside the oncoming tank droids and killing their droid drivers; Ki-Adi Mundi being killed on Kamino instead of Mygeeto; Aayla Secura and Bly having dialogue; Plo Koon and his clone wingmen speaking prior to them shooting at Koon, who ejects from his starfighter but gets shot in mid air; Stass Allie noticing the clones riding with her pull back, before being fired upon; and Gree attempting to kill Yoda being replaced with Yoda witnessing Unduli's death, which is what causes him to drop his cane. Additionally, various shots of Yoda sensing the Jedi dying, along with Palaptine also sensing them, but smiling, are interlaced between the various Jedi deaths.\nUnduli and Offee's deaths were made official in the Legends comics Republic 82 and Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith 3 respectively. The latter also includes the dialogue between Secura and Bly. In Canon, Offee's fate is still unknown, while Unduli was captured and executed later, rather than being killed immediately, as revealed by Dave Filoni in an interview with IGN.\nVos' inclusion was due to the character catching George Lucas' eye in a comic. Though his appearance was ultimately cut from the movie, Lucas went on to allow Vos to survive when his fate in Legends was left up to Lucas' decision. Vos is confirmed to have also survived, in Canon, in the Obi-Wan Kenobi television series.\nAnakin enters a chamber in which Shaak Ti is meditating, only to stab her in the back with a shiak strike. Leaving the chamber, he proceeds to calmly walk through the carnage taking place in the Temple.\nTi's death was later shown in a vision to Yoda in Episode 12 of Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 6, Destiny, confirming this to be her Canon death. In Legends, however, she managed to escape and run from the Empire for many years, only to be killed by Galen Marek on Felucia in The Force Unleashed.\nExtended footage for the deaths of Whie Malreaux, Bene, and Cin Drallig, featuring more shots of Anakin dueling with the latter.\nAfter being shot down by his troops, Obi-Wan evades a Nos monster in the depths of Utapau. The Nos Monster attacks several Republic seeker droids, while Obi-Wan sneaks past some baby Nos Monsters. (\"The Nos Monster\") This scene appears in the novelization only.\nExtended footage of a pair of clones on AT-RTs examining a crashed Wookiee fighter. Yoda emerges from the wreckage as a silly creature and the two dead wookiees, revealed to be Chewbacca and Tarfful ambush the clones.

The senate guard asks them for permits, but says it is a Jedi detention order. Kenobi tricks him with the Force and says he can stay with the senator, however, later Obi-Wan and Yoda go to the Temple (This scene appears in the novelization).\nPalpatine's speech would have been longer.[source?]\nBail tries to object to the Emperor's speech but Padme stops him and assures him that there will be a time (This scene appears in the novelization).[source?]\nExtended Obi-Wan's visit with Padm\u00e9 after learning of Anakin's fall to the Dark Side (This scene appears in the novelization).\nMore scenes with Captain Typho.\nExtended Separatist Slaughter, including the Separatist Council entering the war room, Nute Gunray ducking under the conference room table, and the Neimoidian Guards along with Wat Tambor being killed by Anakin Skywalker.\nAdditionally, Rune Haako was supposed to be killed in the conference room, as seen by his body during the duel between Skywalker and Kenobi.\nAn alternate duel between Yoda and Palpatine, which was set to occur immediately after the the latter and Anakin's hologram call. During the fight, Cam droids start recording and broadcast it to large holoscreens in the ceiling of the Senate Chamber. Additionally, Palpatine uses Force lightning to blow open the roof and escape on a Senate pod, right before arriving clone troopers shoot at Yoda.\nVader levitating Padm\u00e9 in the air while choking her.\nR2-D2 and C-3PO help Padme onto her ship.\nAn extended duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin.\nAn alternate sequence with many differences from the final cut.\nAnakin wields a red lightsaber.\nExtended fighting on the piece of machinery floating down the lava river, which Anakin and Obi-Wan, at the end, jump off of at the same time.\nA \"cat and mouse\" chase using the two platforms they land on, which are shown to be pilotable by leaning in a certain direction.\nAnakin's maiming being a result of him jumping on Obi-Wan's platform, dueling, and going in for an overhead strike. Obi-Wan notices his legs are undefended and quickly slices them off, causing him to fall to the bank of the lava river below.\nAt one point, the pair were to fight along the edge of a cliff.\nObi-Wan using Anakin's lightsaber, along with his own.\nThe duo team up and fight a being known as the Mustafar Monster, which can be seen in concept art.\nThe two throw lava at each other with the Force.\nWhile lying on the bank of the lava river, Anakin was supposed to ask Kenobi for help, to which the latter declines, resulting in the former's eyes turning from blue to yellow.\nThe Naboo star skiff shown flying off from Mustafar to Polis Massa. This scene was featured in the teaser trailer.\nAdditional footage of Emperor Palpatine's shuttle leaving Mustafar and arriving on Coruscant, along with two V-wings.\nPadm\u00e9's scene of giving birth to twins would have been longer.\nDialogue between Palpatine and a surgical droid.\nDarth Vader initially had his arms raised up while on the table, however they were digitally lowered to where they are in the final film.\nVader causes a whirlwind of destruction that causes droids to break and fires to ignite.\nAn alternate version of Obi-Wan delivering Luke to the Lars Homestead, that was shot during the production of Attack of the Clones.",

        "content": "# Torture - Cloud City torture[]\n\nFor Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, director Irvin Kershner originally filmed more shots of Han Solo being tortured, which showed the machine in operation with spikes and needles and electronic things going, and flashes of electricity everywhere. It was cut because the filmmakers were afraid that this would be too intense for children. Some of Han's screaming off-screen was also taken out for the same reason. According to the director, everyone felt that the cut material was too much for a film of this type. However, a brief flashback panel in the comic issue Darth Vader (2020) 12 shows the scan grid equipped with several long sharp needles.\n\nIn the movie, Luke Skywalker has a vision of Han and Leia \"in pain\". Later, it is revealed that Darth Vader had Luke's friends tortured because he knew that their anguish would reach Luke through the Force and draw him to Bespin where he could be captured. The movie shows Chewbacca in a cell, being subjected to ear-piercing noise; the Legends novelization states that the Wookiee was subjected to sonic torture and searing lights. The movie also shows Han Solo being tortured via electricity on the scan grid, but what happened to Leia is never revealed; the princess is merely shown being pushed into the cell later and asking Han, \"Why are they doing this?\". The Legends novel Heir to the Empire states that both Han and Leia were tortured, and the Legends novel Dark Tide I: Onslaught briefly mentions that Han and Leia both went through an ordeal with a torture machine on Bespin, but does not provide any further explanation.\n\nThe canon junior novel The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi? sheds a little more light on the subject and describes what Luke sees in his vision as \"They are being tortured. Leia is screaming, her eyes bulging from her head. Han is straining, his back arched, his neck on the verge of snapping.\" Later, Luke thinks of what he saw, as \"Before your eyes are your best friends. Screaming in pain. Writhing under needles and blades, barking with fear and whimpering in horror.\"\n\n",

        "content": "# The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special - Adventures in time[]\n\nAs she holds the artifact and ponders about what it unlocks, the door begins revolving, opening a portal through space. When Rey puts down the crystal, the door closes. Rey turns the crystal, reopening the portal into a Force gateway. Rey is sucked into the Force gateway and lands in the swamps of Dagobah. There she witnesses a younger Luke Skywalker training under Yoda's tutelage while R2-D2 watches.\n\nAs part of the training, Luke has to stand upside down while he levitates Yoda and several tools. Yoda tells Luke to concentrate. Rey realizes that they have traveled back in time to when Luke was training on Dagobah under Yoda's tutelage. Rey is excited that she might learn some profound Jedi wisdom. Luke grumbles that the blood is starting to rush to his head but Yoda tells him to concentrate. Just then R2-D2 starts beeping and Luke loses his concentration.\n\nRey believes she can learn something from this. Luke tries to use the Force to lift his X-wing starfighter out of the swamps of Dagobah. Yoda tells him that there is no try. When Luke suggests that trying is a good thing, Yoda responds that participation trophies are not for Jedi. Luke tries to lift his X-wing out of the swamp but fails. Just then, BB-8 is grabbed by a swamp slug. As she struggles, Rey touches the crystal which opens the portal.\n\nThe portal takes them back to the Kordoku temple. Rey realizes that the crystal is a key to the galaxy's past that helps makes a Jedi's future clearer. Rey thinks she can train Finn by travelling back in time to watch other Jedi Masters train their students. Rey convinces a reluctant BB-8 to follow her aboard the Trade Federation battleship Saak'ak where Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi are waiting to meet the Trade Federation for negotiations during the Naboo trade dispute. Kenobi is bored but Master Jinn tells him that Jedi do not seek adventures. Just then, the Trade Federation floods the meeting room with gas. Kenobi yearns for adventure and the two ignite their lightsabers.\n\nRey and BB-8 then travel in time to Coruscant following the assassination attempt on Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. The two end up above the turbolift carrying an older Master Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Kenobi senses that Anakin is eager to see Padm\u00e9 but he reminds him that they are on a mission. Kenobi tells Skywalker that he must be completely aware of his surroundings. Rey is excited to see the older Jedi. BB-8 tries to warn her not to let them see her but the two are noticed by Kenobi and Skywalker, who ignite their lightsabers. Rey says hi before turning the crystal and opening the portal.\n\nLater, Rebel Alliance X-wings launch their attack on the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin. As Luke and R2-D2 fly their starfighter through the Death Star trench, Rey and BB-8 land in the cockpit, interrupting Luke as he is trying to aim his starfighter's cannon at the reactor shaft. Skywalker hears the Force spirit of Kenobi telling him to use the Force. Luke pushes Rey out of the way as he tries to find his targeting computer. Just then, Darth Vader strikes R2-D2 with a laser blast from his TIE Advanced x1.\n\nKenobi implores Luke to use the Force. Rey tells Skywalker to listen to his master. Meanwhile Han Solo shoots Vader's escort TIE fighters and damages Vader's TIE Advanced, causing it to spin out of control. Solo tells Skywalker to blow up the Death Star and go home. After firing a missile down the reactor shaft, Skywalker jets his starfighter out of the Death Star. The Death Star explodes. Before Skywalker can thank Rey, she travels back in time. Solo hears that over the intercom and tells Skywalker he is welcome, believing that Skywalker was referring to him. Returning to the present, Rey tells BB-8 that they helped Skywalker blow up the Death Star. Rey is excited and says this is their best Life Day ever.\n\n",

Rey travels to the planet Kordoku with BB-8 but has trouble finding the temple amidst the colored clouds.

Rey says that is different but Yoda reassures her that she can learn from failure to be a better student or better teacher. Yoda tells her that he will show her what she failed to see before showing her a Force vision of her friends celebrating Life Day aboard the Millennium Falcon.\n\nAs Rey watches, a Christmas tree topples but Finn uses his wooden blade to stop it from crashing to the ground. When Rose asks where he learned that, Finn replies that Rey taught him to be mindful of his surroundings. Yoda reassures her that Finn is wise. Rey disagrees and says that she has studied and memorized the Jedi texts. Rey realizes that by focusing too much on the books, she hurt Finn's feelings and forgot about him. Yoda says a Jedi needs knowledge and training but that these are useless without connection. Yoda shows Rey visions of various Jedi masters with their students including Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin, Yoda, and Luke. Rey realizes that these masters and students shared a friendship.\n\nYoda asks if Rey understands. Rey says yes and he wishes her a happy Life Day.

He asks if she is a Jedi and Rey confirms this is so.\n\nThe two fight over the green crystal key, causing the key to open a portal sucking them inside. BB-8 is left behind.

One of the snow troopers is confused, causing the past Lord Vader to Force choke him. The past Lord Vader orders the troops to seize the base but the future Lord Vader tells them to seize the girl. The past Lord Vader exerts his authority, prompting a lightsaber duel between the two Vaders. The two Lord Vaders size up their Force powers before realizing they are the same person. Both Vaders order their snowtroopers to destroy Rey. She manages to activate the portal and escape. The future Lord Vader and two snowtroopers follow. The past Lord Vader orders his troops to continue with their mission to seize the rebel base.\n\nOn Mustafar, Obi-Wan Kenobi and the fallen Anakin Skywalker, who becomes Darth Vader, are dueling on platforms above the lava lake.

One of the snowtroopers passes the green kyber crystal, which Rey dropped, to Lord Vader but Rey snatches it in mid-air with the Force. Rey, the future Vader, the snow troopers, Kenobi, and Anakin slide down the time portal as the lava flows down a valley.\n\nOn Nevarro, Din Djarin and Grogu shelter behind a wall as Moff Gideon's stormtroopers and Death troopers converge on them. Rey, the future Darth Vader, Kenobi, Anakin, and the two snow troopers fall through a portal. Spotting Grogu, Rey and Vader say he is so cute.

One of the snowtroopers lands in the desert while the older Anakin and Kenobi land beside the younger Anakin. Fodesinbeed Annodue says that whichever end of the universe they came from, the fall must hurt. The crystal is caught between the force field generated by Sebulba's engines, causing it to suck everyone but the stranded snowtrooper into the time portal.\n\nOn Saleucami, two clone troopers on BARC speeders complain about traffic duty and quip about thinking like the same person. Just then, the portal opens and Anakin and Sebula's podracers race past. The two clone troopers realize they don't see podracers everyday, voicing their excitement over the racers' sudden appearance in unison. They race after the podracers, sirens blaring. As Rey and Lord Vader fight, the clones catch up with them and tell them to pull over. The motion generated by Sebulba's podracer engines triggers the crystal key, which sucks everyone onto the planet Exegol.\n\nRey attempts to summon the crystal but it generates a portal on the hull of an Xyston-class Star Destroyer, sucking everyone include a group of First Order stormtroopers in with them. While falling through the portal, Rey and Lord Vader continue their duel, rapidly entering and exiting a large number of portals, gathering more and more people with them.

Rey asks where is the key. BB-8 retrieves the key and tries to roll away. However, Lord Vader uses the Force to hurl BB-8 aside and steals the green crystal. He activates the portal and departs with the mug. Rey tries to follow him but the portal closes. Rey says this is the worst Life Day ever while Luke drinks blue milk.\n\nAt the second Death Star, the Emperor spins in his chair when Lord Vader returns with the green crystal key. Vader explains that this is a key that allows them to travel through space and time. He says that he has witnessed its awesome power and believes they can use it to rule the galaxy. The Emperor however wants to go to the future where the Jedi are destroyed, the Rebellion is crushed and they reign supreme. The Emperor decides to go thirty years into the future.\n\nIn the future, the now Supreme Leader Kylo Ren is fiddling about shirtless in his chambers when General Armitage Hux stumbles on him. Hux informs him that they have send ships to head to the pectoral locations. Hux stutters before withdrawing. The Emperor grumbles about Kylo Ren being the Supreme Leader but their voices are heard by Kylo Ren, who is excited to see his grandfather and the Emperor. The Emperor tells Ren they came through a Life Day 'miracle.\" Kylo Ren is excited to see his hero but Lord Vader is unnerved by his fan art. Kylo Ren tells his guests that he just made himself Supreme Leader but the Emperor wants to know if he actually rules the galaxy in the future. Kylo Ren decides to update his guests about history but the Emperor tells him to put a shirt on.\n\nBack on Kordoku, Luke Skywalker asks where they are and who Rey is. Rey explains that she is just the Jedi Master who let Darth Vader on the loose to who knows where or when. As Rey attends to BB-8, Skywalker says that he is only a moisture farmer and has no idea who Darth Vader is but is an expert on vaporators. Seeing BB-8 damaged, Luke offers to help repair BB-8, restoring the droid. Rey is impressed with Luke's mechanical skills while Luke is curious about the spherical droid and takes an immediate liking to him.\n\nBack in the future, the Emperor learns the truth about his betrayal and death at the hands of Lord Vader during the Battle of Endor from Kylo Ren. The Emperor asks Ren for his lightsaber and toys with his cross-guard blade. The Emperor is impressed and asks Kylo Ren if he has a mask. Ren replies that he broke it, showing his Sith guests the altar where it rests. The Emperor uses the Force to repair Kylo Ren's helmet. Vader is impressed but the Emperor asks Kylo Ren if he would betray his master under any circumstances. This causes Ren to call his role in the murder of the previous Supreme Leader Snoke. Kylo Ren lies that he would not throw his master down a reactor shaft. The Emperor activates the portal with the crystal and invites Kylo Ren to change their destiny.\n\n",

Poe is followed by Rose Tico, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca. Poe mentions that Chewbacca's family is coming and that Wookiees like ripping arms off things and parties. He assigns Finn to do the decorating and asks Rey if she could help to roast the tip-yip. Rey murmurs in agreement before walking away.\n\nFrustrated with herself teaching Finn, Rey goes below deck to her personal Jedi library. Flipping through the books, Rey is frustrated that she can't train Finn despite following every teaching. Rey decides to meditate in the Force. She then feels a breeze which causes a brown Jedi book to drop. While reading the book, Rey smiles.\n\nMeanwhile, Poe tells Rose and Chewbacca that they have to prepare for Chewbacca's dinner. Rey then comes with the brown Jedi book and reads a passage telling her to visit the temple on Kordoku on Life Day where a key to the galaxy's past will help make a Jedi's future clearer. BB-8 beeps while Rose realizes this is not a tip-yip recipe. Chewbacca roars in frustration. When Finn asks what that means, Rey believes that she must go to Kordoku in order to help them with Finn's training. Finn thinks that Rey as a Jedi Master should take a break.\n\nRey says that she has to go now because today is Life Day to the dismay of the others. Rey suggests that one of them could do the tip-yip but Finn reminds her that it is about family. Poe quips that it is about the tip-yip until Rose punches him playfully. Rey promises not to miss the party while BB-8 decides to leave. D-O pleads with BB-8 not to leave but he follows Rey. D-O is lonely while Poe experiences an allergic reaction caused by the Wookiee fur and tree pollen on Kashyyyk. Dameron says that Generals don't cry and Rose adds that they lead. Poe decides to throw the greatest Life Day party in the history of the galaxy and tells them to decorate while he handles the tip-yip. Poe admits that he does not know how to roast tip-yip but dons his chef's cap.\n\n",

While the Sith Lord tries to figure out what the device is, Rey charges at him with her lightsaber. Vader uses the Force to bring down rocks, separating them. Rey however uses her Force powers to cast the rocks aside. She hurls the rocks at him but Vader deflects them with the Force and his lightsaber. He asks if she is a Jedi and Rey confirms this is so.\n\nThe two fight over the green crystal key, causing the key to open a portal sucking them inside. BB-8 is left behind. Rey and Lord Vader emerge at Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth. As the two parry, Lord Vader is impressed by Rey and says that almost feels bad about having to destroy her. Before he can finish her, the command center is struck by a laser cannon. The past Lord Vader walks into the base with a contingent of Cold weather assault stormtrooper.\n\nThe past Lord Vader and his troops encounter the future Lord Vader. One of the snow troopers is confused, causing the past Lord Vader to Force choke him. The past Lord Vader orders the troops to seize the base but the future Lord Vader tells them to seize the girl. The past Lord Vader exerts his authority, prompting a lightsaber duel between the two Vaders. The two Lord Vaders size up their Force powers before realizing they are the same person. Both Vaders order their snowtroopers to destroy Rey. She manages to activate the portal and escape. The future Lord Vader and two snowtroopers follow. The past Lord Vader orders his troops to continue with their mission to seize the rebel base.\n\nOn Mustafar, Obi-Wan Kenobi and the fallen Anakin Skywalker, who becomes Darth Vader, are dueling on platforms above the lava lake. The two snowtroopers land on a floating platform while Rey and the future Darth Vader land on separate ones and parry. One of the snowtroopers passes the green kyber crystal, which Rey dropped, to Lord Vader but Rey snatches it in mid-air with the Force. Rey, the future Vader, the snow troopers, Kenobi, and Anakin slide down the time portal as the lava flows down a valley.\n\nOn Nevarro, Din Djarin and Grogu shelter behind a wall as Moff Gideon's stormtroopers and Death troopers converge on them. Rey, the future Darth Vader, Kenobi, Anakin, and the two snow troopers fall through a portal. Spotting Grogu, Rey and Vader say he is so cute. They open a portal in the ground, taking some stormtroopers and Death troopers with them.\n\nOn Tatooine, nine-year old Anakin Skywalker races against Sebulba in podracers during the Boonta Eve Classic. Just then, the portal opens and a snowtrooper and two stormtroopers land on Sebulba's Podracer. Rey and Darth Vader land on opposite sides of the engines of Anakin's podracer. One of the snowtroopers lands in the desert while the older Anakin and Kenobi land beside the younger Anakin. Fodesinbeed Annodue says that whichever end of the universe they came from, the fall must hurt. The crystal is caught between the force field generated by Sebulba's engines, causing it to suck everyone but the stranded snowtrooper into the time portal.\n\nOn Saleucami, two clone troopers on BARC speeders complain about traffic duty and quip about thinking like the same person. Just then, the portal opens and Anakin and Sebula's podracers race past. The two clone troopers realize they don't see podracers everyday, voicing their excitement over the racers' sudden appearance in unison. They race after the podracers, sirens blaring. As Rey and Lord Vader fight, the clones catch up with them and tell them to pull over. The motion generated by Sebulba's podracer engines triggers the crystal key, which sucks everyone onto the planet Exegol.\n\nRey attempts to summon the crystal but it generates a portal on the hull of an Xyston-class Star Destroyer, sucking everyone include a group of First Order stormtroopers in with them. While falling through the portal, Rey and Lord Vader continue their duel, rapidly entering and exiting a large number of portals, gathering more and more people with them. On Tatooine, an adolescent Luke Skywalker watches the twin suns of Tatooine setting over the Lars homestead while drinking blue milk. The portal opens, dumping everyone on the desert.\n\nAs everyone gathers, three different versions of Obi-Wan Kenobi each greet each other. A legless Darth Maul clears his throat. Other people include both an older and younger Han Solo, Greedo, and numerous clone troopers, stormtroopers, First Order jet troopers and Sith troopers, among other combatants of the struggle between light and dark throughout galactic history. The two Solos agree to shoot Greedo first, and a battle commences between the forces of light and dark.\n\nRey and Lord Vader continue their fight. Lord Vader remarks that someone has trained her well. Rey remarks that he has no idea who. Just then, Luke Skywalker asks who are they. Rey recognizes him as a younger Master Skywalker while Darth Vader recognizes his son but pretends to be referring to the twin suns of Tatooine. Luke notices the green crystal key and asks what it is. When Rey and Vader charge after him, he tells them it is a private farm. The two tackle Skywalker and the three of them get sucked through a portal.\n\n",

The Emperor warns Kylo Ren not to get cold feet. Just then, a time portal appears and Rey exits. As she enters the Emperor's Throne Room, Rey calls out to Kylo Ren through his original name Ben Solo. Confused, the Emperor asks Ren who Ben is. Ren rejects his former identity and says he is Supreme Leader Kylo Ren. The younger Luke Skywalker then exits the portal, and his presence enrages his nephew. The Emperor orders Ren to kill them.\n\nRey and Kylo Ren engage in a lightsaber duel.

The Emperor attacks her with Force lightning and threatens to kill both Skywalkers, Ren, and Vader if she does not join him.\n\nVowing to rule the galaxy by himself, the Emperor steals the blue-green crystal and tries to enter the portal. Rey stops him. The Emperor dismisses her as pathetic and asks if she can think to defeat him alone. Rey responds that she is not alone.

It is analog. The Death Star marks minutes and Yavin 4 marks hours. The Death Star might be over Yavin.\nScrolling Text: Recreates the film's opening crawl. User can edit the crawl and write his or her own text. It also included a hidden message from George Lucas about his plans to release the prequel trilogy.\nSpace Battles: As seen from some window in a cruiser, small dots move against each other and shoot beams. Mon Calamari cruisers, Nebulon-B frigates and Star Destroyers drift slowly across the screen while fighters occasionally fly by.\nStoryboards: Real storyboards from A New Hope, alongside the script.\n\n",

        "content": "# Star Wars Screen Entertainment - Continuity[]\n\nSome of the information in the biographies became outdated after the release of the 1997 re-release and the prequels. It identifies Owen Lars as Obi-Wan Kenobi's brother (which originated in the Return of the Jedi novelization and has since been contradicted), and is the only source listing Beru Lars' maiden name as Beru Weth (later revealed to be Beru Whitesun). It also includes alternate names for some Mos Eisley Cantina patrons, many later revealed to be aliases in other sources.\n\nThe software's biography of Darth Vader includes details of his past that are very similar to the plot of the prequels, still years away. This is also the original source of Grand Moff Tarkin's first name, which has since become canon; it was initially spelled \"Willhuf\" in the software, though later spelled as \"Wilhuff\" in later media.\n\nIn the Jawas and Lightsaber Duel options, the images are from the video game Super Star Wars.\n\n",
