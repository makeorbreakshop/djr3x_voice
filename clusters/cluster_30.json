Belonging to an ancient settlement and formerly the original outpost, the ruins were at one time the site of a temporary Resistance encampment, which the Resistance picked largely because it had been ideal for their needs. The encampment included a DF.12 Com Turret at an entrance that led directly into the ruins and into caves which included ancient artifacts and worship sites. The Resistance built their control center inside, in some cases cutting through rock to widen the caves.\n\nSeveral Resistance recruits were once scrambled there alongside BB-8 to their fighters. Prior to a space battle with the First Order, a group of recruits departed from the ruins on a mission in a transport before the vessel's capture and eventual escape from a Star Destroyer.\n\n",

During or after that year, the safari droid SF-R3 visited Batuu in order to learn about the porgs and attempt to teach them tricks. While hiking up a mountain to get to them, his cam droid, CAM, ran into one of the bears in a cave, but the droid was able to quickly escape.\n\nLater, while trying to train a trio of porgs to play dead, a Batuuan braga bear approached, causing the porgs to fly away in fright and leaving the droids by themselves. They too ran away, with SF-R3 begging the bear to not eat him. When recounting his adventures on Batuu for a holorecording for the Galactic Society of Creature Enthusiasts, the droid noted that while he intended to be the teacher on the planet, he ended up learning a lesson: to run when a braga bear's growl was heard. As he recorded the segment, a bear again chased after him, causing him to flee again.\n\n",

Batuu's surface was covered in jungles, oceans, and the petrified remains of ancient trees, referred to by the local Batuuans as \"spires,\" which towered over the planet's landscapes. Millennia before the rise of the Galactic Empire and prior to the invention of hyperspace travel, Batuu was a popular stopping point for those traveling to Wild Space and the Unknown Regions. However, the opening of hyperspace routes caused the planet to be bypassed, resulting in the deterioration of the planet's reputation into that of a forgotten backwater world.\n\nThe largest settlement on the planet was the ancient trading post Black Spire Outpost. By the time of the war between the Resistance and the First Order, the outpost had devolved into a seedy smuggler's haven run by the intimidating Blutopian Oga Garra. The world was also home to farming communities, such as Peka and Surabat, and the town of Galma, known for its mechanics.\n\n",

Belonging to an ancient settlement and formerly the original outpost, the ruins were at one time the site of a temporary Resistance encampment, which the Resistance picked largely because it had been ideal for their needs. The encampment included a DF.12 Com Turret at an entrance that led directly into the ruins and into caves which included ancient artifacts and worship sites. The Resistance built their control center inside, in some cases cutting through rock to widen the caves.\n\nSeveral Resistance recruits were once scrambled there alongside BB-8 to their fighters. Prior to a space battle with the First Order, a group of recruits departed from the ruins on a mission in a transport before the vessel's capture and eventual escape from a Star Destroyer.\n\n",
