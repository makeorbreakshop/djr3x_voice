The apparent protagonist wore a broad-brimmed white hat, while the antagonist wore a similar black hat. A third character wore a colorful feathered headdress. The storyline of one episode involved the R2 unit with the white hat fighting the R2 unit with the black hat, and later smoking a pipe with the unit wearing the feathered headdress.\n\nThough the program was R2-centric, it was also popular among non-astromechs. C-3PO once suggested watching the program with Kea Moll in order to relax. Vlix Oncard also enjoyed the program.\n\n",

The \"BD\" in the droid's name was derived from \"Buddy Droid,\" Respawn's internal nickname for the character. Sound designer Ben Burtt provided the audio for BD-1's voice.\n\nOn November 12, 2019, the Star Wars Legends massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic announced RE-1, a droid mini-pet for players that was inspired by BD-1 and the then-upcoming release of Fallen Order. RE-1 was derived from a piece of Lamarre-Wan's early concept art for BD-1 in order to ensure that its design was influenced by Fallen Order's character while also fitting within the Old Republic era. An additional droid based on BD-1, the JR-4 Recon Droid, was released for the game in 2023 to celebrate the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\n\n",
