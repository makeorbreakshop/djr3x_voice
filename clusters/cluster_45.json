They were stopped by a guardian who they quickly stunned. Quadoro questioned Captain Ohnaka on why he has to be in the front, to which he was quickly gunned down by more guardians. While Hondo continued to fight the guardians, Dok-Ondar located their target and began to admire the history of it. He felt that it brought him closer to his parents. Dok-Ondar used a laser torch to break off the statue from the rest of it's base but the lasers deflected off and shot to the ceiling which caused part of the ceiling to fall and take a guardian Hondo was fighting with it. Dok-Ondar used Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber instead to break off the statue. After doing so, Hondo quickly grabbed the Ithorian and they made their way to the exit. They were stopped by another guardian, this one introduced himself as Chirrut \u00cemwe and refused to let them pass by. Hondo underestimated the blind man and started to shoot at him. Chirrut dodged the blaster fire and knocked out Hondo. Hondo got back up and started to duel Chirrut with his own staff. Dok-Ondar intervened and stated that this statue was a clue to figuring out the murder of his parents. Chirrut let them go and the two returned to the ship.\n\nAs they left they were spotted a Imperial starfighter who was on patrol. Hondo started to fly toward the Star Destroyer over head stating that the starfighters will not fire on their own ship. As he flew closer to the ship, he took off into hyperspace.\n\n",

While shooting at Remex as stray bullet hit a Zeltron, killing him. The stormtroopers have an arrest warrant on Remex and were told to take him in alive until Remex started to shot back at them, killing one of them. Remex changed his form to a human sitting on the street. When asked where Remex went, he told the stormtroopers that he ran toward the spaceport. After changing back to his regular form, Remex was quickly grabbed by the throat and by Varg, Dok-Ondar's \"fixer\". Varg said he was here fix a big problem for Dok-Ondar.\n\nShortly after at Oga's Cantina, Remex managed to meet up with Kendoh Voss and Wooro. Remex told Kendoh that Dok-Ondar had found out about the heist and they must abort the plan. Kendoh told Remex that they are still going forward with the plan and walked over to a booth to go meet with a fortune teller. The fortune teller told the person in the booth behind them all about Kendoh and her gang. The person asked Kendoh to go over to him and introduced himself as the Weequay pirate, Hondo Ohnaka. Kendoh says they need a pilot who can make a run through a First Order blockade. Back at the bar, Remex was skeptical about hiring Hondo as their pilot. But Wooro told him it was all part of their ploy. At the booth, Hondo reassures Kendoh that he is the right person for the job and mentioned a job that he and Dok-Ondar took and escaped the Guardians of the Whills and escaped an Imperial blockade. At another location, Dok-Ondar is holding a recording of Hondo talking to Kendoh, and he told Hondo to just try to get Kendoh to pump information about her plan.\n\n",

Dok-Ondar was disappointed with how late the crew was, due to the First Order's arrival and Io needing to take a longer route through an alley. While there, the other member of Voss' crew, Wooro, noticed an infant sarlacc. Dok-Ondar told him the story of Solo smuggling them in from a reserve on I'vorcia Prime, but Voss immediately got to showing Dok-Ondar what she wants to sell him. When Dok-Ondar saw what was on the screen, a lightsaber, he asked them to leave immediately. His assistant asked him how that weapon could have been retrieved, and Dok-Ondar wanted to make sure it did not fall into the wrong hands.\n\nLater, the First Order arrived at Dok-Ondar's place to investigate the lightsaber that he owned. A stormtrooper sergeant threatened Dok-Ondar, saying all of his items could be reclassified as contraband and destroyed and also noting that owning a lightsaber could once again be a crime. When the stormtroopers left, Dok-Ondar noted to his assistant and translator Tohago that he planned to move the hilt of the sword to a safe location to prevent the First Order from discovering it.\n\nLater, Dok-Ondar sent his Clawdite enforcer Varg to intercept Io. Varg incapacitated Io and impersonated him to get on the inside of the Kendooh Gang. Then, Dok-Ondar listened in on a conversation between Voss and Hondo Ohnaka, who he was in league with. Voss revealed part of her plan to Ohnaka, trying to hire him as a pilot, unaware of his ties with Dok-Ondar. However, when Voss showed Ohnaka what the cargo was, the Sword of Khashyun, Dok-Ondar was furious to see Ohnaka reveal his knowledge of the sword to Voss.\n\nOhnaka made his way to Dok-Ondar to inform him of what he knew, but when he began to babble loudly in the street, Dok-Ondar angrily silenced him, warning him of the amount of spies in the area. Bringing him inside, Ohnaka told him what he knew, unaware that they were being spied on by a cam droid operated by the Kendoh Gang. Dok-Ondar explained the mission he and Aphra undertook on Moraband to Ohnaka, and when Ohnaka asked for more details, Dok-Ondar told him that they could talk more at the safe house, expressing his desire to move the hilt to Ohnaka's ship before it could be stolen. Just then, Voss and Wooro entered the den to steal the hilt. However, Dok-Ondar activated his primary security droid BK-86, but at the same time, a group of stormtroopers formed outside.\n\nThe stormtroopers entered, aiming their blasters at Dok-Ondar, Tohago, BK-86, Voss, and Wooro. After the stormtroopers beat Wooro and hit Voss on the chin with a blaster, they questioned Voss about her intentions on Batuu, believing her to be with the Resistance. Then, Voss improvised, eventually passing off the hilt to Wooro, who would unknowingly give it to Varg, thinking he was Io. Varg returned the hilt to Dok-Ondar, who then contacted Voss via hologram to reveal he was the benefactor that had hired them. Dok-Ondar told them that he could not afford to let them sell the blade and instead tried to unite the two pieces. As he succeeded in doing so, he told the crew that their payment was leaving the planet safely, saying he gave the First Order an anonymous tip regarding their location that would give them enough time to escape.\n\n",

One such being was the Weequay smuggler Hondo Ohnaka, who brought the modified YT-1300 light freighter named the Millennium Falcon to the outpost and established Ohnaka Transport Solutions, a shipping company that was a front for his smuggling operations. Based out of Docking Bay 5, the company frequently recruited flight crew members among the outpost's new arrivals.\n\nThe human mercenary Bazine Netal had been hired to search for the Millennium Falcon and purchase it from whomever had it in their possession. At Oga's Cantina, the smuggler told her stories of his history with the ship to stall for time as a Yarkoran sabacc player secretly contacted Mahjo Reeloo, who owed Ohnaka a favor after an incident in the Undervaults of Gwongdeen. Netal paid Ohnaka for the Falcon and delivered it to Beixander 9, where Reeloo posed as Netal's contact to accept delivery of the ship before returning it to the outpost. Ohnaka notified Chewbacca, a Wookiee and the ship's former co-pilot, that the Falcon was safe from Netal's employers. Though Ohnaka continued to use it for his business, he also expressed certainty that the ship would continue to aid \"the good guys.\"\n\nAncient ruins just outside of the outpost housed a Resistance base around that same time. Eventually, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren arrived at the outpost and took command of the First Order garrison, having learned that Rey was with a group of Resistance fugitives on Batuu.

While in search of tools to purchase for Kami's master, Carver Drow, the group found property developer Ozon Nimbee presenting to Black Spire residents on potential developments. Nimbee sought to construct buildings with unobstructed views of the Batuuan skies, which would necessitate cutting down very spires central to the outpost's identity. Despite of the refusal of the outpost residents, Nimbee tested using sabotage droids to cut down several spires near the outpost. The Jedi, witnessing the test, confronted Nimbee, who was berated by the townsfolk. Believing the only way to get buy-in for his plans was to cut down the spires within the outpost without permission, Nimbee released a swarm of his buzz droids on Black Spire Outpost. The Jedi and townsfolk fought the swarm of droids, destroying many of them. Soon, Drow arrived to destroy several more with his lightsaber and the Force. One droid, however, escaped notice before completely transecting the spire overlooking the milk stand. As the upper portion of the enormous spire fell, the Jedi used the Force to prevent it from crushing the milk stand and set it gently on the ground nearby. At some point, the fallen spire was placed upon its base once more, leaving behind the evidence of the clean cut. Following the defeat of Nimbee, Drow decided to promote relations with the local residents.\n\nTo foster friendly relations with the residents of Black Spire Outpost, the Jedi hosted at least two public training days outside the Temple. During a later visit to Batuu, Brightstar duelled with Master Drow during a public training day but experienced fears and doubts. At the advice of Drow, Brightstar later retreated to a cave where he experienced Force visions which helped him to overcome his doubts and insecurity. Following a second public training day, local girl Sadie Bolter stole Lys's lightsaber in order to overcome her own insecurities. However, the lightsaber was stolen by the local bully Pak Relda. Seeking to make amends with Solay and her friends, Bolter helped the Jedi to recover Lys's lightsaber and defeated Relda in a sword duel.\n\nLater, the Jedi Order abandoned the Batuu Jedi Temple after the facility was contaminated by an ancient Sith runestone, that claimed the lives of several Jedi including Master Sylwin. The sole survivor was Padawan Ady Sun'Zee. In response Master Yoda sealed the Batuu Temple with The Force, declaring it lost.\n\n",

The father died during a supply run accident leaving his wife and four children to run a grain farm.\n\nOne day while the four children were playing by edge of the Surabat River Valley Anya's brother went missing. The girls searched for their brother until dusk but they could not find him. They eventually went home hoping that he was there but he was not. Anya's Mother had warn the children not to play by the valley but had not told them that it was because the slaver Sampa Grott would sometimes abduct people from the valley and put them to work. Knowing that her son was lost forever Anya's mother fell into despair.\n\nHowever the girls still had hope and the next morning Anya's oldest sister left for Black Spire Outpost armed with her late father's farming sickle to search for her brother. That night having not returned it seemed that the oldest sister had also be captured by the slavers and the mom fell deeper into despair. The next morning however the middle sister made the decision to leave to search for both her brother and sister. Leaving Anya to look after their mother the girl left armed with her late father's blaster. But that sister did not return. Anya not able to endure her mother's cries fled into the goods and began to sob.\n\nA robed man, having heard the crying and wishing to help, approached Anya in the woods. Initially afraid of the man, thinking he might be another slaver, Anya eventually told him how she lost her siblings. After hearing the tale the man encouraged Anya to go after her siblings believing she was the only one that could save them. Since Anya did not have a weapon the stranger fashioned a small wooden dagger from a fallen branch. After that the man disappeared into the woods.\n\nThe next morning Anya left for Black Spire Outpost armed with her dagger. Eventually while searching the Outpost Anya over heard a Gran and a Ithorian talking about Sampa Grott. The Gran has recently been tricked by Sampa and was about to head over to Sampa to confront him. Anya followed the Gran to the hidden junkyard, Sampa's Cradle. Once there she seeing that Sampa Grott was big brutal man that could not have been easily beaten in a fight Anya decided she had to come up with a more clever plan to save her siblings.\n\nAnya found Sampa's house and hid under his bed and waited for him to return home. After Sampa fell asleep Anya crept up and put her wooden dagger to his throat. Feeling the tip of the dagger, Sampa's eyes opened but did not move fearing that his throat would be cut. Anya having disguised her voice told Sampa that she was an assassin and was sent to kill him. Sampa begged for his life and Anya told him if she released the three children she would let him live. Sampa quickly agreed and Anya left the house and headed home. The next morning her bother and two sisters had both been returned. Sampa was rumored to have fled into Wild Space where his enemies couldn't find him.\n\n",

Dok-Ondar shot at Aphra and split the sword in half. As he tried to reclaim the sword, which was now stuck in the ground, he noticed 0-0-0 rebooting and decided to take what he could, claiming one half and leaving Aphra the other half. Dok-Ondar left her and her droids stranded on Moraband. He deeply regretted splitting the sword in half.\n\n",

He said that long before the Clone Wars, the Jedi set up a temple to research dark artifacts on Batuu. One day, Jedi Master Sylwin and her padawan, Ady Sun'Zee found one of these Dark Relic, and brought it back to the Temple for research. But the relic was powerful, and turned them all against each other. Master Sylein put up a fight, but was lost. Ady hit the distress beacon to warn the council, and blacked out. When she came to, she was in the Temple, and was being attacked by Demlins that were corrupted by the artifact. She held her own, using her Lightsaber Master Yoda appears. He had gotten wind of the distress beacon, and had come to help. Master Yoda said that it had been three days since the distress call was sent. Yoda then went alone to contain the relic. Despite Master Yoda's Orders, Ady followed him into the Temple. The security system in the Temple activated, and Ady battled more demlins, and security droids, and when finished, Ady resumed her search for the Artifact. She found a fake version, and when she touched it, it glowed red, and created vines all over the Temple. Ady used her lightsaber to cut her way through, until she found the real artifact. Ady grabbed it, and heard master Sylwins voice telling her that she would never be a Jedi. Ady cut her way through more vines, until she arrives in a room with master Yoda calmly, sitting down. Master Yoda tells her that it was her fault, and under the influence of the artifact, she killed everyone in the Temple. Demlins then emerged from the floor, and dragged Master Yoda down into a Chasm, while Ady's lightsaber failed to work. The walls were ripped away to reveal a swirling storm of red clouds and rock. Ady fought more and more demlins, until she heard Master Yoda's voice telling her that her weapon was not needed. Ady placed her Lightsaber on the glowing white pedestal, and everything went black. Ady woke up to Master Yoda using The Force to fight against the artifact, and she saw he was being overpowered. Yoda asked Ady for help, and together, they contained the artifact. Yoda sealed of the Temple, and reassured Ady that she can fight the Darkness within her. Seezelslak then finished his tale by saying that Ady hid the keys to the Temple somewhere on Batuu.\n\n",

Meanwhile, Dolin is met by Ylena who brings blasters from Savi's, and by many young people from his settlement who decided to join the cause after the First Order killed two villagers. When Dolin is signaled, the group rushes the transport to further distract Kath and his troops while Kriki works inside the transport; however, they only take down a few while incurring heavy losses as they are not trained soldiers. Just when everything seems lost, a man in red-painted stormtrooper's armor and a black cape emerges from the clearing. It is Archex dressed as his former identity, Captain Cardinal.\n\nArchex offers himself as Kath's prisoner, knowing Kath will not leave the planet unless he has something to give his superiors. Kriki has succeeded; after the ship departs with Kath and Archex on board, the message is sent and the ship explodes. A week later, a fully-recovered Moradi meets with Garra, who provides Moradi with a long range comms array as thanks for getting rid of the First Order. Moradi notified Organa that the base has been established and she can start using it as a fleet waypoint.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Moradi is training her many new recruits when she receives an alert from the Resistance that Kylo Ren and the 709th Legion are en route.

Before General Leia Organa leaves for Takodana, she gives Vi Moradi a new mission: to establish a new Resistance outpost on the planet Moradi has identified, and to bring Archex\u2014the former Cardinal\u2014to assist her. Before Moradi can depart for Batuu the next day, Organa transmits an announcement that Hosnian Prime and the Hosnian system have been destroyed by the First Order. Moradi's mission is put on hold.\n\nFour months after the Battle of Crait, Moradi's mission is back on. Alongside the PK-Ultra worker droid Pook, she picks up Archex from his enforced healing retreat on Cerea and they journey to Batuu. Their starship is caught in a skirmish between two smuggler ships upon arrival and they are forced to crash land in the forest. While unconscious, their ship is ransacked by the crew of the local crime boss, Oga Garra. A local Batuuan woman, Salju, find them and offers assistance. She gives Moradi a tour of Black Spire Outpost and gets her a job at Savi & Son Salvage to earn money to buy back her own equipment to establish a Resistance base. Through her new work, Moradi meets Ylena and Savi's Gatherers, but fails to recruit them to the Resistance. Due to limited mobility resulting from wounds inflicted by Phasma, Archex must remain hidden in the forest, leaving him feeling useless.\n\nMoradi is taken by one of Garra's enforcers to meet the crime boss within her cantina. Garra tells her that if she locates an artifact within the ruins and brings it back to Garra, Moradi can have her property back. Moradi secures Garra's agreement that the Resistance may also use the ruins as a base. Meanwhile, the First Order is alerted to the Resistance presence on Batuu, and General Hux dispatches Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath and twenty stormtroopers to inspect the world. Kath has a vendetta against Moradi and Archex after failing to prevent their escape from the Absolution.\n\nGarra offers to tell Kath of the Resistance if Kath brings her the artifact in the ruins. Kath and two troopers enter the ruins, following Moradi as she negotiates the ancient security measures. Two troopers are downed by Vi, though the latter becomes poisoned. Moradi is rescued by a farm boy named Dolin and his truffleboar Waba. Dolin brings him to his grandmother Grana and they nurse her back to health, but when Moradi persuades Dolin to join the Resistance, Grana rejects her grandson.\n\nMoradi gives the artifact to Garra and regains most of her property except her long range comm array, which is what she needs most to update General Organa of her situation. The next day, Moradi goes into town to buy a comm array and defends a Chadra-Fan named Kriki who is being mistreated by her employer. Kriki chooses to join the Resistance, helping Moradi with her errands and fixing up the new base within the ruins, the layout of which is being planned by Archex. Later on, Moradi recruits a drunken but charismatic loudmouth named Zade Kalliday, who helps manage the recruitment of Resistance personnel. Soon after, while Moradi is picking up lunch, she witnesses stormtroopers harassing two old women seeking information on Moradi. When she defends the women, she is overwhelmed by the two troopers, who take her prisoner.\n\nAfter undergoing torture by Kath, Moradi is rescued by her new companions. By then, multiple stormtroopers have been killed, leaving only twelve. Moradi and her three recruits make a plan to get the First Order to leave Batuu despite being outnumbered. She uses a stolen First Order comm link to tap into their network and send out a message to the Resistance, requesting that Organa send supplies and personnel, but Organa informs her that none are available and she has faith in Moradi. Dolin also goes back to his village to recruit for the upcoming attack, but his grandmother disowns him. Having no other options, the group proceeds with their plan.",

They were stopped by a guardian who they quickly stunned. Quadoro questioned Captain Ohnaka on why he has to be in the front, to which he was quickly gunned down by more guardians. While Hondo continued to fight the guardians, Dok-Ondar located their target and began to admire the history of it. He felt that it brought him closer to his parents. Dok-Ondar used a laser torch to break off the statue from the rest of it's base but the lasers deflected off and shot to the ceiling which caused part of the ceiling to fall and take a guardian Hondo was fighting with it. Dok-Ondar used Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber instead to break off the statue. After doing so, Hondo quickly grabbed the Ithorian and they made their way to the exit. They were stopped by another guardian, this one introduced himself as Chirrut \u00cemwe and refused to let them pass by. Hondo underestimated the blind man and started to shoot at him. Chirrut dodged the blaster fire and knocked out Hondo. Hondo got back up and started to duel Chirrut with his own staff. Dok-Ondar intervened and stated that this statue was a clue to figuring out the murder of his parents. Chirrut let them go and the two returned to the ship.\n\nAs they left they were spotted a Imperial starfighter who was on patrol. Hondo started to fly toward the Star Destroyer over head stating that the starfighters will not fire on their own ship. As he flew closer to the ship, he took off into hyperspace.\n\n",

Varg said he was here fix a big problem for Dok-Ondar.\n\nShortly after at Oga's Cantina, Remex managed to meet up with Kendoh Voss and Wooro. Remex told Kendoh that Dok-Ondar had found out about the heist and they must abort the plan. Kendoh told Remex that they are still going forward with the plan and walked over to a booth to go meet with a fortune teller. The fortune teller told the person in the booth behind them all about Kendoh and her gang. The person asked Kendoh to go over to him and introduced himself as the Weequay pirate, Hondo Ohnaka. Kendoh says they need a pilot who can make a run through a First Order blockade. Back at the bar, Remex was skeptical about hiring Hondo as their pilot. But Wooro told him it was all part of their ploy. At the booth, Hondo reassures Kendoh that he is the right person for the job and mentioned a job that he and Dok-Ondar took and escaped the Guardians of the Whills and escaped an Imperial blockade. At another location, Dok-Ondar is holding a recording of Hondo talking to Kendoh, and he told Hondo to just try to get Kendoh to pump information about her plan.\n\n",

The father died during a supply run accident leaving his wife and four children to run a grain farm.\n\nOne day while the four children were playing by edge of the Surabat River Valley Anya's brother went missing. The girls searched for their brother until dusk but they could not find him. They eventually went home hoping that he was there but he was not. Anya's Mother had warn the children not to play by the valley but had not told them that it was because the slaver Sampa Grott would sometimes abduct people from the valley and put them to work. Knowing that her son was lost forever Anya's mother fell into despair.\n\nHowever the girls still had hope and the next morning Anya's oldest sister left for Black Spire Outpost armed with her late father's farming sickle to search for her brother. That night having not returned it seemed that the oldest sister had also be captured by the slavers and the mom fell deeper into despair. The next morning however the middle sister made the decision to leave to search for both her brother and sister. Leaving Anya to look after their mother the girl left armed with her late father's blaster. But that sister did not return. Anya not able to endure her mother's cries fled into the goods and began to sob.\n\nA robed man, having heard the crying and wishing to help, approached Anya in the woods. Initially afraid of the man, thinking he might be another slaver, Anya eventually told him how she lost her siblings. After hearing the tale the man encouraged Anya to go after her siblings believing she was the only one that could save them. Since Anya did not have a weapon the stranger fashioned a small wooden dagger from a fallen branch. After that the man disappeared into the woods.\n\nThe next morning Anya left for Black Spire Outpost armed with her dagger. Eventually while searching the Outpost Anya over heard a Gran and a Ithorian talking about Sampa Grott. The Gran has recently been tricked by Sampa and was about to head over to Sampa to confront him. Anya followed the Gran to the hidden junkyard, Sampa's Cradle. Once there she seeing that Sampa Grott was big brutal man that could not have been easily beaten in a fight Anya decided she had to come up with a more clever plan to save her siblings.\n\nAnya found Sampa's house and hid under his bed and waited for him to return home. After Sampa fell asleep Anya crept up and put her wooden dagger to his throat. Feeling the tip of the dagger, Sampa's eyes opened but did not move fearing that his throat would be cut. Anya having disguised her voice told Sampa that she was an assassin and was sent to kill him. Sampa begged for his life and Anya told him if she released the three children she would let him live. Sampa quickly agreed and Anya left the house and headed home. The next morning her bother and two sisters had both been returned. Sampa was rumored to have fled into Wild Space where his enemies couldn't find him.\n\n",

Dok-Ondar was disappointed with how late the crew was, due to the First Order's arrival and Io needing to take a longer route through an alley. While there, the other member of Voss' crew, Wooro, noticed an infant sarlacc. Dok-Ondar told him the story of Solo smuggling them in from a reserve on I'vorcia Prime, but Voss immediately got to showing Dok-Ondar what she wants to sell him. When Dok-Ondar saw what was on the screen, a lightsaber, he asked them to leave immediately. His assistant asked him how that weapon could have been retrieved, and Dok-Ondar wanted to make sure it did not fall into the wrong hands.\n\nLater, the First Order arrived at Dok-Ondar's place to investigate the lightsaber that he owned. A stormtrooper sergeant threatened Dok-Ondar, saying all of his items could be reclassified as contraband and destroyed and also noting that owning a lightsaber could once again be a crime. When the stormtroopers left, Dok-Ondar noted to his assistant and translator Tohago that he planned to move the hilt of the sword to a safe location to prevent the First Order from discovering it.\n\nLater, Dok-Ondar sent his Clawdite enforcer Varg to intercept Io. Varg incapacitated Io and impersonated him to get on the inside of the Kendooh Gang. Then, Dok-Ondar listened in on a conversation between Voss and Hondo Ohnaka, who he was in league with. Voss revealed part of her plan to Ohnaka, trying to hire him as a pilot, unaware of his ties with Dok-Ondar. However, when Voss showed Ohnaka what the cargo was, the Sword of Khashyun, Dok-Ondar was furious to see Ohnaka reveal his knowledge of the sword to Voss.\n\nOhnaka made his way to Dok-Ondar to inform him of what he knew, but when he began to babble loudly in the street, Dok-Ondar angrily silenced him, warning him of the amount of spies in the area. Bringing him inside, Ohnaka told him what he knew, unaware that they were being spied on by a cam droid operated by the Kendoh Gang. Dok-Ondar explained the mission he and Aphra undertook on Moraband to Ohnaka, and when Ohnaka asked for more details, Dok-Ondar told him that they could talk more at the safe house, expressing his desire to move the hilt to Ohnaka's ship before it could be stolen. Just then, Voss and Wooro entered the den to steal the hilt. However, Dok-Ondar activated his primary security droid BK-86, but at the same time, a group of stormtroopers formed outside.\n\nThe stormtroopers entered, aiming their blasters at Dok-Ondar, Tohago, BK-86, Voss, and Wooro. After the stormtroopers beat Wooro and hit Voss on the chin with a blaster, they questioned Voss about her intentions on Batuu, believing her to be with the Resistance. Then, Voss improvised, eventually passing off the hilt to Wooro, who would unknowingly give it to Varg, thinking he was Io. Varg returned the hilt to Dok-Ondar, who then contacted Voss via hologram to reveal he was the benefactor that had hired them. Dok-Ondar told them that he could not afford to let them sell the blade and instead tried to unite the two pieces. As he succeeded in doing so, he told the crew that their payment was leaving the planet safely, saying he gave the First Order an anonymous tip regarding their location that would give them enough time to escape.\n\n",

He said that long before the Clone Wars, the Jedi set up a temple to research dark artifacts on Batuu. One day, Jedi Master Sylwin and her padawan, Ady Sun'Zee found one of these Dark Relic, and brought it back to the Temple for research. But the relic was powerful, and turned them all against each other. Master Sylein put up a fight, but was lost. Ady hit the distress beacon to warn the council, and blacked out. When she came to, she was in the Temple, and was being attacked by Demlins that were corrupted by the artifact. She held her own, using her Lightsaber Master Yoda appears. He had gotten wind of the distress beacon, and had come to help. Master Yoda said that it had been three days since the distress call was sent. Yoda then went alone to contain the relic. Despite Master Yoda's Orders, Ady followed him into the Temple. The security system in the Temple activated, and Ady battled more demlins, and security droids, and when finished, Ady resumed her search for the Artifact. She found a fake version, and when she touched it, it glowed red, and created vines all over the Temple. Ady used her lightsaber to cut her way through, until she found the real artifact. Ady grabbed it, and heard master Sylwins voice telling her that she would never be a Jedi. Ady cut her way through more vines, until she arrives in a room with master Yoda calmly, sitting down. Master Yoda tells her that it was her fault, and under the influence of the artifact, she killed everyone in the Temple. Demlins then emerged from the floor, and dragged Master Yoda down into a Chasm, while Ady's lightsaber failed to work. The walls were ripped away to reveal a swirling storm of red clouds and rock. Ady fought more and more demlins, until she heard Master Yoda's voice telling her that her weapon was not needed. Ady placed her Lightsaber on the glowing white pedestal, and everything went black. Ady woke up to Master Yoda using The Force to fight against the artifact, and she saw he was being overpowered. Yoda asked Ady for help, and together, they contained the artifact. Yoda sealed of the Temple, and reassured Ady that she can fight the Darkness within her. Seezelslak then finished his tale by saying that Ady hid the keys to the Temple somewhere on Batuu.\n\n",

The stormtroopers have an arrest warrant on Remex and were told to take him in alive until Remex started to shot back at them, killing one of them. Remex changed his form to a human sitting on the street. When asked where Remex went, he told the stormtroopers that he ran toward the spaceport. After changing back to his regular form, Remex was quickly grabbed by the throat and by Varg, Dok-Ondar's \"fixer\". Varg said he was here fix a big problem for Dok-Ondar.\n\nShortly after at Oga's Cantina, Remex managed to meet up with Kendoh Voss and Wooro. Remex told Kendoh that Dok-Ondar had found out about the heist and they must abort the plan. Kendoh told Remex that they are still going forward with the plan and walked over to a booth to go meet with a fortune teller. The fortune teller told the person in the booth behind them all about Kendoh and her gang. The person asked Kendoh to go over to him and introduced himself as the Weequay pirate, Hondo Ohnaka. Kendoh says they need a pilot who can make a run through a First Order blockade. Back at the bar, Remex was skeptical about hiring Hondo as their pilot. But Wooro told him it was all part of their ploy. At the booth, Hondo reassures Kendoh that he is the right person for the job and mentioned a job that he and Dok-Ondar took and escaped the Guardians of the Whills and escaped an Imperial blockade. At another location, Dok-Ondar is holding a recording of Hondo talking to Kendoh, and he told Hondo to just try to get Kendoh to pump information about her plan.\n\n",

They were stopped by a guardian who they quickly stunned. Quadoro questioned Captain Ohnaka on why he has to be in the front, to which he was quickly gunned down by more guardians. While Hondo continued to fight the guardians, Dok-Ondar located their target and began to admire the history of it. He felt that it brought him closer to his parents. Dok-Ondar used a laser torch to break off the statue from the rest of it's base but the lasers deflected off and shot to the ceiling which caused part of the ceiling to fall and take a guardian Hondo was fighting with it. Dok-Ondar used Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber instead to break off the statue. After doing so, Hondo quickly grabbed the Ithorian and they made their way to the exit. They were stopped by another guardian, this one introduced himself as Chirrut \u00cemwe and refused to let them pass by. Hondo underestimated the blind man and started to shoot at him. Chirrut dodged the blaster fire and knocked out Hondo. Hondo got back up and started to duel Chirrut with his own staff. Dok-Ondar intervened and stated that this statue was a clue to figuring out the murder of his parents. Chirrut let them go and the two returned to the ship.\n\nAs they left they were spotted a Imperial starfighter who was on patrol. Hondo started to fly toward the Star Destroyer over head stating that the starfighters will not fire on their own ship. As he flew closer to the ship, he took off into hyperspace.\n\n",

The father died during a supply run accident leaving his wife and four children to run a grain farm.\n\nOne day while the four children were playing by edge of the Surabat River Valley Anya's brother went missing. The girls searched for their brother until dusk but they could not find him. They eventually went home hoping that he was there but he was not. Anya's Mother had warn the children not to play by the valley but had not told them that it was because the slaver Sampa Grott would sometimes abduct people from the valley and put them to work. Knowing that her son was lost forever Anya's mother fell into despair.\n\nHowever the girls still had hope and the next morning Anya's oldest sister left for Black Spire Outpost armed with her late father's farming sickle to search for her brother. That night having not returned it seemed that the oldest sister had also be captured by the slavers and the mom fell deeper into despair. The next morning however the middle sister made the decision to leave to search for both her brother and sister. Leaving Anya to look after their mother the girl left armed with her late father's blaster. But that sister did not return. Anya not able to endure her mother's cries fled into the goods and began to sob.\n\nA robed man, having heard the crying and wishing to help, approached Anya in the woods. Initially afraid of the man, thinking he might be another slaver, Anya eventually told him how she lost her siblings. After hearing the tale the man encouraged Anya to go after her siblings believing she was the only one that could save them. Since Anya did not have a weapon the stranger fashioned a small wooden dagger from a fallen branch. After that the man disappeared into the woods.\n\nThe next morning Anya left for Black Spire Outpost armed with her dagger. Eventually while searching the Outpost Anya over heard a Gran and a Ithorian talking about Sampa Grott. The Gran has recently been tricked by Sampa and was about to head over to Sampa to confront him. Anya followed the Gran to the hidden junkyard, Sampa's Cradle. Once there she seeing that Sampa Grott was big brutal man that could not have been easily beaten in a fight Anya decided she had to come up with a more clever plan to save her siblings.\n\nAnya found Sampa's house and hid under his bed and waited for him to return home. After Sampa fell asleep Anya crept up and put her wooden dagger to his throat. Feeling the tip of the dagger, Sampa's eyes opened but did not move fearing that his throat would be cut. Anya having disguised her voice told Sampa that she was an assassin and was sent to kill him. Sampa begged for his life and Anya told him if she released the three children she would let him live. Sampa quickly agreed and Anya left the house and headed home. The next morning her bother and two sisters had both been returned. Sampa was rumored to have fled into Wild Space where his enemies couldn't find him.\n\n",

Dok-Ondar was disappointed with how late the crew was, due to the First Order's arrival and Io needing to take a longer route through an alley. While there, the other member of Voss' crew, Wooro, noticed an infant sarlacc. Dok-Ondar told him the story of Solo smuggling them in from a reserve on I'vorcia Prime, but Voss immediately got to showing Dok-Ondar what she wants to sell him. When Dok-Ondar saw what was on the screen, a lightsaber, he asked them to leave immediately. His assistant asked him how that weapon could have been retrieved, and Dok-Ondar wanted to make sure it did not fall into the wrong hands.\n\nLater, the First Order arrived at Dok-Ondar's place to investigate the lightsaber that he owned. A stormtrooper sergeant threatened Dok-Ondar, saying all of his items could be reclassified as contraband and destroyed and also noting that owning a lightsaber could once again be a crime. When the stormtroopers left, Dok-Ondar noted to his assistant and translator Tohago that he planned to move the hilt of the sword to a safe location to prevent the First Order from discovering it.\n\nLater, Dok-Ondar sent his Clawdite enforcer Varg to intercept Io. Varg incapacitated Io and impersonated him to get on the inside of the Kendooh Gang. Then, Dok-Ondar listened in on a conversation between Voss and Hondo Ohnaka, who he was in league with. Voss revealed part of her plan to Ohnaka, trying to hire him as a pilot, unaware of his ties with Dok-Ondar. However, when Voss showed Ohnaka what the cargo was, the Sword of Khashyun, Dok-Ondar was furious to see Ohnaka reveal his knowledge of the sword to Voss.\n\nOhnaka made his way to Dok-Ondar to inform him of what he knew, but when he began to babble loudly in the street, Dok-Ondar angrily silenced him, warning him of the amount of spies in the area. Bringing him inside, Ohnaka told him what he knew, unaware that they were being spied on by a cam droid operated by the Kendoh Gang. Dok-Ondar explained the mission he and Aphra undertook on Moraband to Ohnaka, and when Ohnaka asked for more details, Dok-Ondar told him that they could talk more at the safe house, expressing his desire to move the hilt to Ohnaka's ship before it could be stolen. Just then, Voss and Wooro entered the den to steal the hilt. However, Dok-Ondar activated his primary security droid BK-86, but at the same time, a group of stormtroopers formed outside.\n\nThe stormtroopers entered, aiming their blasters at Dok-Ondar, Tohago, BK-86, Voss, and Wooro. After the stormtroopers beat Wooro and hit Voss on the chin with a blaster, they questioned Voss about her intentions on Batuu, believing her to be with the Resistance. Then, Voss improvised, eventually passing off the hilt to Wooro, who would unknowingly give it to Varg, thinking he was Io. Varg returned the hilt to Dok-Ondar, who then contacted Voss via hologram to reveal he was the benefactor that had hired them. Dok-Ondar told them that he could not afford to let them sell the blade and instead tried to unite the two pieces. As he succeeded in doing so, he told the crew that their payment was leaving the planet safely, saying he gave the First Order an anonymous tip regarding their location that would give them enough time to escape.\n\n",

He said that long before the Clone Wars, the Jedi set up a temple to research dark artifacts on Batuu. One day, Jedi Master Sylwin and her padawan, Ady Sun'Zee found one of these Dark Relic, and brought it back to the Temple for research. But the relic was powerful, and turned them all against each other. Master Sylein put up a fight, but was lost. Ady hit the distress beacon to warn the council, and blacked out. When she came to, she was in the Temple, and was being attacked by Demlins that were corrupted by the artifact. She held her own, using her Lightsaber Master Yoda appears. He had gotten wind of the distress beacon, and had come to help. Master Yoda said that it had been three days since the distress call was sent. Yoda then went alone to contain the relic. Despite Master Yoda's Orders, Ady followed him into the Temple. The security system in the Temple activated, and Ady battled more demlins, and security droids, and when finished, Ady resumed her search for the Artifact. She found a fake version, and when she touched it, it glowed red, and created vines all over the Temple. Ady used her lightsaber to cut her way through, until she found the real artifact. Ady grabbed it, and heard master Sylwins voice telling her that she would never be a Jedi. Ady cut her way through more vines, until she arrives in a room with master Yoda calmly, sitting down. Master Yoda tells her that it was her fault, and under the influence of the artifact, she killed everyone in the Temple. Demlins then emerged from the floor, and dragged Master Yoda down into a Chasm, while Ady's lightsaber failed to work. The walls were ripped away to reveal a swirling storm of red clouds and rock. Ady fought more and more demlins, until she heard Master Yoda's voice telling her that her weapon was not needed. Ady placed her Lightsaber on the glowing white pedestal, and everything went black. Ady woke up to Master Yoda using The Force to fight against the artifact, and she saw he was being overpowered. Yoda asked Ady for help, and together, they contained the artifact. Yoda sealed of the Temple, and reassured Ady that she can fight the Darkness within her. Seezelslak then finished his tale by saying that Ady hid the keys to the Temple somewhere on Batuu.\n\n",

While in search of tools to purchase for Kami's master, Carver Drow, the group found property developer Ozon Nimbee presenting to Black Spire residents on potential developments. Nimbee sought to construct buildings with unobstructed views of the Batuuan skies, which would necessitate cutting down very spires central to the outpost's identity. Despite of the refusal of the outpost residents, Nimbee tested using sabotage droids to cut down several spires near the outpost. The Jedi, witnessing the test, confronted Nimbee, who was berated by the townsfolk. Believing the only way to get buy-in for his plans was to cut down the spires within the outpost without permission, Nimbee released a swarm of his buzz droids on Black Spire Outpost. The Jedi and townsfolk fought the swarm of droids, destroying many of them. Soon, Drow arrived to destroy several more with his lightsaber and the Force. One droid, however, escaped notice before completely transecting the spire overlooking the milk stand. As the upper portion of the enormous spire fell, the Jedi used the Force to prevent it from crushing the milk stand and set it gently on the ground nearby. At some point, the fallen spire was placed upon its base once more, leaving behind the evidence of the clean cut. Following the defeat of Nimbee, Drow decided to promote relations with the local residents.\n\nTo foster friendly relations with the residents of Black Spire Outpost, the Jedi hosted at least two public training days outside the Temple. During a later visit to Batuu, Brightstar duelled with Master Drow during a public training day but experienced fears and doubts. At the advice of Drow, Brightstar later retreated to a cave where he experienced Force visions which helped him to overcome his doubts and insecurity. Following a second public training day, local girl Sadie Bolter stole Lys's lightsaber in order to overcome her own insecurities. However, the lightsaber was stolen by the local bully Pak Relda. Seeking to make amends with Solay and her friends, Bolter helped the Jedi to recover Lys's lightsaber and defeated Relda in a sword duel.\n\nLater, the Jedi Order abandoned the Batuu Jedi Temple after the facility was contaminated by an ancient Sith runestone, that claimed the lives of several Jedi including Master Sylwin. The sole survivor was Padawan Ady Sun'Zee. In response Master Yoda sealed the Batuu Temple with The Force, declaring it lost.\n\n",

One such being was the Weequay smuggler Hondo Ohnaka, who brought the modified YT-1300 light freighter named the Millennium Falcon to the outpost and established Ohnaka Transport Solutions, a shipping company that was a front for his smuggling operations. Based out of Docking Bay 5, the company frequently recruited flight crew members among the outpost's new arrivals.\n\nThe human mercenary Bazine Netal had been hired to search for the Millennium Falcon and purchase it from whomever had it in their possession. At Oga's Cantina, the smuggler told her stories of his history with the ship to stall for time as a Yarkoran sabacc player secretly contacted Mahjo Reeloo, who owed Ohnaka a favor after an incident in the Undervaults of Gwongdeen. Netal paid Ohnaka for the Falcon and delivered it to Beixander 9, where Reeloo posed as Netal's contact to accept delivery of the ship before returning it to the outpost. Ohnaka notified Chewbacca, a Wookiee and the ship's former co-pilot, that the Falcon was safe from Netal's employers. Though Ohnaka continued to use it for his business, he also expressed certainty that the ship would continue to aid \"the good guys.\"\n\nAncient ruins just outside of the outpost housed a Resistance base around that same time. Eventually, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren arrived at the outpost and took command of the First Order garrison, having learned that Rey was with a group of Resistance fugitives on Batuu. A battle between the factions took place in the outpost and above the planet.\n\n",

Before General Leia Organa leaves for Takodana, she gives Vi Moradi a new mission: to establish a new Resistance outpost on the planet Moradi has identified, and to bring Archex\u2014the former Cardinal\u2014to assist her. Before Moradi can depart for Batuu the next day, Organa transmits an announcement that Hosnian Prime and the Hosnian system have been destroyed by the First Order. Moradi's mission is put on hold.\n\nFour months after the Battle of Crait, Moradi's mission is back on. Alongside the PK-Ultra worker droid Pook, she picks up Archex from his enforced healing retreat on Cerea and they journey to Batuu. Their starship is caught in a skirmish between two smuggler ships upon arrival and they are forced to crash land in the forest. While unconscious, their ship is ransacked by the crew of the local crime boss, Oga Garra. A local Batuuan woman, Salju, find them and offers assistance. She gives Moradi a tour of Black Spire Outpost and gets her a job at Savi & Son Salvage to earn money to buy back her own equipment to establish a Resistance base. Through her new work, Moradi meets Ylena and Savi's Gatherers, but fails to recruit them to the Resistance. Due to limited mobility resulting from wounds inflicted by Phasma, Archex must remain hidden in the forest, leaving him feeling useless.\n\nMoradi is taken by one of Garra's enforcers to meet the crime boss within her cantina. Garra tells her that if she locates an artifact within the ruins and brings it back to Garra, Moradi can have her property back. Moradi secures Garra's agreement that the Resistance may also use the ruins as a base. Meanwhile, the First Order is alerted to the Resistance presence on Batuu, and General Hux dispatches Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath and twenty stormtroopers to inspect the world. Kath has a vendetta against Moradi and Archex after failing to prevent their escape from the Absolution.\n\nGarra offers to tell Kath of the Resistance if Kath brings her the artifact in the ruins. Kath and two troopers enter the ruins, following Moradi as she negotiates the ancient security measures. Two troopers are downed by Vi, though the latter becomes poisoned. Moradi is rescued by a farm boy named Dolin and his truffleboar Waba. Dolin brings him to his grandmother Grana and they nurse her back to health, but when Moradi persuades Dolin to join the Resistance, Grana rejects her grandson.\n\nMoradi gives the artifact to Garra and regains most of her property except her long range comm array, which is what she needs most to update General Organa of her situation. The next day, Moradi goes into town to buy a comm array and defends a Chadra-Fan named Kriki who is being mistreated by her employer. Kriki chooses to join the Resistance, helping Moradi with her errands and fixing up the new base within the ruins, the layout of which is being planned by Archex. Later on, Moradi recruits a drunken but charismatic loudmouth named Zade Kalliday, who helps manage the recruitment of Resistance personnel. Soon after, while Moradi is picking up lunch, she witnesses stormtroopers harassing two old women seeking information on Moradi. When she defends the women, she is overwhelmed by the two troopers, who take her prisoner.\n\nAfter undergoing torture by Kath, Moradi is rescued by her new companions. By then, multiple stormtroopers have been killed, leaving only twelve. Moradi and her three recruits make a plan to get the First Order to leave Batuu despite being outnumbered. She uses a stolen First Order comm link to tap into their network and send out a message to the Resistance, requesting that Organa send supplies and personnel, but Organa informs her that none are available and she has faith in Moradi. Dolin also goes back to his village to recruit for the upcoming attack, but his grandmother disowns him. Having no other options, the group proceeds with their plan.\n\nMoradi pretends to get captured and is again interrogated by Kath. She manipulates Kath's pride to start a boxing match, allowing Kriki to get on board to program the ship to send a message that the Resistance is no longer on Batuu before the ship self destructs.

        "content": "# Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire - Plot summary[]\n\nOn D'Qar, Vi Moradi is still recovering physically and psychologically from her interrogation on the Absolution by Captain Cardinal, whom she rescued after his near-fatal confrontation with Phasma. Before General Leia Organa leaves for Takodana, she gives Vi Moradi a new mission: to establish a new Resistance outpost on the planet Moradi has identified, and to bring Archex\u2014the former Cardinal\u2014to assist her. Before Moradi can depart for Batuu the next day, Organa transmits an announcement that Hosnian Prime and the Hosnian system have been destroyed by the First Order. Moradi's mission is put on hold.\n\nFour months after the Battle of Crait, Moradi's mission is back on. Alongside the PK-Ultra worker droid Pook, she picks up Archex from his enforced healing retreat on Cerea and they journey to Batuu. Their starship is caught in a skirmish between two smuggler ships upon arrival and they are forced to crash land in the forest. While unconscious, their ship is ransacked by the crew of the local crime boss, Oga Garra. A local Batuuan woman, Salju, find them and offers assistance. She gives Moradi a tour of Black Spire Outpost and gets her a job at Savi & Son Salvage to earn money to buy back her own equipment to establish a Resistance base. Through her new work, Moradi meets Ylena and Savi's Gatherers, but fails to recruit them to the Resistance. Due to limited mobility resulting from wounds inflicted by Phasma, Archex must remain hidden in the forest, leaving him feeling useless.\n\nMoradi is taken by one of Garra's enforcers to meet the crime boss within her cantina. Garra tells her that if she locates an artifact within the ruins and brings it back to Garra, Moradi can have her property back. Moradi secures Garra's agreement that the Resistance may also use the ruins as a base. Meanwhile, the First Order is alerted to the Resistance presence on Batuu, and General Hux dispatches Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath and twenty stormtroopers to inspect the world. Kath has a vendetta against Moradi and Archex after failing to prevent their escape from the Absolution.\n\nGarra offers to tell Kath of the Resistance if Kath brings her the artifact in the ruins. Kath and two troopers enter the ruins, following Moradi as she negotiates the ancient security measures. Two troopers are downed by Vi, though the latter becomes poisoned. Moradi is rescued by a farm boy named Dolin and his truffleboar Waba. Dolin brings him to his grandmother Grana and they nurse her back to health, but when Moradi persuades Dolin to join the Resistance, Grana rejects her grandson.\n\nMoradi gives the artifact to Garra and regains most of her property except her long range comm array, which is what she needs most to update General Organa of her situation. The next day, Moradi goes into town to buy a comm array and defends a Chadra-Fan named Kriki who is being mistreated by her employer. Kriki chooses to join the Resistance, helping Moradi with her errands and fixing up the new base within the ruins, the layout of which is being planned by Archex. Later on, Moradi recruits a drunken but charismatic loudmouth named Zade Kalliday, who helps manage the recruitment of Resistance personnel. Soon after, while Moradi is picking up lunch, she witnesses stormtroopers harassing two old women seeking information on Moradi. When she defends the women, she is overwhelmed by the two troopers, who take her prisoner.\n\nAfter undergoing torture by Kath, Moradi is rescued by her new companions. By then, multiple stormtroopers have been killed, leaving only twelve. Moradi and her three recruits make a plan to get the First Order to leave Batuu despite being outnumbered. She uses a stolen First Order comm link to tap into their network and send out a message to the Resistance, requesting that Organa send supplies and personnel, but Organa informs her that none are available and she has faith in Moradi. Dolin also goes back to his village to recruit for the upcoming attack, but his grandmother disowns him. Having no other options, the group proceeds with their plan.",

        "content": "# Batuu Jedi temple - Layout[]\n\nEstablished along the Galactic Frontier in the Trilon sector, the Batuu Jedi temple was set up as a research facility for the Jedi Order, not far from Black Spire Outpost. Located within a forest punctuated by the petrified trunks of enormous trees, the Temple itself was a large facility with several large towers of white stone. The main body of the Temple was a large, blocky building with two short wings protruding on either side of the building. One end of the main structure was surrounded by several small towers buttressing its walls. On either side of the Temple were two tall towers that were capped by a domed roof that bulged out just below the peak. A larger central spire erupted from the center of the Temple, the pinnacle of which resembled the three-finned crown of the Grand Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\nThe interior of the Temple was austere and sparse, with large open rooms connected by pillared halls. The Temple's main hall, constructed of white stone, contained a large statue of a Jedi surrounded by doors that opened onto exterior balconies. Just off the hall was a chamber which housed several artifacts, including an ancient Sith Runestone which was permeated by the dark side of the Force. An Archives, located in a small rotunda, contained a wealth of journals and holobooks just off of a large main hall. Down a winding set of stairs was a specialized containment room equipped with electrical nodes and a scaleable control floor and observation portal. A large, circular lecture hall with a circular speaker's pit ringed by benches was the crosspoint of a number of corridors near the artifact containment rooms. A metal dome over the speaker's pit denoted astronomical bodies, with a replica of the planet Batuu sitting at the center of the hall.\n\n",

Solay noted that the stately, stony complex of white towers was different from the Tenoo Jedi Temple, which had a giant Tenoo tree. To foster friendly relations with the local residents of Black Spire Outpost, the Jedi hosted several public training days outside the Temple.\n\nDuring the High Republic Era, Jedi Master Sylwin worked within the Temple with several other Jedi, including her Padawan Ady Sun'Zee. During the Jedi's study of an ancient Sith Runestone delivered to the Temple by Jedi Master Cohmac Vitus, the dark side energies that inhabited the crystal were unleashed and corrupted the Temple and Sylwin and the other Jedi succumbed to the whispers in their minds. Before succumbing to unconsciousness, Sun'Zee was able to activate the Temple's distress beacon and signal the Jedi High Council that the Temple was in trouble. When Sun'Zee awoke three days later, she was attacked by demlins, native creatures that had been corrupted and made feral by the runestone's influence from deep in the Temple. Unable to remember what happened, Sun'Zee was relieved when Grand Master Yoda arrived in response to the signal. Entering the Temple, the Jedi found it filled with ominous dark vines emanating from the runestone. Fighting through the corruption and the Temple's security systems, together Sun'Zee and Master Yoda were able to contain the darkness back inside the rhinestone's casing. While Sun'Zee had been convinced that she had killed the other Jedi at the Temple, Master Yoda assured her that it was an illusion create by the artifact, and that Sun'Zee's ability to resist it made her worthy of knighthood. Sealing the Temple with the Force, Yoda declared the Temple lost, and he and Sun'Zee returned to Coruscant.\n\n",

While Deek believed it to hold historic value, antique dealer Dok-Ondar knew that the mural actually was a key to locating the treasure vaults in the lost Jedi Temple and hired a treasure hunter to retrieve the key for him. While Deek believed they were in danger, the Listehol Baron Yasto Attsmun, a band of pirates trailing behind him, and an independent hunter Lens Kamo all competed to find the cipher and the vault. Searching the Chasm for Deek and the cipher, it was soon revealed that Deek had indeed been killed after hiding the relic to prevent it from being sold on the black market. Searching further through the Chasm's excavation site, Dok-Ondar's hunter found where the Mural of the Light had been located before Deek had carved it from the wall. Continuing on, the hunter located a band of pirates trying to load the relic for transport and sale. Defeating the pirates and scanning the cipher, the hunter returned to Dok-Ondar's only to discover that the mural was only part of the cipher. Setting out to search the Cavern of the Moons for the rest of the cipher, the hunter located a stone altar dedicated to the Convergence of the Moons, which hid an ancient and secret vault more recently used by Deek to hide his treasures. Deep within the cavern's subterranean chambers, the hunter located a site that was adorned with Jedi murals depicting a mysterious ritual. Scanning the cipher embedded int he mural, the hunter was able to transmit their findings to Dok-Ondar for analysis.\n\nOnce deciphered, the key revealed the locations of the Temple ruins, and Dok-Ondar was able to surmise the existence of the ancient Sith Runestone left there by Master Yoda and Padawan Sun'Zee. Entering the Temple's lower levels, the hunter found it set with booby-traps laid by Lens Kamo. Evading the traps, the hunter eventually joined Kamo in infiltrating the vault, taking the runestone, and evading the defense droids sent out by Baron Attsmun. Eventually the pair were detained by the Baron's droids in one of the Temple's halls and Attsmun unleashed Kamo's former partner Ayuu, who had been cybernetically altered into a raging brute, against them. Ayuu smashed through the Temple's ancient foundations, sending the group tumbling into the caverns below. After Ayuu turned on the Baron and smashed his head in, the three treasure hunters escaped the ruins of the ancient Jedi Temple alive.\n\n",

The group already possessed the blade and was intent on cashing in with their anonymous benefactor by assembling the completed sword. During their time there, the First Order put out an arrest warrant for Remex Io, the crew's Clawdite member. Dok-Ondar's fixer, Varg, had notified the First Order of Io's presence, and Io was confronted by stormtroopers. He fled into the market and was pursued by the troopers, resulting in the death of a nearby civilian. After losing sight of Io, the stormtroopers were informed by a local, who was actually Io using his natural shape-shifting abilities, that their target was running toward the spaceport. Varg then caught Io himself, incapacitating him and then using his own shapeshifting powers to impersonate him and join up with Kendoh Voss and Wooro at Oga's Cantina. Voss spoke with Hondo Ohnaka, a former pirate captain who ran Ohnaka Transport Solutions, about their heist, unaware Ohnaka was in league with Dok-Ondar.\n\nOhnaka eventually reported back to Dok-Ondar but was spied on by a cam droid operated by the Kendoh Gang. When Voss and Wooro moved to steal the hilt, a group of stormtroopers surrounded the would-be thieves as well as Dok-Ondar, all of whom the First Order thought had possible ties to the rise in Resistance activity in the area. When the First Order inquired about Voss' activities, the gangster knocked over a kyber statue, which deflected the blaster fire aimed at her. Voss escalated the chaos by unleashing a baby sarlacc and using the opportunity to pass Wooro the hilt. However, Wooro would give the hilt to Io, who was actually Varg. The group escaped the First Order but soon realized that they had been tricked. Wooro found Io back at the ship and realized the hilt had been stolen back. Dok-Ondar then contacted Voss via hologram, saying that he had been the anonymous benefactor and told them that their payment was a favor he did for them, which was to trick the First Order into pursuing an anonymous lead that would give them time to escape.\n\nDuring the First Order's occupation, stormtroopers frequently patrolled the outpost as they stayed alert to signs of the Resistance.",

During the Clone Wars, Sidious was aware that his second apprentice, Darth Tyranus, plotted to usurp his title of Sith Master by killing him. Sensing that Tyranus' betrayal was imminent, Sidious successfully conspired to have his student killed by his intended replacement, the Jedi Knight and prophesied Chosen One Anakin Skywalker.\n\n",

At some point during his life, Plagueis acquired the protocol droid 11-4D. During his time as a Sith Lord and studying the Force, Plagueis acquired a vast amount of knowledge about the dark side and its teachings.\n\nDuring the High Republic Era, Plagueis was actively working against the Jedi. By 132 BBY, he had taken on a former Jedi\u2014a human known as \"the Stranger\" or by the pseudonym \"Qimir\"\u2014as his apprentice. In that year, Plagueis was present on an island on a planet inhabited by the Stranger. While there, he lurked in the shadows of the Stranger's cave abode as he observed the Stranger and the former Jedi Padawan Verosha Aniseya, whom the Stranger would take on as a Sith acolyte, depart from the planet in their ship, Exile II. Plagueis was still lurking there when the Stranger and Aniseya returned, Aniseya now the Stranger's apprentice.\n\n",

        "content": "# Darth Plagueis - Master of Darth Sidious[]\n\nThe precise time when Plagueis came to acquire his new Sith apprentice was unknown, but the Dark Lord chose Sheev Palpatine, a human from Naboo, as his pupil. As master and disciple, Plagueis and Palpatine\u2014who took the Sith moniker Darth Sidious\u2014worked together for years, trying to unlock the secrets of immortality as Plagueis lusted for it and to execute the Sith Order's long-percolating plan of supplanting the Galactic Republic with a new Sith Empire.\n\nWhile training Sidious, Plagueis taught him that two Sith were required for their perilous machinations. So, if they worked together in accordance to the Rule of Two, with one of them serving as a bait for the dark side of the Force and the other as a vessel, they would succeed in acquiring the ability to harness the full power of the dark side and rule immortal for ten thousand years. While apprenticed by Plagueis, Sidious also built his own lightsabers.\n\nBelieving the secrets to immortality to lie in science, Plagueis conducted in-depth research into the biological underpinnings of life. Some of that research constituted unnatural experiments, through his ability to coax the midi-chlorians, in an attempt to cheat death, that, though incomplete, were encouraging to his apprentice. The Sith Order had long coveted the ability to live forever, unwilling to accept the Jedi Order's belief that death was a natural part of life, but over the centuries generations of Sith Lords failed to unlock the ability that led to eternal life. He was so obsessed with the subject that he ignored the signs that his \"faithful apprentice\" was progressing in a disturbing way for him.\n\nAccording to Darth Sidious' book, The Secrets of the Sith, Plagueis discovered a form of immortality through transference, a Force power that allowed the user to transfer his consciousness to another body, essentially using bodies as vessels. Plagueis also attempted to forge a Force dyad with Sidious, a unique Force-bond as strong as life itself, which was discovered from the Doctrine of the Dyad, the predecessor to the Rule of Two. However, Plagueis was unsuccessful in forming the dyad.\n\nDarth Plagueis had arranged for his apprentice to become the Senator of Naboo and the rest of the Chommell sector with Palpatine being elected in 52 BBY. By the time that Sidious, under his public persona of Sheev Palpatine, was appointed to the Galactic Senate as the Senator of Naboo, Plagueis was still teaching him, which allowed Palpatine to sharpen his political skills within the plan imagined for him by his master, before they returned to Coruscant.\n\n",

        "content": "# Darth Plagueis - Transference[]\n\nDuring the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Sidious was killed by a redeemed Anakin Skywalker, who turned back to the light side of the Force and threw Sidious down a reactor shaft to save his son Luke Skywalker. While falling, however, Sidious reflected that he had prepared himself for that scenario unlike Plagueis and called on all the power of the dark side to leave his body and thrust his consciousness to a cloned body created by the Sith Eternal on the secret Sith world of Exegol.\n\nWhen Sidious used Plagueis' secret to immortality and his own research into mix of Sith sorcery and technology to resurrect his spirit in a new vessel, he was able to stave off death for a time, but immortality still eluded the Dark Lord. To this end, the transfer was imperfect; when Sidious thrusted his essence toward the new cloned vessel, and had awoken, he realized the painful, temporary existence he was now within, the body racked with decay in consequence to his massive power within the dark side of the Force, leading the Sith Lord toward death permanently if not dealt with. Because of this, Sidious mused that perhaps Plagueis, in the end, was having the final laugh over his apprentice, as karma for his demise.\n\nIn the years following the Empire's end, during the final stages of the war between the First Order and the Resistance, Sidious' granddaughter, Rey tracked him down to Exegol as the Resistance and the Sith Eternal prepared for a final showdown. Before a redeemed Ben Solo came to her rescue, Sidious insisted his granddaughter to strike him down as he did with Plagueis, allowing Rey to read his mind and discover how he came back thanks to Plagueis' teachings. Ultimately, Rey used the voices and power of the past and deceased Jedi to permanently destroy Sidious and the Sith for good.\n\nIn the wake of victory at the aftermath of the Battle of Exegol, the Exegol Excavation Project was launched to excavate the Sith Citadel on Exegol. The archeological endeavor led by Beaumont Kin managed to uncover a file regarding Darth Plagueis within the Arcane Library. According to Kin's notes as provided in the book The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire, the file was notably defaced, but the information contained within brought to life the existence of Darth Plagueis and help construct an incomplete hierarchy of information about the known Sith Lords.\n\n",

        "content": "# Darth Plagueis - Behind the scenes[]\n\nDarth Plagueis was first mentioned on-screen in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the third and final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Although Palpatine was never confirmed to be Plagueis' apprentice in the movie itself, a link to the official encyclopedia on StarWars.com did refer to Sidious as having been \"trained by Darth Plagueis.\" He first appeared unnamed in \"The Acolyte,\" the eponymous eighth episode of the 2024 television series The Acolyte, his identity in the episode being later confirmed by showrunner Leslye Headland in an interview. There, the character's appearance in the episode was rendered entirely with computer-generated imagery, without the use of motion capture. Before his appearance in The Acolyte, Plagueis was first pictured via silhouette in the reference book Star Wars Made Easy.\n\nThe character was created by George Lucas as early as the first draft of Revenge of the Sith\u2014dated April 2003\u2014and possibly earlier. His story was massively expanded upon in the 2012 Star Wars Legends novel Darth Plagueis, written by James Luceno. It notably established Plagueis to be a Muun, just as Lucas proposed, a trait that was used once more in The Acolyte and had been canonized prior by the reference book Endless Vigil. All the same, prior to The Acolyte, Plagueis' canon appearance was kept hidden via his silhouettes in Star Wars Made Easy and Star Wars: The Secrets of the Sith. Plagueis was always intended to appear in the season 1 finale of The Acolyte. Headland later confirmed that Plagueis was the Master of \"the Stranger\" when speaking with Entertainment Weekly. Having been talking immediately beforehand about the character's cameo in the episode alongside that of Yoda, Headland stated \"We wanted to show Qimir's master. We weren't going to wait a second season for that.\"\n\nAlthough Legends works show that Plagueis had power over life and death, Lucas himself stated Palpatine's tale about Plagueis' abilities was a lie. Canon also dispensed with the idea of these powers being a lie. The Biography gallery of Darth Sidious' Databank entry and the \"Senator Palpatine\" card part of 2020 Topps Star Wars Holocron Series both state that Plagueis was killed by Sidious after he took Darth Maul as his apprentice. However, the 2019 reference book Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition lists Plagueis' murder at Sidious' hands as taking place before Sidious takes Maul under his wing.\n\n",

        "content": "# Darth Plagueis - The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise[]\n\nIn the waning days of the Republic, Sidious recounted the history of his late master to Skywalker, whom he befriended years before the Clone Wars in an effort to gradually turn him to the dark side of the Force. Skywalker, who was unaware at the time that his friend was in fact a Sith Lord, and having developed premonitions of his secret wife's death in childbirth, was intrigued by the story of Plagueis, particularly his ability to prevent death. When the fear of loss drove Skywalker to betray the Jedi Order, turning him into the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Sidious reformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and declared himself Emperor. At the same time, he had the Jedi systematically executed throughout the galaxy by Order 66, completing the Sith plan that lasted for over a millennium.\n\nOne of the few Jedi to survive was a Padawan named Ferren Barr. Barr began investigating as to why the Jedi fell so quickly and learned of Plagueis' existence, putting his file on him in his list of individuals involved in the crisis. In the years that followed his rise to power, Sidious came to genuinely, if posthumously, appreciate Plagueis for the planner and prophet he had been. Sometimes, Sidious mused about how his late master would have reacted when confronted with the trivial, day-to-day matters of Imperial politics, remarking that Plagueis never foresaw that he would become Emperor. Sidious desired not just the immortaltiy his master had craved and achieved, but the power to fashion a universe of his own creation, and make it so the Force could not \"strike back\".\n\nPlagueis' failure to form a dyad with his apprentice had convinced Sidious that his master was unworthy of the task. However, Sidious also failed to recreate the dyad with his own disciple Vader, despite their combined power as scions of the two strongest Force-sensitive bloodlines, the Palpatines and the Skywalkers. In 3 ABY, cultists searching the catacombs beneath the Sith Citadel on the planet Exegol, a secret Sith world that Palpatine had taken over, repeated Plagueis' name in something similar to a chant, along with the names of other Sith.\n\n",
