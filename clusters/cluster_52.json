The rhyme was recited as \"Loth-rat, Loth-cat, Loth-wolf, run. Pick a path and all is done,\" and was used as a method of selection. As a child, Lothalite Ezra Bridger was taught the rhyme by his mother prior to her imprisonment by the Galactic Empire in 12 BBY. Bridger recited the rhyme in two instances: to select one of three paths in the Lothal Jedi Temple when he was brought there by his Master Kanan Jarrus in 4 BBY, and again to decide which direction to go while on Lothal in 1 BBY. The Galactic Society of Creature Enthusiasts' Director of Creature Cartography Ardis San Tekka mentioned the rhyme in the Loth-wolf entry of her bestiary at some point after the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY.\n\n",
